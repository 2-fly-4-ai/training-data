They aren't particularly interactive or cuddly creatures, they can carry diseases, and with their famously long lifespans, they may even outlive you. All turtles also have complex housing and feeding requirements that you'll need to consider.</p><p>There are a wide variety of turtle species, and some make better pets than others. Some will grow to a very large size, others are known for being more sociable and less aggressive than others, and they will all have different requirements in terms of space, lighting, and diet.</p><p>We have listed ten turtle species that are popular pets, along with some details about their care requirements to help you kick start your research on whether a turtle will be right for your household.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Turtles aren't generally a good choice of pet for young children. They can become stressed or aggressive if handled too much or improperly. Turtles can also carry the salmonella bacteria, which could be transferred to children if they don't have good hygiene practices.</p><h2>Red-Eared Slider</h2><p>Red-eared sliders are one of the most popular of all aquatic turtle species. They tend to be friendlier and more sociable than some of their relatives, they're pretty active, and they're widely available.</p><p>These turtles are generally housed indoors, but with the right shelter, cleaning, and warmer temperatures, they can also do well in an outdoor pond. As they mature, it can be easier to provide them with the space they need outside.</p><p>Red-eared sliders can grow to a decent size, and their tank will need to be large and have adequate areas for basking. It will need UV lighting and a good water filtration system. These guys are known for being rather messy!</p><p>Their size, subsequent dietary needs, and larger housing requirements mean they can be more expensive to look after than some turtles. With the right care, though, they're generally a hardy and healthy species that frequently surpass 50 years of age.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Red-eared slider turtle, red-eared slider, red-eared terrapin,red-eared turtle,slider turtle,water slider turtle</p><p>Adult Size:Around 12 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30 years</p><h2>African Sideneck Turtle</h2><p>These unique little aquatic turtles have distinctive long necks that can't be retracted fully into their shell, and their anatomy differs from traditional water-based turtles.</p><p>Because of their unique appearance and size, they're often a popular choice, but they have more complex care requirements than some other turtles.</p><p>African sideneck turtles water needs to be kept very clean and requires weekly changing. A good filtration system, however, facilitates less frequent changing.</p><p>Despite their small size, they enjoy swimming and need a large tank, ideally at least 75-gallons. They need suitable basking platforms with UV lights for them to lie under and the temperature should never drop below 70 degrees. This is one of the reasons that they're best kept indoors.</p><p>They also need a fresh and varied diet to prevent Vitamin A and D3 deficiencies.</p><p>Sidenecks can be curious turtles that, if you don't force interactions, won't scuttle away to hide when you come to observe them.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:African side-neck turtle, African Side-necked turtle, African helmeted turtle</p><p>Adult Size:Average of 8 to 12 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can be up to (and sometimes more than) 50 years</p><h2>Eastern Box Turtle</h2><p>Eastern box turtles need a lot of space, but they're adaptable and, with the right housing, they can live in or outdoors.</p><p>They prefer a humid environment, need a shallow pool of water in their enclosure, a moist substrate, and they will need a UVB basking light if they're kept indoors.</p><p>If their environment is too cold and dry, it can lead to them more easily picking up respiratory infections.</p><p>These turtles can be shy, but they don't tend to be aggressive, and with the right gentle interactions and minimal handling, you can start to see their personality come out. They may even be tempted out to greet you if you have a tasty tidbit.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Eastern box turtle, land turtle</p><p>Adult Size:5 to 7 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 40 to 50 years in captivity with good care (and up to 100 years in the wild)</p><h2>Western Painted Turtle </h2><p>A Western painted turtle could appeal if you want a turtle that is distinctive and attractive to look at. They have detailed shell markings.</p><p>Although they aren't big, these aquatic turtles need a large tank or outdoor space, a good water filtration system and basking lights to help maintain a warm temperature. Their housing needs are similar to that of the red-eared slider.</p><p>They can be quite shy and aren't turtles that will enjoy frequent handling.</p><p>Because they like to eat while swimming, selecting food that can be easily lifted out of the water if it isn't eaten is a good choice to help keep the tank clean for longer.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Western Painted Turtle</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 10 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can be up to (and sometimes more than) 50 years</p><h2>Mississippi Map Turtle</h2><p>0 Generic License</p><p>Mississippi map turtles have a distinctive dorsal fin running along their shell, and this is why they're also sometimes referred to as the 'Sawback'.</p><p>They don't need quite as big enclosures as some of their aquatic turtle relatives, and this can make them an appealing choice for those with space limitations.</p><p>While they can still live up to 30 years, their lifespan is a bit shorter than average.</p><p>They can be warier of people than some other turtles, and this means they can be more prone to stress. You'll need to keep handling to a minimum and create an environment that allows them peace and places to take cover.</p><p>Map turtles tend to be quite hardy and less prone to health issues than some species. Clean water, good lighting, and an appropriate diet is still absolutely essential though to prevent fungal infections and deficiencies developing.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Mississippi Map Turtle</p><p>Adult Size: Females grow to be up to 10 inches long and males up to five inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15- 25 years but up to and over 30 years possible</p><h2>Common Musk Turtle (Stinkpot)</h2><p>NPS Photo / M.Reed / Flckr / Creative Commons Public Domain Mark I</p><p>Common musk turtles are one of the more popular aquatic turtle species. They're small, and their care requirements are a little less intensive than some.</p><p>They aren't turtles that do well with a lot of handling though. They can be feisty and, if they feel threatened, they release a foul and musty odor. This is why they get their nickname: 'The Stinkpot'.</p><p>They aren't as strong swimmers as some aquatic turtles, so the water in their enclosure shouldn't be too deep. They should also have plenty of areas to get out of the water easily to bask under UVB lighting.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Common Musk Turtle, Eastern Musk Turtle, Stinkpot</p><p>Adult Size: 3 to 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to and even over 50 years</p><h2>Spotted Turtle</h2><p>0</p><p>If you have limited space and are looking for an aquatic turtle, the spotted turtle is one of the smallest species allowed to be kept in captivity. They're also pretty to look at with their distinctive spotted shell and, with the right housing, they can live indoors or out.</p><p>They're a long-term commitment though, with some living to be over 100 years of age!</p><p>Like musk turtles, they aren't particularly strong swimmers, so their water should not be too deep. They also need warm basking platforms and ornaments that provide them with the opportunity to get out to rest.</p><p>A good varied diet with plenty of meat, along with some leafy greens and fruit is important too.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Spotted Turtle, Clemmy, Michigan Spotted Turtle</p><p>Adult Size: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can easily live up to 50 years, with some recorded as living over 100 years</p><h2>Yellow-Bellied Slider</h2><p>Yellow-bellied sliders are one of the most popular aquatic turtle species to keep as pets as they tend to be relatively hardy, providing they get the right diet, enclosure and lighting.</p><p>Unlike some turtles, they tend to be most active during the day, which appeals to a lot of owners looking to observe them.</p><p>They need a large tank or suitable outdoor enclosure as they're bigger than the likes of the Stinkpot or the spotted turtle.</p><p>Because of their popularity, they're relatively easy to come by. Just make sure you still source your yellow-bellied slider from a reputable breeder or supplier.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Yellow-bellied slider</p><p>Adult Size: Adult males from 5 to 9 inches long. Females between 8 and 13 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 40 years</p><h2>Reeve's Turtle </h2><p>0</p><p>The Reeve's turtle is probably one of the most sociable of all the turtles on this list. With care and patience, they sometimes even enjoy being stroked, which is unusual for an aquatic turtle. Of course, handling can still be stressful for them, so this should only be done when needed.</p><p>Their care requirements are similar to the red-eared slider, although they're smaller and don't require such a large enclosure.</p><p>They tend to be a relatively healthy turtle, although they don't have such a long life expectancy. This may appeal to owners not looking for such a lengthy commitment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Reeve's Turtle, Chinese pond turtle, Chinese three-keeled pond turtle</p><p>Adult Size: 6 to 9 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10-15 years usually or up to 20 years</p><h2>Wood Turtle </h2><p>0</p><p>The Wood Turtle is known for being very friendly, with the right handling and interaction, and pretty hardy. Their needs aren't as complex as most aquatic species. They do need a decent-sized enclosure though, and this means they're often best suited to being kept in an outdoor environment.</p><p>Because they aren't aquatic, they could drown in water too deep, so it's important to keep their pond area at a suitably low level.</p><p>They also need a diet that is high in protein, comprising plenty of proteins like insects, slugs, earthworms, snails, and more along with leafy greens.</p><p>These turtles aren't so easy to come by and can be illegal to keep in certain States. You should make sure you do your research and ensure you're sourcing a wood turtle from a reputable and ethical breeder.</p>",1717
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/diamondback-terrapins-1238352,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Should You Keep a Diamondback Terrapin as a Pet? </h1>,"<h1>Should You Keep a Diamondback Terrapin as a Pet? </h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Diamondback terrapins are fairly docile turtles that are generally willing to be handled, although they may bite if they feel threatened. It is legal to own terrapins, and they are relatively easy to care for. These reptiles do like the company of other terrapins, though, so it's best to own more than one if you can provide a spacious enough enclosure. Their enclosure must also be large enough to contain several inches of brackish (salty) water in which the turtles can swim.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Diamondback terrapin, DB terrapin</p><p>Adult Size: up to 8 inches long (females); 5 inches (males)</p><p>Lifespan: 25 to 40 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Diamondback Terrapin as a Pet? </h2><h3>Legality </h3><p>It is legal to keep the diamondback terrapin as a pet as long as it is purchased from a licensed captive turtle breeder. It is illegal to capture a wild turtle and keep it for a pet. However, North Carolina and South Dakota have banned all turtle sales. In addition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prohibits the sale of live turtles with a carapace (shell) that measures less than 4 inches in length.</p><h3>Ethics </h3><p>While wild animals are naturally happier and healthier in their native habitats, it is generally considered ethical to keep captive-bred turtles as pets. As long as terrapins are kept in proper conditions and fed the food they need, these turtles can thrive.</p><h3>Things to Consider </h3><p>Even though it is legal to own terrapins, you can't just buy one, bring it home, and put it in a fish tank. Terrapins must be kept in specific conditions and fed foods that will sustain them. It is important to research exactly what a terrapin needs and prepare your home to welcome this pet.</p><h2>Diamondback Terrapin Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>These turtles are social and prefer the company of members of their immediate family like parents and siblings. They are known to share resources, like piling atop one another to concurrently take advantage of the best basking rock.</p><p>During the day, terrapins enjoy basking in the sun (or under a heat lamp), often in social groups. You can raise a single turtle successfully, but diamondbacks are fairly social and do even better in groupsprovided there is enough space for everyone. Chronically overcrowded diamondbacks may feel stressed and nip at one another's tails.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Pet terrapins will require brackish water in captivity that matches their habitat in the wild. Terrapins kept in unsalted freshwater begin exhibiting health problems from the lack of salt.</p><p>As aquatic turtles, diamondback terrapins need a tank filled with brackish water that is deep enough for the turtle to swim and dive in comfortably. Look for a 75-gallon or larger tank, and aim for a water depth that is at least three times as deep as the length of the turtle's current shell. They'll also need a wide, flat place to haul out of the water for comfortable group basking, like a rock or small log.</p><p>Water filtration is crucial to a diamondback terrapin's environment as these messy eaters usually create dirty water that will lead to skin and shell problems including shell rot. There is a variety of submersible, canister, and traditional water filters to choose from.</p><h3>Specific Substrate </h3><p>Crushed coral is recommended for thebottom of a terrapin's tank. It serves a dual purpose as both a substrate (tank flooring) and a calcium supplement. Diamondback terrapins like to bite at the coral, and they benefit from both the added calcium in their diet and the natural wear to their beaks as they crunch it.</p><h3>Heat </h3><p>Terrapins need a water temperature above 70 degrees; they mustn't get too cold. During the day, white heat lights can be used to add extra warmth to your tank. At night, use a ceramic heat emitter with only blue or red light. Water heaters designed for fish tanks can also be used to keep the water warm.</p><h3>Light </h3><p>Like other aquatic turtles, terrapins require UVB lights. UVB spectrum lights that are specifically designed for reptiles should be kept on for about 12 hours a day and positioned roughly 10 to 12 inches from where the turtle basks. This will enable your terrapin to grow and thrive as it would in natural sunlight. Without UVB light, your turtle is extremely likely to develop metabolic bone disease (MBD) and not grow properly.</p><h2>What Do Diamondback Terrapins Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Unlike most other pet aquatic turtles, diamondback terrapins primarily eat meat. In the wild, they eat a variety of small aquatic animals and occasionally graze on some plants. In captivity, you can feed them a mix of turtle pellets, dried shrimp, smelt, snails, and other accessible seafood once a day. Feed every other day, once during that day, and promptly clean out uneaten food so it doesn't rot.</p><p>Do not feed them meat such as chicken or beef; if they don't encounter the food in the wild, a diamondback terrapin probably won't be able to digest it easily. As turtles go, terrapins are rather messy eaters that will often turn over their food bowls to enjoy eating when and wherever they choose.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>In general, diamondback terrapins stay healthy and parasite-free with proper care. The most significant health problem for a diamondback terrapin is shell rot. Another risk for this species is deformities of either the shell or the eye. All of these can occur when the turtle is under stress, receives poor nutrition, or lives in water that has too little or too much salt.</p><p>To avoid these issues, choose healthy baby diamondback terrapins born in captivity, provide a varied and nutritious diet, and use a ppm (parts per million) concentration of saltwater that mimics the natural origin of the subspecies you have. This information should be provided by the person you buy the terrapin from.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>As with many other reptiles, the female of the terrapin species grows larger than the male. Female shells can reach about 8 inches (approximately the size of an average dinner plate), while males' shells only reach about 5 inches in length.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping a Diamondback Terrapin as a Pet </h2><p>Diamondback terrapins are fun pets to keep and watch as they swim and crawl around their tank. They are also easy to handle and make interesting teaching tools for budding herpetologists. The only drawback to owning these turtles is that they do require specific care in terms of water salinity, temperature, lighting, and feeding. Failure to meet their needs can result in stress, various ailments, and even the death of your pet.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Diamondback Terrapin </h2><p>When buying one or more diamondback terrapins, choose young turtles that are available from reliable turtle breeders. It's also acceptable to buy adult turtles from someone who has taken good care of them and needs to find their pets a new home.</p><p>While it's possible to find diamondback terrapins in the wild, it is not legal to capture them for private ownership. Wild terrapins would not make good pets anyway because they become anxious in confined spaces and don't want to be handled.</p><h2>Similar Species to the Diamondback Terrapin </h2><p>These turtles rarely bite as long as they are handled gently.</p><p>In the wild, terrapins encounter life-threatening hazards, such as predators and habitat destruction by humans, that can shorten their lifespans. In captivity, these turtles can live up to 40 years with proper care.</p><p>In the wild, terrapins tend to live near one another and even hang out in groups when basking on rocks and logs. In captivity, a pet terrapin will appreciate the company of another member of its species as long as the turtles have enough space to not be crowded.</p>",1274
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bearded-dragon-lighting-1238402,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>Lighting For Bearded Dragons</h1>,"<h1>Lighting For Bearded Dragons</h1><h2>When to Use Fluorescent, Halogen, Incandescent Lights, and More</h2><p>As far as lizards go, bearded dragons are one of the most loved species by keepers and enthusiasts. They are relatively easy to keep, but for the lizard to live long in captivity, the lighting and heating must be maintained closely. You will want to make sure that a beardie's enclosure has a source of UVA rays, UVB rays (simulating the sun's helpful rays), heating, and temperature gauges to monitor the heat level.</p><h2>Bearded Dragon's Natural Habitat </h2><p>A bearded dragon's lighting set-up should mimic what the reptile would get in the wild as closely as possible. A natural environment for a bearded dragon is the desert. Beardies in the wild receive ultraviolet light and heat from the sun on a daily basis. In order to best mimic the ultraviolet light in an indoor enclosure, high ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) output light bulbs must be used. Fluorescent bulbs and mercury vapor bulbs are the two sources most commonly used in the pet world.</p><p>In addition to making sure that your beardie gets the right light rays, you also have to make sure that this cold-blooded reptile gets the heat it needs. Reptiles normally rely on the sun's heat to regulate their normal body processes. So, for an indoor enclosure, you will need to think about heating it properly. For heat, your best bets are ceramic heat bulbs or mercury vapor bulbs. Although, there are other sources of heat you can use.</p><h2>Light Placement </h2><p>Before you get the bulbs, you should think about the light fixtures, and where to affix them. Bulbs should be placed within 12 inches of a bearded dragon. It is important to mount it in an appropriate spot. Make sure it is placed on a wire meshsurfaceor hung from the top of the enclosure with nothing between the fixture and the reptile.</p><p>Most fixtures have reflective material on thesidesor are shaped to help direct the light and heat down into the tank. Other fixtures are open with a wire cage around where the bulb goes to heat all around the fixture.</p><h2>Fluorescent Bulbs </h2><p>Aside from direct sunlight (not filtered through a window), there are a couple of different sources that give off invisible ultraviolet rays. Special fluorescent bulbs that fit into fluorescent fixtures give off varying levels of UVA and UVB rays. These full-spectrum bulbs run out of the UV rays before the lights actually burn out, so these need to be replaced per the manufacturer's recommendation, which is usually every six months.</p><p>Bearded dragons need an 8 to 10 percent output of UVB rays, which should be clearly marked on the bulb packaging. These bulbs are to be placed overhead and no more than 12 inches from where your beardie can sit or climb in order to soak in the rays. Make sure the bulb is not placed on a plastic, plexiglass, or glass surface. These types of substances will block the rays from penetrating through to the reptile. Research published in 2007 shows that the typical metal mesh screen commonly used for the tops of reptile tanks may block a significant amount of UVB rays as well, but the jury is still out on this theory.</p><p>You'll probably need a ballast for your full-spectrum fluorescentbulbunless you decide to go with a compact fluorescent bulb. Some of these fixtures are dual-purpose and also have sockets for incandescent or halogen bulbs all mounted on one fixture. These dual-purpose fixtures are ideal for small spaces, but make sure the fixture can handle the heat wattage you need otherwise it might melt the fixture.</p><p>The fluorescent fixture you choose should have a reflector built into it; otherwise,you can just place some aluminum foil to make a reflector inside the fixtureto increasethe number of UV rays that reach your bearded dragon.</p><h2>Mercury Vapor Bulbs </h2><p>Mercury vapor bulbs serve more than one purpose for your bearded dragon. They emit both UVA and UVB rays and provide heat for your enclosure. This is a two-for-one. You can use the one bulb to provide both heat and the important ultraviolet rays in place of the usual two.</p><p>These bulbs last a great deal longer than fluorescent bulbs and heat bulbs, and although they cost more, seeing that they last longer usually makes them worthwhile. Some people even note better appetite, coloration, and energy in their beardies while using mercury vapor bulbs.</p><p>There is some discussion in the reptile community that mercury vapor bulbs can be dangerous to reptiles because of the intensity of the UV rays produced by these bulbs. If you do decide to go with a mercury vapor bulb, be sure to provide plenty of shade opportunities in the enclosure, use a ceramic socket for the bulb, and keep a distance of 12 to 24 inches between your reptile and the bulb for safety reasons. This bulb is best used for large spaces with a lot of room for your beardie to roam.</p><h2>Compact Fluorescent Bulbs</h2><p>These bulbs act the same as fluorescent bulbs, but they can be screwed into incandescent fixtures. These bulbs use less energy than a fluorescent bulb and should last longer, but it's possible the UV may be much too high for reptiles. Be sure to create variety in your bearded dragon's habitat, so that it can regulate UV levels on its own by hiding in shady spots when necessary.</p><h2>Heat Bulbs </h2><p>Unless you have a mercury vapor bulb, you will need additional heat bulbs to give the beardies the heat they need. Temperatures needed vary based on the age of the beardie. Babies need more heat and adults a little less. For example, the range for babies is 90 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit and 80 to 93 degrees F for adults. The hottest spot is the lizard's basking area. Also, beardies need separate zones, so if they start to overheat, they can regulate their body temperature by finding a cooler spot. Temperatures should drop by 10 degrees all-around at night.</p><p>Fluorescent bulbs do not give off enough heat on their own; beardies will need a supplemental heat source if you are using fluorescent lighting.</p><p>Heat bulbs are a safer alternative than heat rocks, which can cause thermal burns. Also, heat bulbs are better thanunder tankheaters, which makes it difficult to regulate the temperature in the enclosure accurately. Some heat bulbs may also give off UVA rays.</p><h2>Ceramic Heat Bulbs </h2><p>Ceramic heat bulbs provide no light to an enclosure, but they do provide heat. Just like regular incandescent light bulbs, they come in different wattages. The wattage needed depends on the size of the enclosure and if any other heat bulbs are used. Unlike regular incandescent bulbs, they last for an extremely long period of time, making them more cost-effective, but they do not deliver ultraviolet rays. So, you will need to make sure you get a full-spectrum fluorescent light. Make sure ceramic heat bulbs are not placed in direct contact with a surface that will melt.</p><h2>Incandescent Heat Bulbs </h2><p>These are your typical heat lights that emit light, UVA rays, and varying wattages of heat. Different bulb sizes and shapes are available, as well as colors of light (wavelengths). Daylight bulbs are regular white lights, nightlight bulbs are blue/purple lights, and nocturnal lights are red (don't use painted bulbs). These bulbs alone do not offer the necessary UVB rays to prevent metabolic bone disease.</p><p>The incandescent fixture is a typical screw-in bulb socket. Most heat lights and ceramic bulbs fit into this type of fixture. Some halogen bulbs are designed to fit into incandescent fixtures as well.</p><p>The wattage needed depends on the size of the enclosure and if any other heat bulbs are used. The size and shape onlymatterfor fitting in your incandescent fixture.</p><p>The shapes of these bulbs usuallyhavea purpose. Basking lights are shaped to direct heat into the area directly below the bulb as opposed to the entiretankand are usually shaded on the sides to assist in directing the light.</p><h2>Halogen Heat Bulbs </h2><p>These bulbs do all the same things as incandescent heat bulbs, and even though they cost a bit more, they emit more heat, light, and UVA rays than an incandescent bulb of the same size. They also usually last longer and use less energy than incandescents, but they still do not offer UVB on their own.</p><p>Some halogen bulbs fit in incandescent fixtures and others fit in halogen fixtures. Make sure your bulbs fit into your fixtures before purchasing them.</p><p>Halogen fixtures are different from fluorescent and incandescent fixtures, so don't try to make a halogen bulb fit intooneunless the packaging specifically says it will fit.</p><h2>Temperature Gauges </h2><p>You need to continuously measure the inside of your enclosure to know if your beardie is getting ample heat. You should have at least two thermometers: one directly under the basking light and one on the ""cool"" side of the enclosure to ensure a properthermal gradient. For largerenclosures,you should have several thermometers placed throughout your bearded dragon's home.</p>",1501
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-care-for-an-african-fat-tailed-gecko-5221035,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>How to Care for an African Fat-Tailed Gecko</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for an African Fat-Tailed Gecko</h1><p>African fat-tailed geckos are often confused with leopard geckos, but they are actually a different type of gecko. African fat-tailed geckos are almost as popular as leopard geckos due to their increased availability and ease of care. If you're interested in these small lizards, knowing what they need to thrive as a pet is of the utmost importance.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s) African fat-tailed gecko</p><p>Scientific Name</p><p>Adult SizeUsually 7-9 inches in length but may be as small as 4 inches or as large as 11 inches</p><p>Lifespan15-20 years in captivity and the wild</p><h2>African Fat-Tailed Gecko Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>African fat-tailed geckos are docile, don't make much noise, and are not known to bite. These small geckos are great for beginner reptile enthusiasts because they don't require much taming to be able to be handled. They are also nocturnal reptiles which means they are active at night and hide during the day from the hot sun.</p><p>African fat-tailed geckos have the ability to drop their tail when they feel threatened. This can be very traumatizing to an unsuspecting gecko owner but is a natural defense mechanism of the lizard. The tail will regrow but won't look quite the same. Avoid holding it too tightly, startling it, or scaring it to help prevent it from dropping its tail. Additionally, never house two males together to avoid territorial fights. Finally, if you see your gecko shaking its tail rapidly, it is getting ready to strike at prey or something else, so keep your hands away from it.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>These lizards are small compared to other pet reptiles. Female African fat-tailed geckos only grow to be around 7 inches long, but males grow to be slightly larger, typically maxing out at around nine inches, including the tail. Some African fat-tailed geckos do get slightly larger though and have been recorded to be nearly 12 inches in length. But the length of these geckos is not what makes them special. Instead, the tail of an African fat-tailed gecko is what sets them apart from other similar geckos since it can grow to be over an inch wide at its widest point. This fat tail is what gave these geckos their name.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>African fat-tailed geckos do not require a lot of space. One or two geckos can happily live in a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium with a mesh or screen top. This type of enclosure will allow for easy cleaning, safe placement of heat lights on the lid, and security from other pets and children that could injure the geckos. Be sure to provide multiple hides, both a dry hide and a humid hide, whether it's a rock cave or half log to sleep in the tank. Temperatures should be around 90 degrees Fahrenheit on the hot end and in the high 70s to low 80s on the cool side of the tank. Humidity should be between 40-60% on average for this species.</p><h2>Specific Substrate Needs </h2><p>Since African fat-tailed geckos are native to Africa, these lizards are found in dry habitats naturally. They don't burrow or climb, so all you need alongside the hide to make them happy is some basic substrate. Paper towels, newspaper, butcher paper, etc. are popular choices, but if you want a more natural look, there are a variety of reptile soils that can also be used. Repticarpet is a great option for safe substrate that is easy to clean and not able to be digested by the lizard when eating its prey. It is recommended to avoid sand though to avoid the opportunity for an impaction to occur.</p><h2>What Do African Fat-Tailed Geckos Eat and Drink? </h2><p>These little geckos are primarily insectivores so crickets, mealworms, waxworms and other easily obtained insects are popular options. These insects should be fed to your African fat-tailed gecko after they have been gut-loaded, and dusting with a reptile calcium powder should be done every other feeding. Talk to your exotic veterinarian about multi-vitamin options for your gecko as this supplement provides essential vitamins and minerals but is given on a daily basis. Adult African fat-tailed geckos should eat about two dozen crickets a week with feedings of eight or nine crickets every other day. Worms can be placed in a shallow dish and left in the tank. A shallow bowl of clean water should always be available.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like other reptiles, if an African fat-tailed gecko isn't properly cared for, a variety of health problems can occur. Metabolic bone disease, dysecdysis (retained shed), malnutrition, and other issues are often seen in geckos that are not receiving proper care. Additionally, intestinal parasites like cryptosporidium, injuries, impaction, and more can occur and may require veterinary attention.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>African fat-tailed geckos require very minimal upkeep costs. The largest expense will be the ongoing food costs, but if you choose to raise your own crickets or mealworms, even that expense will be minimal. Aside from food, lightbulb changes are needed to maintain an appropriate temperature in the tank and keep your gecko warm.</p><h2>Pros and Cons of Keeping an African Fat-Tailed Gecko as a Pet </h2><p>African fat-tailed geckos are nocturnal so they will be most active when most people are sleeping. If you want a pet that will be active during the day, a diurnal species may be a better option. If being nocturnal doesn't bother you though, African-fat tailed geckos are hardy pets for beginner reptile enthusiasts. They don't require fresh veggies be chopped everyday, take up minimal space, and are usually docile. Alternatively, they are fragile lizards due to their small size and have the ability to drop their tail, so adult supervision and careful handling is necessary to keep them safe.</p><h2>Similar Geckos to the African Fat-Tailed Gecko </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other reptiles that can be your new pet!</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your African Fat-Tailed Gecko </h2><p>Some pet stores sell African fat-tailed geckos, but most people purchase them from breeders online or at reptile shows and expos.As these lizards continue to grow in popularity, their availability will increase, but they may also then start showing up at reptile rescues since they may live longer than some people plan expect.</p><p>If you are selecting an African fat-tailed gecko from a breeder, it is always best to personally see the lizard before you purchase it. Your best chance of this happening is usually at a reptile show or expo where numerous breeders are present with multiple reptiles. This way you can ask questions about the gecko and make sure it doesn't have any obvious signs of illness before purchasing it.</p><h2>Reproduction/Breeding </h2><p>If you house a male and female gecko together, they may breed and lay eggs but that doesn't necessarily mean the eggs will be viable and hatch. Special conditions are needed to incubate eggs and extra care will need to be paid to the female to prevent calcium depletion and egg binding. If you want to prevent the potential of eggs and decrease the likelihood of egg-related illnesses in a female but want more than one gecko, opt for two females instead of one male and one female.</p><p>African fat-tailed geckos can make great pets for kids as long as the kids know what to expect. These small geckos are good for kids that can gently hold a lizard and enjoy watching a pet inside a tank. Additionally, they are great for kids with allergies to pets with fur and dander.</p><p>African fat-tailed geckos don't require daily feedings, handling, or even cleaning. They are great for someone who needs a low-maintenance pet without noise and mess. Offering food a few times a week, occasional spot cleaning of the tank, and providing fresh water are the biggest care requirements.</p><p>Prices will vary depending on the color mutation of the African fat-tailed gecko but you can usually expect to pay around $50-$75 for a regular morph. More exotic patterns can cost a couple of hundred dollars and rare patterns can cost nearly $1,000.</p>",1331

When setting up a tank for these species, try to emulate the natural habitat of the particular species of salamander or newt. Once established, continue to ensure the quality of the environment is carefully monitored and maintained.</p><p>There are three general types of tanks for salamanders and newts: terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and aquatic. Individual species may require specific tank needs; speak to a veterinarian or expert to determine the best tank for your pet.</p><h2>Terrestrial (Land) Tank </h2><p>Land tanks are set up to approximate the environment favored by land-dwelling salamanders. This sort of terrarium should provide areas of light and dark, a damp substrate with leaves and or moss, and shelters made from rocks or small logs. Sufficient humidity must be maintained along with damp retreats. Generally, moss can retain enough water to provide the moisture/humidity needs of terrestrial salamanders. Water can also be provided in a shallow container as a water source and to help maintain the humidity. Terrestrial species are not strong swimmers so the water must be shallow. Placing rocks or sticks in the water will help the salamander stay out of trouble (and will also prevent any prey insects such as crickets from drowning). A secure cover should be used; a screened cover helps with ventilation, but the top may need to be partly covered to maintain the necessary humidity.</p><p>The substrate can be a soil and moss combination, or simply peat and sphagnum moss. A layer of gravel can be used to line the bottom of the tank. Some species will use soil for burrowing. Mixing peat moss into the soil will help prevent packing of the soil and also increase its moisture retention ability. Keep in mind when creating the terrarium environment that the substrate will have to be changed as it becomes soiled. The more elaborate the setup, the more difficult cleaning becomes. For larger species or groups of salamanders, you will need to clean the enclosures more frequently.</p><p>Shelters can be created with rocks (make little caves), pieces of clay pots, or pieces of wood or bark. Terrestrial salamanders are fairly secretive and will spend a great deal of time under shelter. Place shelters along the perimeter of the tank so you will be able to observe them through the glass. For very secretive species, black paper taped to the glass will provide the necessary privacy and can be removed briefly to view the salamander.</p><h2>Semi-Aquatic Tanks </h2><p>This type of set up combines terrestrial and aquatic elements, including a land area where the newt can bask with a transition to an aquatic area which can be quite deep. The land area can be set up simply by piling gravel and moss above the water level, but it is easier in the long term to separate the land and water areas with a piece of plastic or plexiglass placed across the aquarium and sealed with aquarium grade silicone sealant.</p><p>It is important to make sure there is an easy transition from the water to land to allow the newt to crawl out. A dense piece of wood (like ironwood, coralwood, or monkey wood) can be placed partly in the water and partly on land to provide the transition. This also provides a nice basking spot. Alternately, gravel can be sloped in the aquatic side to provide a ramp out of the water. In the aquatic portion, the gravel should be large enough not to be swallowed and rounded and smooth to prevent skin damage. This tank requires a secure cover since salamanders and newts can climb surprisingly well.</p><h2>Aquatic Tanks </h2><p>Aquariums are used for aquatic species (such as the axolotl) and provide a bit of a challenge due to the amount of waste salamanders produce and their sensitivity to changes in their environment. Salamanders excrete a good deal of ammonia in their waste. In the wild, this waste is quickly diluted and carried away from the salamander's skin. In an aquarium, the salamander is essentially trapped with its waste. It can be difficult to keep the water clean enough to maintain the salamander's health.</p><p>The first step is to keep the salamander in the largest tank possible; this provides dilution. A good power filter should be used with larger aquatic species; most aquatic salamanders can tolerate fairly strong currents but make sure the current is not too strong. Gravel can be used, but a tank with a bare bottom is easier to maintain and safer. Gravel that is too small may be ingested and with large gravel, food can disappear between the stones. In addition to filtration, frequent (partial) water changes are the best way to maintain water quality.</p><h2>What Kind of Water? </h2><p>Some experts recommend using commercially bottled spring (not distilled) water for housing amphibians. Tap water should always be treated with de-chlorinating tablets or solution or left standing for at least 24 hours before adding to an aquarium. This allows the added chlorine to dissipate. The use of rainwater is acceptable as long as it is checked for appropriate pH since it is often too acidic. Pond water is best avoided; it can be contaminated with pollutants or parasites that can be injurious to captive amphibians.</p><h2>Filters </h2><p>Under gravel filters work well in setups that include gravel since they support beneficial bacteria that convert ammonia to harmless nitrites. This type of filter can also be used in very shallow pools, even in terrestrial terrariums. They also have the advantage of not creating strong currents which can cause problems for smaller species. Because debris is pulled down into the gravel with this system, the gravel will have to be cleaned (e.g. with a gravel washer) regularly.</p><p>There are a variety of other filter types that are also effective. Inside corner filters with external air pumps are a good choice for smaller salamanders since they do not create strong currents and also establish the beneficial ammonia converting bacteria. Whenever a filter is changed, add some used filter material to the new one to speed the colonization of the good bacteria. Some of the stronger filters are probably best reserved for the larger species that won't be stressed by strong water currents.</p><h2>Ammonia </h2><p>Ammonia is a waste product excreted by amphibians (and other animals, particularly aquatic species) that is dangerous if allowed to accumulate in their environment. The best way to prevent the accumulation of ammonia is to use adequate filtration and replace the water. About 20 to 25 percent of the water should be replaced every week or every other week (you may want to get an ammonia test kit to see how fast ammonia levels accumulate). Even if changing from a dirty tank toclean water, do it gradually, as the shock of changing water chemistry can be harmful and never do a full water change.</p><h2>pH and Water Quality </h2><p>Generally speaking, salamanders do best at a pH (the measure of the acidity) of 6.5 to 7.5, in the water and the soil. Ideally, if collecting salamanders from the wild, measure the pH of the soil and water in the area and match that pH in captivity. pH strips give a quick and easy measurement. The environment should be checked periodically as the pH will change over time with waste products and other factors. If you are moving an amphibian to a new environment with a different pH it should be done gradually. If a salamander is stressed due to an incorrect pH it will be restless, moving around in areas it usually does not, and eventually will become lethargic and have decreased muscle tone.</p><h2>Temperature </h2><p>Most salamanders from temperate climates are best kept at fairly low temperatures of 50 to 70 degrees F. Often a basement is a good place to keep salamanders. For some species, cooling may be necessary. Long-term cooling can be difficult (some people rig up methods of running cool water through the tank), and it is probably best to simplytry to set up tanks where the ambient temperature remains cool enough to keep the tanks cool. Air conditioning can be used if necessary. For short-term cooling, you can do frequent 20 to 25 percent water changes with slightly cooler water, float small bottles of ice water in the tank, or even make ice cubes out of treated (dechlorinated) water to add to the tank as necessary in hot weather.</p><p>If supplemental heat is necessary, a submersible heater can be used in the aquatic tanks. Other heating methods such as incandescent lighting, under tank heaters, or other commercial heaters should be used with caution since they can be too drying for amphibians.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>If tanks are kept in the basement, it is best to keep them near a window so that natural seasonal light cycles are maintained. This level of light is fine for most species. If live plants are used in the tank, a full spectrum light source is needed for the plants. It is best to approximate the natural light cycles for that particular salamander. A low wattage fluorescent light is preferred if a light is needed. Most salamanders and newts prefer darker conditions (and the lights should only be on a maximum of 10 to 12 hours per day) and lights can be drying.</p><h2>Cleaning Tips </h2><p>Cleaning is important, but it is necessary to remember the sensitivity of salamanders (and other amphibians) to chemicals in the environment. Unless there is a health problem, hot water can be used to clean aquariums and items in the aquariums. Letting tanks and furnishings dry in the sun is also helpful. New items should be carefully inspected for pests or decaying material, cleaned, and dried before adding to the cage. Rocks and other non-porous items can be soaked in a bleach solution and very thoroughly rinsed. Commercial disinfectants should usually be avoided. It can be difficult to rinse all the residue and it takes very little exposure to some chemicals to seriously harm or kill a salamander. This is especially true for porous materials like wood, as any residues can leach out over time and kill the salamander.</p>",1687

Owning a spiny-tail is a serious commitment because these lizards can live up to 30 years.</p><h2>Spiny-tailed Lizard Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>The spiny-tailed lizard is like a small, gentle reptile that uses its tail to wave off predators in defense. Its scientific genus name, , comes from an ancient Greek word meaning ""tail"" or ""whip.""</p><p>This lizard is a natural burrower in the wild, living in tunnels up to 10 feet long. The reclusive nature of this pet contributes to a rather shy disposition in captivity. Most spiny-tailed lizards will hide when you try to handle them. However, there are a few that will tolerate gentle handling, and some will eat straight out of their owners' hands.</p><p>These lizards have a powerful jaw, and the bite can hurt, but they usually only bite as a defensive mechanism. If handled calmly and with care, without sudden movements, your pet is unlikely to bite you.</p><p>Male spiny-tailed lizards may act aggressively towards other due to their territorial nature. So, either keep one male per group or house it alone.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>A large terrarium or fish tank (40 to 55 gallons) is needed to house a spiny-tailed lizard. A few rocks are also necessary to provide basking, hiding, climbing, and eating spots. You can buy a commercially-produced reptile shelter or create a tower of securely stacked rocks interspersed with a few small logs with crevices in which your lizard can hide. It may be tempting to minimize hiding spaces in order to have more viewing opportunities, but keeping your lizard exposed will cause it stress and result in failing health.</p><p>You will need to remove structures and substrate to deep-clean the lizard's entire enclosure once a month. Between these cleanings, you will need to spot clean or scoop up visible feces to maintain sanitary conditions.</p><h3>Specific Substrate </h3><p>Reptile owners sometimes use substrate or bedding to line the bottom of a cage. Since spiny-tailed lizards are diggers, they will appreciate ample substrate for burrowing.</p><p>Provide 6 to 8 inches of bedding material in the enclosure so that your lizard can instinctively burrow. Natural sand sold as ""washed play sand"" or calcium sand sold in pet stores works well.</p><p>Any substrate that can fit in your lizard's mouth can be accidentally ingested while eating and has the possibility of causing an impacted colon. To avoid this, feed your lizard on a plate covering the substrate, so it cannot swallow bits of sand by mistake.</p><h3>Heat </h3><p>Provide heating with heat lamps. All reptiles regulate their body temperature by moving around their environments, from warm basking spots to cooler crevices. Provide a basking area with a lamp at one end of the tank that remains about 120 degrees; the cooler end of the tank should maintain a temperature around 90 degrees. At night, the enclosure's temperature can drop to replicate its natural desert environment as long as it stays above 70 degrees. For lighting, you can choose a ceramic light, or a blue, red, or white heat light bulb. Make sure you keep a thermometer handy or mount one at each end of the enclosure to regularly monitor the temperature.</p><h3>Light </h3><p>Spiny-tailed lizards need ample UVB exposure provided by a fluorescent or mercury vapor bulb. Purchase bulbs that have at least an eight to 10 percent UVB output (a higher UVB output is excellent, too, and preferred). Keep this bulb on a 12-hour cycle to mimic the sun going up and down.</p><p>Place your light 10 to 12 inches from the spot where your lizard basks. Since mesh screens block a good portion of the light's UVB rays, mount it underneath the screen if possible, just not too close to the basking surface.</p><p>Replace fluorescent bulbs every six months or following the manufacturer's recommendation. Even if the bulb still emits light, the invisible UVB rays stop emitting after six months.</p><h3>Humidity </h3><p>This lizard cannot tolerate high humidity; too much moisture can kill it. The ideal humidity range for the spiny-tailed lizard is no more than 35 percent. This lizard typically burrows deeply to find any moisture it needs, so provide a humid hide or container for it (no more than 65 percent humidity) to simulate its burrow. It may need this humid environment to help it shed its skin. To monitor the moisture level, use a hygrometer or humidity gauge.</p><h2>What Do Spiny-tailed Lizards Eat and Drink? </h2><p>Spiny-tailed lizards are herbivores. They may eat the occasional insect in the wild, but too much animal protein can cause it digestive distress or severe kidney issues, so avoid feeding your lizard insects.</p><p>Feed a variety of dark leafy greens, such as escarole, dandelion greens, endive, collard greens, mustard greens, and spring mixes. For added protein, include lentils, split peas, beans, and millet.</p><p>In the wild, these lizards can go weeks or months without food. Feed hatchlings and juveniles daily, but adults can eat four or five times a week. Feed in the morning, and offer the lizard as much as it will eat. If it refuses to eat, remove the food so that it doesn't rot. On occasion, your spiny-tailed lizard may refuse food for up to a week. These lizards may experience a loss of appetite when feeling stressed, preparing to shed their skin, or falling ill.</p><p>Healthy lizards that are fed a varied diet of veggies and should not need a calcium supplement, but many exotics veterinarians still recommend dusting calcium powder over your lizard's food a couple of times a week.</p><p>A water dish is not necessary since spiny-tails get their water from their food.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is one of the most common illnesses found in pet reptiles, often resulting from calcium and vitamin D deficiency. Signs of MBD include swollen joints, trembling, and a lax jaw. A balanced diet, ample UVB lighting, and calcium supplementation should prevent your lizard from getting MBD.</p><p>Dehydration can also result from an inadequate diet. Since spiny-tailed lizards rely on their food as their source for water, an abundance of leafy greens will prevent dehydration.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>Spiny-tailed lizards measure between 10 and 18 inches, including their tails, as adults. Females are generally larger than males.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Spiny-tailed Lizard </h2><p>Before purchasing a spiny-tailed lizard, search local reputable breeders or sellers that have experience with captively bred spiny-tailed lizards. If you can get your reptile from a breeder, they can account for the health of your pet, and most have hand-raised the lizards so that they are comfortable with human contact. Captive-bred lizards are already accustomed to life in a cage and will startle less when being handled. Do not buy an imported lizard; they are often collected illegally, and poachers are responsible for depleting wild populations.</p><p>You can often find reputable breeders through exotics vets, other reptile owners, and reptile shows. At reptile expos, you can regularly meet breeders as well as shop for lizards and all your supplies in one place. Adult spiny-tailed lizards can cost from $100 to $300. Hatchlings usually cost less since their mortality rate is the highest.</p><p>Signs of a healthy spiny-tailed lizard include smooth skin with no traces of mites (small, reddish-brown spots around the face), clear eyes, a smooth jawline, and a fat, rounded tail.</p><h2>Similar Animals to the Spiny-tailed Lizard </h2><p>These shy lizards are not particularly fond of being touched, but those raised from babies will be more likely to accept petting and holding.</p><p>It's better to feed your lizard on a dish or flat surface above the ground so that it doesn't accidentally ingest sand or other substrate; these materials can cause digestive problems.</p><p>Spiny-tails live in parts of northern Africa, the Middle East, Asia, and India.</p>",1330
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/types-of-reptile-pets-that-are-easy-for-kids-5199608,Reptiles & Amphibians,<h1>Top Six Easiest Pet Reptiles For Kids</h1>,"<h1>Top Six Easiest Pet Reptiles For Kids</h1><p>If allergies keep your family from having a furry pet in your house, and the idea of a bird or fish doesn't excite your your kids, a reptile may be a great option for a pet. Reptiles are quiet, there are many species that don't take up a lot of space, they don't make big messes, and kids can interact with and hold them. But not all types of reptiles make ideal pets for kids. Some reptiles are too large for kids to handle or too dangerous for a child to clean or feed. It's best to find out what kinds of reptiles are easy for kids to handle and care for before you commit to having one live in your home. Here are the six easiest pet reptiles for kids to take care of.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>While some reptiles may be easier for kids to care for than others, adults should still ensure a child's pet reptile is receiving proper care.</p><h2>Leopard Geckos</h2><p>Leopard geckos are very popular with kids and adults for several reasons. They come in a variety of colors, are easy to handle, are not aggressive, have fairly simple habitat requirements, are clean, and can live up to 20 years as pets. Leopard geckos don't need complex habitats, do not require UVB lighting, and eat small insects. They are fun for children to feed and their enclosures can be spot-cleaned by kids in between full cleanings. Leopard geckos are also terrestrial lizards, so they spend a lot of time in their burrows inside their habitats and are easy to find.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 8 to 10 inches including the tail</p><p>Weight: 50-80 grams</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Large eyes, traditionally yellow, black, and white but can come in many morphs. Thick tail almost as long as the body, bumpy but soft skin.</p><h2>Bearded Dragons</h2><p>Larger than a leopard gecko, a bearded dragon will require a little more space and lighting but it is just as docile. Bearded dragons are easy to handle and are hardier than leopard geckos, but they also require fresh veggies on a daily basis. This will put your child to work cutting up dark, leafy greens each day. Otherwise, if your habitat is set-up correctly with the proper heat and lighting, they are easy to maintain.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 16-24 inches including the tail</p><p>Weight: 300-600 grams</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Traditionally sand colored but many different morph colors are available. Spiky, rough skin, triangle-shaped head, long tail.</p><h2>Corn Snakes</h2><p>If your child isn't a lizard fan, then consider a corn snake. This slithering option is docile, easy to handle, comes in a few color options, is quiet, clean, and doesn't even require much in the way of daily attention, feeding, or even lighting. Corn snakes need secure housing to prevent them from escaping, but similar to a leopard gecko, a heat light is really the only other special thing this reptile needs. Adult corn snakes only need to be fed once a week or so, but you and your child will need to be comfortable feeding your pet pre-killed mice that are stored in the freezer.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 3-5 feet</p><p>Weight: 500-900 grams</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Traditionally a red-copper color but available in over 40 morphs, slender, round head.</p><h2>Blue-Tongued Skink</h2><p>One of the best lizards for kids is the blue-tongued skink. It is just as docile, easy to handle, and low-maintenance as the other lizards on this list. Blue-tongued skinks are not aggressive but because they are larger, if a small child accidentally gets bit, it will hurt. Older children may appreciate the larger size of a blue-tongued skink and will enjoy preparing their fresh fruits, vegetables, and insects each day. Like a bearded dragon, with a larger size comes a larger enclosure, and these skinks also require proper heat and lighting.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 24 inches including the tail</p><p>Weight: 280-510 grams</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue tongue, smooth scales, short legs, long body.</p><h2>Ball Pythons</h2><p>Another great snake option for kids is the ball python. This snake will also need to be fed pre-killed mice, but if that doesn't bother you and your child, a ball python is a thicker snake than the corn snake. It may be too heavy for small children to pick up without assistance and ball pythons can live for several decades, so if you don't want to get stuck caring for this snake once your child leaves home, that's something to consider. If, however, you're looking for a long-lived, docile pet reptile, these pythons are a great option.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4-5 feet</p><p>Weight: 1,000-2,000 grams</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Thick-bodied, camouflage colors, black, brown-patterned, triangular head.</p><h2>Russian Tortoises</h2><p>Not every kid is into caring for a slithery reptile, so a tortoise might be more their style. Russian tortoises are extremely docile, slow-moving, quiet, and live a long time. They do require proper heat and lighting as well as fresh veggies on a daily basis, but their size and demeanor are perfect for kids. Plus, they are very hardy so for kids who might still be learning to handle pets gently, Russian tortoises could be a good fit. They come with their own built-in helmets.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4-8 inches</p><p>Weight: 300-1500 grams</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Tan, brown and black markings, low to the ground, rounded carapace.</p><h2>Reptiles to Avoid </h2><p>Aggressive, large, and venomous reptiles should be avoided as pets for kids. Larger constricting snakes, large tortoises, and lizards that are agile and fast are also not good options as they may hurt a child or a child may accidentally hurt them.</p>",898

She is a member of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants. Kayla also works with cats and birds, including falcons and homing pigeons.</p><p>From turtles to snakes,reptiles are surprisingly cuteand fun to care for. Making sure that your scaly friend has the right food to eat is just as important as watching your own diet.</p><p>There are currently estimated to be more than 10,000 different species of reptiles on the face of the planet, from the meat-gobbling crocodile to the lettuce-loving tortoise. There's no such thing as a ""one size fits all"" reptile diet.</p><p>That means it's important to do your research on your pet. Spend time reading about the wild diet of your reptile's species, and then find the appropriate mix of fresh food, pellets, and supplements to keep him healthy for a long life.</p><h2>Different Diets for Different Pet Reptiles </h2><p>Every species of reptile eats a slightly different diet. Let's take a peek at some of the foods that each group of reptiles generally eats.</p><h2>What Do Snakes Eat? </h2><p>Most snakes are carnivores or insectivores. They need to eat meat and don't eat any fruits or vegetables for the most part.</p><p>You'll probably feed your pet snake rodents because they're by far the easiest way to feed a captive reptile. These may be fed at different ages and can be frozen, freshly killed, or alive. Be careful feeding your snake live prey; live prey could attack or injure snakes in some scenarios. If you want to feed your snake live prey, make sure the snake eats the prey; otherwise, remove the live animal from your snake's environment if it doesn't show interest after 10 to 15 minutes.</p><p>Some snakes won't eat food unless it's moving, meaning that there aren't really any options for avoiding rodents if you've got a carnivorous reptile. If you're squeamish about feeding frozen or live mice to your new pet, consider avoiding carnivorous snakes!</p><p>Feeding your carnivorous snake can get expensive quickly if you're not able to raise your own rodents.</p><p>Examples of pet snakes that eat meat includeball pythonsandcorn snakes.</p><h2>What Do Lizards Eat? </h2><p>Lizards are a varied bunch. Most smaller lizards are mostly insectivores. However, other species of lizard can be herbivorous (vegetarian) or omnivorous (both meat and veggies). Some big lizards are true predators, eating larger mammals with easebut those aren't common as pets.</p><p>Insectivorous lizards are probably a better choice if you're comfortable with killing crickets but not rats.</p><p>The specific diet varies a lot depending on the species of lizard. Most people feed their lizards crickets, mealworms, or waxworms.</p><p>It's usually pretty easy to find crickets at your local pet supply store, making it easy to feed these reptiles. That said, if you only feed crickets, your insectivore can develop deficiencies in some nutrients. You may want to explore supplement options.</p><p>Examples of pet insectivorous lizards includeanoles,leopard geckos, and long-tailed skinks.Iguanas, another common pet lizard, are mostly vegetarian. Bearded dragons and blue-tongued skinks are omnivores.</p><h2>What Do Turtles and Tortoises Eat? </h2><p>The pacifists of the reptile world, pet turtles and tortoises usually don't eat any meat or insects.</p><p>Herbivorous turtles and tortoises might be appealing if you don't like the idea of other animals dying to feed your pet. Turtles and tortoises often have complex nutritional needs because they evolved to eat such a variety. Many omnivorous reptiles do best with a vitamin supplement or pellets to augment their fresh meals.</p><p>Common examples of pet turtles are the herbivorousRussian tortoiseand the omnivorous red-eared slider.</p><h2>Does My Reptile Need Supplements? </h2><p>Most pet reptiles eat much less varied food than they would in the wild. For example, we often just feed crickets to our anoles and mice to our corn snakes.</p><p>Even what the mice eat when they're alive is pretty bland, which can reduce their nutritional quality. If the mice always eat nothing but plain old pellets, they're less nutritious for your snake.</p><p>Nutritional deficiencies can lead to weak bones, vulnerability to disease, and a generally shorter life for your pet. Pellets are a great way to augment your reptile's diet, especially for herbivores and omnivores. These balanced diets go a long way to making your reptile more healthy. Even with a mix of pellets and fresh food, many pet reptiles benefit fromor even needsupplements.</p><p>Which supplements your reptile needs will vary greatly based on what you feed and what species it is.</p><p>Some reptile owners feed their crickets and mice a supplemented diet, dust their crickets with supplement powder, or sprinkle supplement powder onto fruits and veggies. You can even add supplements to water for some reptiles.</p><p>In short, there are a lot of different ways to ensure that your reptile gets the diet it needs. The most important thing is knowing your species and doing your research to provide it with the best diet possible.</p><p>Metabolic and Endocrine Diseases of Reptiles.</p>",817

Different kinds of bedding offer different risks and benefits. Depending on what kind of reptile you care for you may need to take some of these things into consideration. Here are some common options for reptile bedding or substrate.</p><h2>Wood </h2><p>Bedding made from wood comes in different forms, sizes, types, and even colors. The most common types of wood used to make bedding are pine, cedar, Douglas fir, aspen, and cypress. It can come in the form of shavings, pellets, and chips. Veterinarians warn away from using pine and cedar as the smell can irritate the respiratory tracts of the animals living in it.</p><p>Wood beddings are best for arboreal species of reptiles, or ones that don't spend much of their time on the ground. Some concerns with shavings, pellets, and bark chips are the lack of absorbency, odor control, fleas/mites in the shavings, and that shavings can hurt the feet of some reptiles or even cause splinters.</p><p>Some companies dye their shavings different colors or infuse them with chlorophyll. Besides staining the reptile the color of the bedding, these don't do much for odor control or absorbency.</p><h2>Recycled Paper Bedding </h2><p>This type of bedding isn't always marketed to the reptile community, but many owners like the absorbency the small pellets and soft pieces of recycled paper have. It isn't a natural type of bedding for reptiles, but some reptiles like to burrow under the soft paper pieces.</p><h2>Coconut Fiber </h2><p>The stringy fiber pieces, also known as the husk, on a coconut are a different choice for reptile bedding. They are often sold in expandable chunks or bricks and are popular among owners of reptiles requiring high humidity. The gardening industry also sells a variety, but it often has fertilizer in it that can harm reptiles.</p><p>Odor control and absorbency are good, and burrowing reptiles especially enjoy coconut fiber.</p><h2>Alfalfa Meal </h2><p>Alfalfa meal is ground up alfalfa hay, which is then compressed into small cylindrical pellets.</p><p>These pellets are quite absorbent, and some manufacturers add reptile-safe germ control agents to the meal. The pellets are also biodegradable, help with odor control, and should be fairly safe if accidentally ingested.</p><h2>Paper Towels and Newspapers </h2><p>These are possibly the most inexpensive types of bedding. Some owners shred the towels and newspapers to create a ""fluffier"" type of bedding, which is good for burrowers, and others just put sheets down on the bottom of the enclosure.</p><p>Paper towels and newspapers are absorbent but do nothing for odor control. Owners like the availability, cost, ease of clean-ups, and lack of possible ingestion. It is obviously very unnatural for any reptile but otherwise presents no large problems.</p><h2>Reptile Carpet </h2><p>Exo Terra</p><p>Colors and textures vary, but most carpets are washable. This is the main draw to reptile carpeting. Some stores will cut carpets to match tank sizes, while others are pre-cut and sold for specific enclosure measurements.</p><p>There is no risk of ingestion, and being able to wash them keeps the enclosure sanitary.</p><h2>Vermiculite </h2><p>Vermiculite is a mineral that is used in many different ways. For reptile bedding, vermiculite is processed by heating it. When water is added, it separates into many layers and expands into long worm-like pieces.</p><p>This type of bedding is great for high humidity reptiles and burrowers. It is an alternative to peat moss.</p><h2>Moss </h2><p>There are a few different moss varieties used as bedding for reptiles, all of which are good for those preferring high humidity or burrowing. This is a natural substrate like sand.</p><h2>Ground Walnut Shells </h2><p>As the name says, this substrate is made of finely ground walnut shells. It can cause impaction, does not hold water, and has no odor control. It is easily scooped like cat litter to dispose of waste and does not clump like sand bedding.</p><h2>Sand </h2><p>Play sand, vitamin-infused sand, and digestible calcium sand are available to reptile owners. Possible ingestion is the biggest concern for reptiles who eat where they live. Digestible calcium sand is okay to digest if it is in small amounts, but obviously, if a reptile were to get a mouth full of any of these types of sand, impaction would occur.</p><p>Sand that is dyed will usually stain the reptile, but the dye will not harm their skin.</p><p>Owners like sand for desert species of reptiles. It is a natural substrate, and if ingestion is not a concern, the sand does not present any other major problems.</p><p>Sand does clump when wet, sticks to wet feet, and does not help with odor control, but some reptiles, such as the sand boa, need sand to burrow.</p>",767

And it's not often that lizards and crocodiles grace the pages of annual calendars, right?</p><p>Despite the fact that they're scaly, slithery and, often, love to eat bugs, reptiles can actually be pretty darn cute! Don't believe us? Check out these reptiles that will instantly make your terrarium cuter.</p><h2>Garter Snakes </h2><p>Snakes. Most people are terrified of them (because they were a threat to our early ancestors and the way they move is just unnatural to us, according to some theories). Indiana Jones seriously just does not want to deal with them. And cats will absolutely lose it if they come across a snake (or anything remotely resembling a snake, like cucumbers). But tiny and non-threatening snakeslike garter snakesare actually kind of cute.</p><p>Widely available in pet stores and suppliers all over America, garter snakes are some of the most commonly kept snakes in the country. And although they're constrictors, their small size will prevent them from destroying the plants and structures in their tanks.</p><h2>Box Turtles </h2><p>They carry their homes on their backs, can live for up to 50 years and make excellent protagonists in childhood fables (okay, it was a tortoise, but still). And despite their sharp beaks, rough, scaly skin and tiny, pointed claws, a box turtle can make a pretty darn cute addition to your terrarium.</p><p>Although they can be a little bit more difficult to care for, box turtles make some cute andseriously long-term reptilian companions.</p><h2>Crested Gecko </h2><p>Despite their bulging eyes and preferred diet of crickets, mealworms, and waxworms, the crested gecko'sgoofy smile and tiny little hands (just look at them! They're so !) make them some of the cutest reptiles that can be kept as pets.</p><p>Crested geckos were thought to be extinct, but were ""rediscovered"" back in 1994. Since then, their low maintenance care and funny personalities have made them extremely popular pets. Because they're super simple to care for, crested geckos make excellent pets for kiddos or beginner reptile pet parents.</p><h2>Chameleons </h2><p>Did you know chameleons actually change color to blend into their environments? Rather, their colors can change from emotional responses (like fear or anger) or changes in the environment, like increased or decreased light, humidity and temperature.</p><p>And although there are 180 species of chameleons in the wild, only a few can be kept as petsand they require a good bit of work. Unfortunately, chameleons aren't the best pick for the novice lizard owner, but if you've got the experience, they can make gorgeous (and fascinating) additions to the terrarium.</p><h2>Worm Lizards </h2><p>What do you get when you combine a creepy, slimy worm with a scaly, bug-eating lizard? The world's scariest creature? No way! More like a weirdly cute reptile that looks like they're straight outtathe Kevin Bacon classic. But way less dangerous and blood-thirsty.</p><p>Found only ina few parts ofFlorida, worm lizards are very similar to earthwormsthey burrow in the soil and have segmented bodiesbut they're actually part of the reptile group Amphisbaenia.</p><h2>Leopard Geckos </h2><p>What's tiny, spotted all over and your new favorite reptile? Leopard geckos! These exotic-looking guys love to nom on crickets and mealworms and bask in direct lightin fact, they need about 12 hours of visible light every day. And when properly cared for, leopard geckos can live up to a whopping 20 years.</p><p>Generally docile and easy to tame, leopard geckos make perfect picks for beginners.</p><h2>Softshell Turtles </h2><p>There are a few reasons we love softshell turtles: Their, ahem, interesting appearance is like a cross between an extraterrestrial being and a video game character, their snouts look like tiny snorkels and they're often referred to aswait for it!</p><p>Softshell turtles differ from regular turtles becauseyou guessed itthey don't have hard exterior shells. And because their shells aren't as hardy and resistant to bacteria, softshell turtles in captivity can often have some shell issues. You can avoid these problems by cleaning the water in your tank often and exposing their shells to natural sunlight or artificial full-spectrum lightit's believed that light exposure can help keep harmful bacteria at bay.</p><h2>Corn Snakes </h2><p>Okay, corn snakes may constrict their prey into submission and love eating mice, but their calm nature, reluctance to bite and manageable size make them a super popular pet in the United States. Their cute littlesmiles don't hurt, either.</p><p>If you've never had a pet snake before, you might want to consider a corn snake. They're pretty low maintenance and don't grow into large adults.</p>",751
10,https://www.thesprucepets.com/red-eared-slider-care-tank-and-supplies-1238360,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>How to Set Up a Tank for a Red-Eared Slider Turtle</h1>,"<h1>How to Set Up a Tank for a Red-Eared Slider Turtle</h1><h2>These semi-aquatic turtles need a basking area for health reasons</h2><p>In their natural habitats, red-eared slider turtles are semi-aquatic turtles, meaning they spend a good deal of their time in the water, but also spend a significant amount of time basking in the sun. While this basking may look like the turtle is just lounging around, it's actually important for the animal's health.</p><p>When kept as a pet, a red-eared slider needs a tank that is large enough to provide both water for swimming and an area where it can dry off and enjoy the sun. When cared for properly in the right tank environment, red-eared sliders can live a long time (over 30 years!) and be very entertaining pets.</p><h2>Before You Begin </h2><p>Plan on a tank size of 10 gallons of water per inch of the turtle as a general rule of thumb, with a minimum size of a 20-gallon for hatchling red-eared sliders. Keep in mind that red-eared sliders can grow to be 10 to 12 inches as adults, so it's likely that you'll eventually need a very large tank.</p><h2>What You Need </h2><p>Large plastic containers or storage tubs are good alternatives to aquariums as long as you don't mind being unable to view the turtles from the side. You won't need a lid if the container is tall enough and the basking area is positioned so that the turtles can't climb out.</p><h2>Fill the Tank With Water </h2><p>Red-eared sliders need an adequate amount of water in which to swim. At a minimum, the water should be about twice as deep as your turtle is longa 4-inch turtle should have a minimum water depth of 6-8 inches.</p><p>Red-eared sliders are strong swimmers, so you don't need to worry about drowning as long as the turtle can get out of the water and there is no place it can get trapped underwater.</p><h2>Create a Basking Area </h2><p>The basking area for your turtle can be provided by stacking smooth rocks and sloping large smooth gravel to one side to make a land area. You could also use wood or a plastic ""turtle dock."" Whatever you choose to construct a basking spot, make sure your turtle can climb onto it easilyand that it allows your turtle to completely dry off.</p><h2>Add Tank Decorations </h2><p>When designing a tank, it's a good idea to keep it uncluttered and easy to clean. Rememberthat turtles can knock things over and push stuff around. Plants may be a nice aesthetic touch, but turtles are likely to make a snack of them or uproot them. Plastic plants will likely be dug up and just make cleaning more difficult.</p><p>The best tank accessories for a red-eared slider are larger rocks and stones, and driftwood. If using driftwood, make sure to purchase it from a pet supplies store rather than using driftwood you find on the beach. The kind sold in the store is parasite-free and will not harm your turtle.</p><h2>Maintain Tank Heat </h2><p>The water in a red-eared slider turtle tank should be kept at about 74-78 degrees Fahrenheit, and up to 80 F for hatchlings. The daytime ambient air temperature in the tank should be between 75 and 80 degrees Fahrenheit, with a basking spot between 90 and 95 F over the land area of the tank. The basking spot lighting can be turned off at night and the air temperature can drop down to as low as 60 F.</p><p>A submersible aquarium waterheater can be used to keep the water warm if necessary. Glass aquarium heaters may become damaged by large turtles and could cause a potentially lethal situation if it heats up the water up too much.</p><p>You can protect the heater so the turtles can't bump it by placing it behind something (a brick is one idea) or by fashioning some sort of cover (a piece of PVC pipe could be used). Be sure to install a good aquarium thermometer and monitor the water temperature.</p><p>Provide a reptile heat lamp over the basking area to keep your turtle warm when it gets out of the water. A reptile bulb/heat lamp in a reflective lamp can serve this purpose, but make sure there's no way the turtle can touch the light or that the light can fall into the water. Use a thermometer to check the surface of the basking site to be sure it is reaching the correct temperature. The basking light will help heat the air in the tank as well.</p><h2>Install an Ultraviolet Light </h2><p>In addition to the basking light for heat, provide a full spectrum reptile Ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light. Exposure to UVA/UVB is necessary for proper calcium metabolism and also appears to have other benefits to overall health such as improving appetite. It is also nice to take your turtle out into the natural sunlight in warmer weather if you can. Just be sure it can't escape or become overheated when in the sun!</p><p>Get a proper reptile UVA/UVB bulb and follow the manufacturer's guide regarding the placement of the bulb. UV rays diminish with distance from the bulb, so it's important to place the bulb where the turtle can be close to benefit best. Replace the bulb as recommended by the manufacturer, since the intensity of UV produced diminishes over time. If your turtle lives outside, this light is not necessary.</p><h2>Cleaning the Tank </h2><p>Between feeding and defecating, turtles are pretty messy creatures. Yourturtle tankshould include a good filtration system such as a power filter or canister filter to keep the water clean. Choose a filter rated for at least double the volume of water you will be filtering since turtles are such messy pets. Filtration will reduce the frequency of water changes but your turtles will still require 25 percent water changes weekly and a thorough cleaning once a month or more.</p><h2>Preventing Problems During Tank Setup </h2><p>Avoiding common problems during tank setup will help your turtle stay healthy and prevent issues in the future.</p><p>First, you need to set aside your turtle in a safe place and then deconstruct its tank, taking all of the pieces out to scrub them clean. It's important to note that you use soap or detergent in your red-eared slider's tank. No matter how much you rinse afterward, it can leave a residue. If you need cleaning products, betadine or methylene blue can do the trick.</p><p>Once everything has been scrubbed clean, it can be placed back in the tank and your turtle can be returned.</p><p>Red-eared sliders can live with tetra fish, zebrafish, guppies, goldfish, minnows, and koi.</p><p>There are a lot of plants you can have in your tank: water hyacinth, hornwort, common waterweed, hornwort, moneywort, dwarf hair grass, java moss, java fern, anacharis, and anubias, to name a few.</p>",1126
11,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-aquatic-turtles-1237254,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>All About Keeping Pet Aquatic Turtles</h1>,"<h1>All About Keeping Pet Aquatic Turtles</h1><p>Aquatic and semi-aquatic turtles are popular as pets. The best-known species is probably the red-eared slider, but it's only one of several species of aquatic turtle that are commonly kept as pets.</p><p>Many people do not realize how bigaquatic turtlescan get.Red-eared sliders, yellow-bellied sliders, and a couple of other commonly available pet turtle species will grow to 1012 inches long and therefore require correspondingly large enclosures.</p><p>All turtles have the potential to enjoy a very long lifespan that can span several decadesif cared for properly.</p><h2>Behavior and Temperament of Aquatic Turtles </h2><p>Beyond providing a proper environment and diet for aquatic turtles, they do not need a lot of attention, although regular interaction may result in a tame and sociable turtle, especially with map turtles. In any case, they are lovely and if properly cared for, they should provide years of enjoyment.</p><p>In 1975, the US government madethe connectionbetween turtles andSalmonellainfections, especially in children, andbanned the sale of turtles shorterthan fourinches long. The reasoning behind this ban was not that baby turtles carry more than the larger ones butthat children are more likely to handle smaller turtles or put them in their mouths.</p><p>Aquatic turtles need large tanks, special lighting, good filtration, and regular cleaning.</p><h2>Aquatic Turtles and Children </h2><p>Aquatic turtles are not ideal pets for children. They are not easy to care for, not great as a pet to handle, and they often harbor bacteria, which can be passed on to children who don't understand the need for good hygiene (such as hand washing).</p><p>Younger children do not have the interest or ability to provide the amount of care and cleaning that an aquatic turtle requires, so parents must realize that the responsibility of caring for the pet ultimately falls onthem when or if their kids lose interest.</p><h2>Housing Aquatic Turtles </h2><p>Aquatic turtles require fairly elaborate housing. They need regular exposure to ultraviolet (UV) light, so special light bulbs designed for reptiles that produce both UVA and UVB light should be in allturtle tanks. Without this light, they can suffer frommetabolic bone disease (soft shell syndrome). Be sure to change the bulb according to the product; most UVB bulbs still turn on after 6 months but stop emitting UVB rays at that point.</p><p>Aquatic turtles are also messy, so their tanks need regular cleanings (partial and full water changes) and, above all,a good filtration unit to help maintain appropriatewater quality. They should have deep enough water to allow for swimming, along with a place to get out of the water to bask under a heat light.Appropriate water and ambient temperatures should be maintained at all times.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Although aquatic turtle foods have changed for the better over the years, they are not recommended as the sole source of food. Mostaquatic turtles are omnivores, although their preferences for certain foods might change over the course of their life, and offering a variety of foods is the best way to feed them.</p><p>Leafy greens such as romaine lettuce, dandelion greens and parsley (fresh, not dried) are fine snacks for aquatic turtles. Since they're submerged in water most of the time, the best way to feed greens to your turtle is either placing the food directly in the water or using a suction cup clip to allow the food to stay in the tank but not float in the water.</p><p>Chopped apples and frozen shrimp can be given to an aquatic turtle as an occasional treat, but are not ideal for everyday meals. Some varieties of aquatic turtles eat insects as well, but the main portion of their diets should come from plants.</p><p>Turtles are messy eaters, so as a rule, feeding aquatic turtles in a separate container from their home tank will allow the mess associated with feeding to be contained. It also allows owners to monitor each turtle's food intake when multiple turtles live together.</p><h2>Choosing Your Aquatic Turtle </h2><p>Given the right person and the right commitment, turtles make beautiful, fascinating, and enjoyable pets. The first steps to good aquatic turtle ownership are to research the species available and the care required of each species.</p><p>While the basics of aquatic turtle care are similar for all species, potential owners need to review the specific details regarding housing and feeding for the particular species they want prior to purchase.</p><p>For beginners, the hardier species of aquatic turtles are recommended, such as red-eared sliders, cooters, mud, and musk turtles. Keep in mind that sliders and cooters will reach a mature length of more than 12 inches, while mud and musk turtles are about half that size.</p><p>Map and painted turtles, as well as some of the less common species, are a bit less hardy as pets. Softshell and snapping turtles have a reputation for being large, aggressive, and generally more difficult to care for, which means they are not good choices for beginners.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Pet turtles have been popular for a long time. Baby red-eared sliders were readily available and inexpensive many years ago, which unfortunately resulted in a lot of neglected turtles.</p><p>Roundworms and other internal parasites are frequently found in turtles and don't usually show obvious symptoms. An exam by a reptile veterinarian is usually when these are discovered.</p><p>Vitamin A deficiency is also a common ailment among turtles. The symptoms may include abscesses in the ears which produce swelling behind the turtle's eye. It can even appear as puffy eyes as well. Make sure your turtle is getting a vitamin supplement from a reputable source to avoid these problems.</p><p>Respiratory infections, which are characterized by wheezing, nasal discharge or bubbling, difficulty breathing (open-mouth breathing), and lethargy are also found in most reptiles, and turtles are no exception.</p><p>Among aquatic turtles, shell rot is a common ailment. This usually occurs when the turtle has a bacterial or fungal infection, many of which can cause ulcers across the shell. This is particularly painful for the animal, as the shell protects its internal organs. Make sure your water quality is good to help avoid these infections.</p><p>These types of infections usually occur after a turtle has been in poor husbandry, injured, or has been under a great amount of stress.</p><p>All of these health issues should receive treatment from a veterinarian who specializes in reptiles, ideally one with expertise in turtles.</p>",1090
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/healthy-red-eared-slider-1238381,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Choosing a Healthy Red Eared Slider</h1>,"<h1>Choosing a Healthy Red Eared Slider</h1><p>Reptiles in the pet trade are prone to being very stressed and sometimes ill. There are some specific things to watch out for when choosing a pet red-eared slider to help ensure your turtle isn't sick before you even get it home. The following tips should help you assess the level of stress and health in a potential pet red-eared slider.</p><h2>Assess Turtle Demeanor and Movements </h2><p>Assess the red-eared slider's demeanor. Red-eared sliders should appear bright, alert and responsive. When you pick up a turtle it will most likely pull its legs into its shell. If a turtle appears lethargic and not responsive it is most likely ill and weak (turtles kept in cool conditions will be slow and lethargic as a result but be careful since these reptiles may also be stressed or ill due to improper environmental conditions).</p><p>Watch the red-eared sliders move. Movements (on land or in water) should be strong and smooth. Weakness or shakiness can be a sign of illness and twitches or tremors may indicate the presence of metabolic bone disease.</p><h2>Look at the Shell and Skin </h2><p>Look at the overall body condition of the turtle. Red-eared sliders should be full-bodied and when you pick them up they shouldn't feel like an empty shell. On the other hand, they should not have rolls of skin and fat around their legs, either. Their shells should be intact and smooth.</p><p>Look at the skin and shell more closely. The skin should be supple and free of bites and scratches (these could form abscesses later on). While a bit of loose skin may hang off during shedding, the skin should look normal and not irritated where it shed. Turtles should have hard, smooth shells with no defects. Sores, cuts, or abrasions on the shell could become infected while soft shells are a sign of metabolic bone disease. Also, avoid any turtles with cracked or broken shells since these injuries are extremely serious.</p><h2>Inspect the Head: Eyes, Nostrils, and Mouth </h2><p>Check the eyes. They should be open, clean, clear, and free of discharge or crusted material. Swollen eyes or eyes that are continually held shut are signs of illness in red-eared sliders and other turtles. Look for signs of respiratory disease including discharge or mucous from the eyes or nose, open-mouthed breathing, or a clicking, wheezing, or bubbly sounds when the turtle breathes. Lopsided swimming is also a sign of respiratory infections in red-eared sliders.</p><p>Check the mouth. The inside of most reptiles mouths are a healthy pink color and are smooth. A pale pink or grey color in the mouth, or the presence of small yellow, white or green patches on the tongue or inside of a turtle's mouth are signs of illness and/or mouth rot. Also be wary if the saliva is stringy or thick.</p><p>Check the rest of the head for any swelling or asymmetry (both sides of the head and jaw should look the same). Swelling or asymmetry of the jaws is can be an indicator of metabolic bone disease. Other lumps or swellings may be abscesses or indicate the presence of general infections or illness.</p><h2>Check Sanitation of Tank </h2><p>Check for overall cleanliness in the red-eared slider tank where you are looking at purchasing a turtle. Turtles kept in crowded or unsanitary conditions may be stressed and more prone to illness.</p><p>Even if a red-eared slider appears to be in good condition but is kept under poor conditions (improper temperatures or lighting, overcrowding, dirty tank, etc.), then be wary. The stress of improper care may make the reptile susceptible to illnesses that might not be apparent until later when you have the turtle at home.</p><h2>Additional Selection Tips </h2><p>Always try to find a captive bred red-eared slider. Wild caught reptiles are likely to be extremely stressed and possibly ill as a result (they tend to be carrying a high parasite load at the very least). Even better, try to find a red-eared slider at a rescue or shelter.</p><h3>Avoid Ill Rescue Turtles </h3><p>Avoid the temptation to ""rescue"" a red eared slider that is clearly ill or being looked after improperly at a shop. While it is a noble thing to do, consider that the one you buy will probably just be replaced with another that will be stressed and/or neglected in the same way. That is in addition to the cost of you providing health care to the rescued reptile and the potential heartache if your rescue dies. Do, however, consider reporting the seller to a local animal welfare authority.</p><h3>Have a Set-Up Prepared </h3><p>Have everything you need set up completely at home before getting a red-eared slider. Going to a new environment is stressful enough and you don't want to be fiddling with setting up a tank and getting temperatures right after bringing your turtle home. Have everything ready and ""perfect"" for the new arrival. This means you'll need to thoroughly research the needs of your pet well before you buy them and avoid impulse purchases.</p><h3>Research Proper Turtle Care </h3><p>Knowing about the proper care of red-eared sliders before you go shopping makes it possible to evaluate how well the reptile is being cared for by the seller.</p>",862
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/painted-turtles-1238355,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>Painted Turtles as Pets</h1>,"<h1>Painted Turtles as Pets</h1><p>Painted turtles are named as such because of their ornate shell markings, but they may also be known as , the Eastern painted turtle, the Southern painted turtle, the midland painted turtle, or the Western painted turtle. Regardless of what you call them though, painted turtles require special attention paid to their water quality, enclosure temperatures, and the food they are fed in order to provide optimal care to these aquatic turtles.</p><h2>About Painted Turtles </h2><p>The average painted turtle grows to be between four and 12 inches long with males being smaller than females. In the wild, painted turtles can live to be over 50 years old and are found in ponds and around small lakes, often congregating on logs to sun themselves and dry off. In colder weather, they will hibernate.</p><p>Like other aquatic turtles, such as map turtles and red-eared sliders, painted turtles are not ideal for households with small children or immune-compromised individuals. Salmonella is something all reptiles can harbor and everyone should wash their hands before and after handling any aquatic turtle.</p><h2>Housing Painted Turtles </h2><p>Since painted turtles are aquatic turtles, they will spend the majority of their time swimming and the rest of their time eating and basking on a dry piece of land in the sun. The care of painted turtles is similar to that of a pet fish in that they need a tank almost entirely filled with water but unlike a fish, they also need somewhere to dry dock. A large fish tank that will hold 100 gallons of water or more is necessary for a full-grown painted turtle, but some turtle owners will also use a kiddie pool, pond liner, or other large plastic containers.</p><p>Gravel built up with larger rocks to create a beach on one side of the tank serves well as a basking area and dry-docking station for your turtle. You can also use a variety of floating accessories that are available at pet stores.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Painted turtles typically eat their food while swimming, so items that float or that can be clipped to the side of the enclosure are best. Aquatic turtle pellets are a good staple diet, but your turtle should also get some fresh leafy vegetables. Dark, leafy greens like romaine, dandelion greens and fresh parsley should be offered on a regular basis. These can be placed in the water or clipped to the side of the tank with a suction cup clip sold in the fish department at the pet store.</p><p>Fresh, chopped apple pieces and freeze-dried shrimp can be offered as treats from time to time, but should not make up more than 10 percent of your turtle's diet. Painted turtles will also eat some insectsand fish. Fatty fish like goldfish should be avoided, but an occasional guppy, cricket, or worm can be offered for variety.</p><p>It should go without saying that water quality is very important to animals that spend the majority of their lives swimming, and aquatic turtles are no exception. Dirty water can cause a number of health problems for an aquatic turtle.</p><p>Quality water filters are a must for any painted turtle enclosure to keep the water clean, clear, and fresh. Submersible filters and canister filters are both good options and should be constantly running to not only provide filtration but also aeration to your painted turtle's water.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>If housed indoors, UVB lighting and supplemental heat lights should be provided to aquatic turtles. Painted turtles don't need extremely warm temperatures, but they will be more active and eat better if their home is heated properly. If temperatures are allowed to drop below 70 degrees, your turtle may become lethargic, not eat well, and start to go into hibernation. Turtles that are housed outside in warmer months should be brought inside when the outside temperature gets too cool.</p><p>UVB lighting should be provided for 12 hours a day, regardless of the season, in the form of a UVB bulb. This bulb should also be replaced every six months since the invisible UVB rays expire before the visible white light does. Painted turtles that are housed outside do not need this supplemental UVB light since they receive natural UVB rays from the sun.</p><p>Heat can be provided in the form of heat lights or ceramic heat emitters. A temperature gradient should be created so your turtle has temperatures between 70 and 95 degrees to choose from. The warmest side of the tank should be the same side as the basking or dry dock area.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Painted turtles are relatively easy to care for with the proper setup and diet but they are not immune to health issues.</p><p>If you suspect your turtle has a health issue get him in to see a vet as soon as possible. With your help, your turtle can live a long and healthy life.</p>",821

They should be getting out of the water and drying off on a regular basis. If your turtle is not doing this, you need to look at your tank set up to make sure basking is inviting to your slider.</p><p>Red-eared sliders need to bask for a number of reasons, and it serves many purposes (besides feeling good). Basking essentially means drying out and absorbing the UV rays of the sun (or bulb). It's something turtles do in their natural habitat every day (conditions permitting) and need to do in captivity.</p><h2>Ideal Conditions </h2><p>Make sure you have provided appropriate basking areas as well as a good temperature differential to entice your red-eared slider to bask. The ideal temperatures of the water in the tank should be 75 to 78 degrees Fahrenheitfor adults and 78 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit for hatchlings. The basking spot should be considerably warmer, at 90 to 95 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><p>If the temperatures (water or basking) are too low, turtles will be sluggish and may not bask. The difference in temperature between the water and the basking spot is also very important, and it's that differential that entices them to bask. If the water is much warmer than recommended or the ambient air temperature is too cool, the turtles will be unlikely to get out of the water to bask.</p><p>Basking is essential for the turtle's health. It allows the turtle to completely dry out and warm up. This makes it more difficult for fungal infections to develop because fungus needs moisture to grow. These types of infections are common health conditions for red-eared sliders. It's also a natural behavior that they are born with. If they live in an environment where they cannot bask, they will likely get stressed, which can cause a number of other health conditions.</p><h2>What You Need </h2><p>The basking area should be nice and dry, stable, and easy to climb onto.</p><p>The turtle needs to get out of the water and onto the basking spot easily enough; this is especially crucial with hatchlings. To create the basking area within the tank, make an easily accessible sloped area where the turtle can climb out of the water to bask. This can be an area elevated above the water using rocks or logs or can be a turtle raft that is sold commercially.</p><p>The goal is to create a spot that is partially submerged or has a ramp to allow the turtle to climb out of the water. This spot should be about 10 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than water temperatures to entice basking. Be careful, though: an area that is too hot won't promote basking and may even put the turtle at risk of hyperthermia or burns on its shell. Offering food before turtles bask will let them digest more easily and could be a treat to encourage basking.</p><p>Red-eared sliders don't like to be bothered when they're basking. If you interrupt them, they might become startled or begin begging for food. Consider covering the sides of the tank to encourage basking.</p><h2>UV Light Positioning </h2><p>Place the heat light over the basking area so the turtle can take full advantage of its heat. Position the light out of reach and not so close that it can burn your turtles, especially if you have a few turtles that stack on top of each other to get closer to the light. Make sure that the bulb can't get wet if the turtles splash; the bulb can shatter when wet, posing a hazard. Leave the heat light on for 10-12 hours during the day. It should be shut off at night to allow the turtle to sleep. It is okay for the turtle tank to cool down at night.</p><p>UVB light is not for heat production but so the turtle can produce vitamin D3 to allow absorption of calcium from the diet.It is necessary in addition to the heat lamp and can also be placed over the basking area and left on during the day.</p><h2>Preventing Problems </h2><p>Do not treat homemade platforms with any chemicals, and don't allow the metal to rust.Even platforms that are natural or organic can alter the water. The basking platform should be secure and not be prone to movement or dismantling. Make sure your turtle can't wedge itself between the basking area and the tank walls or use the spot to escape.</p><p>Double-check the temperatures of both the water and the basking area and try to set up privacy screens and or rearrange the tank set up. With a new look and feel to their tank, you may solve a problem you didn't know existed. If your red-eared slider is still not basking, it may be time to speak with the vet.</p>",804

She is a member of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants. Kayla also works with cats and birds, including falcons and homing pigeons.</p><p>It's no secret that turtles are known to live longer lives than many other pets. Some species of tortoises can live 100 years or more. Several common species of pet water turtles can live into their 40s, though there are many factors that will influence how long your pet turtle lives. Your turtle's lifespan depends on its species, its diet and other aspects of its environment that you can control.</p><p>The bottom line is that most turtles will easily live at least a few decades if they survive past the first few years of life.</p><h2>Determining Your Turtle's Lifespan </h2><p>If you're hoping to know your turtle's potential lifespan, first identify the species of your turtle. Red-eared sliders if cared for properly are likely to survive into their 30s. Tortoises can easily live past their 50s and even into their 80s, which means it's quite possible that your turtle or tortoise will outlive you. Time to draw up that will! (No, seriously.)</p><p>Larger turtles and tortoises can live extremely long lives. The smaller species that are more common as pets are shorter-lived but still may survive several decades. There are many records of tortoises that have lived nearly 200 years (or even more). It's hard to verify these claims because the tortoises obviously outlived their owners. Adwaita, an Aldabra giant tortoise, is probably the longest-living tortoise on record. Adwaita lived in a zoo in India and died at the age of 255 if claims are to be believed. These dates haven't been verified.</p><p>Other famously long-lived tortoises include Timothy, who died at the age of 160; Harriet, a Galapagos giant tortoise who died at the age of 175; Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise who died at age 187; and Tu'i Malila, a radiated tortoise who died at age 188. Almost all of these dates are estimates that can't really be confirmed.</p><h2>The Keys to Your Turtle's Health </h2><p>Of course, feeding your turtle a healthy diet is an important component of helping it live a long and healthy life. Turtle diets can vary widely depending on the species. Some species, like the softshell turtle, eat mostly fish and meat. Other species, like the red-eared slider, eat a mix of insects, fish, and veggies.</p><p>Be sure to properly research the ideal diet of your new pet turtle. Many turtles do well with a mix of commercial turtle pellets and fresh foods, but the exact proportions and types of pellets and fresh foods will vary widely. A proper diet can help avoid Vitamin A deficiency, one of the most common health problems for pet turtles. Calcium deficiency, often secondary to Vitamin D deficiency, is a major problem in turtles and tortoises that are kept indoors without a UV light and can cause soft shells and poor growth.</p><p>A diet isn't the only component of a healthy turtle. Be sure that your turtle is well-cared-for with regular vet visits. A clean enclosure with enough space will also go a long way to keeping your turtle disease-free. Dirty living conditions and the stress that comes with them can dramatically shorten your turtle's life. The proper temperature is also important for keeping your turtle happy and healthy.</p><h2>Common Threats </h2><p>Be aware of the typical diseases that threaten your specific species of turtle. This will help you know how to prevent them or catch the symptoms early. Abscesses, shell infections, respiratory infections, and parasites are all relatively common in pet turtles. Abscesses and respiratory infections are often secondary to a Vitamin A deficiency, whereas shell infections usually come from poor water quality or an injury. You probably won't notice parasites unless you have your vet do regular fecal screenings for your pet.</p><p>Turtles that live in outdoor ponds or tortoises that live in the backyard are more vulnerable to predation and the elements than their indoor-dwelling counterparts. The daily risks for an outdoor turtle are much higher than the risks for an indoor turtle, so be sure your pond or habitat is secured from predators and has adequate protection from the elements. An outdoor pet turtle may get eaten or harassed by other pets and wildlife. Be sure your pet can't escape from the habitat by burrowing under the fencing. Keep wild animals away that could expose your pet to diseases.</p>",762
16,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-do-turtles-sleep-5217498,Reptiles & Amphibians > Aquatic Turtles,<h1>How Do Turtles Sleep?</h1>,"<h1>How Do Turtles Sleep?</h1><p>Land and aquatic turtles are popular pet reptiles, but their behaviors can be mysterious. Sleep is one of these mysterious behaviors since it's hard to tell when a turtle may be awake if they aren't walking around or eating. Sleep patterns and ideal environments for sleep vary from species to species but regardless of what kind of turtle you care for, they all rest at some point. Knowing how a turtle normally sleeps can help you recognize the signs that something may be wrong with your turtle if these sleep patterns change.</p><h2>Turtle Sleep </h2><p>Both land turtles and aquatic turtles sleep, but it can be hard to tell when they are resting. Some research on the state of sleep in turtles has been done but it varies in species and results so there is still a lot we don't know about sleep in turtles. What we do know though, is that turtles do rest but the difference between their wake and sleep states may not be as dramatic as it is in other animals and people.</p><p>Pet turtles usually sleep throughout the day in short spurts but they may also sleep for several hours at a time. Aquatic turtles may spend hours sleeping on a dry dock or with their head poking out of the water but they may also sleep underwater for shorter periods of time, coming up to take a breath when necessary. Land turtles don't swim like aquatic turtles so they can sleep anytime, anywhere.</p><h2>Turtle Sleeping Environments </h2><p>Many environmental factors can alter your turtle's sleep patterns. If your turtle's environment is not ideal, your turtle may sleep more or less often than it should, and it could even develop an illness. Ensuring these following factors are appropriate for your specific type of turtle can help encourage a normal sleep cycle.</p><h3>Lighting </h3><p>Both land and aquatic turtles are more likely to have consistent sleep patterns if they have a regular white light cycle. It's important to note that a white light bulb is different than light bulbs that emit red or purple light that reptiles cannot see. Most turtles, including painted turtles, red-eared sliders, cooters, common box turtles, and map turtles, are diurnal so they are more active during the day and they sleep more at night. The regular light cycle is important because they spend their waking hours basking in the sun so if your turtle doesn't have consistent lighting, its sleep cycle may be abnormal.</p><h3>Shelters and Platforms </h3><p>While different turtles have different preferences in how and where they like to sleep, you should always provide a land turtle with a shelter and an aquatic turtle with a platform. Land turtles need a place to hide and aquatic turtles need a dock to dry off on. These hides and docks often become the preferred places for sleeping. Plastic containers with an opening cut out, a half log, pile of rocks to form a cave, and store bought shelters designed for pet reptiles can all be used for land turtles. Homemade floating docks made with PVC tubing, rock piles, and store bought floating turtle platforms are ideal options for aquatic turtles to rest on. Regardless of whether your turtle lives on land or in the water, make sure it can easily fit in or on the shelter or platform you provide.</p><h3>Temperature </h3><p>In addition to the white light, the temperature of your turtle's environment may be the biggest factor in your turtle's sleep pattern. Turtles are ectothermic or cold-blooded, so they rely on the ambient temperature to regulate their body temperature. If their environment is too cold for too long, they may sleep more. Different species of turtles have different ideal temperatures so be sure your turtle's environment isn't too cold.</p><h2>Sleep vs. Brumation </h2><p>Brumation is a form of hibernation that occurs in reptiles. Turtles that are kept in a controlled, warm environment year-round can still go into brumation but consistency of their environment will decrease the likelihood of it occurring. Brumation is similar to sleeping, but in brumation, the body temperature, heart rate, and respiratory rate drops for an extended period of time. Turtles in brumation may not wake for days at a time.</p>",707
17,https://www.thesprucepets.com/metabolic-bone-disease-in-reptiles-1237237,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>Metabolic Bone Disease in Reptiles</h1>,"<h1>Metabolic Bone Disease in Reptiles</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Metabolic bone disease (MBD) is a well-recognized and common disease seen in pet reptiles. Metabolic bone diseaseresults from an improper calcium to phosphorus ratio in the body, causing softened and damaged bones. Other terms which may be used for this disease include fibrous osteodystrophy, osteomalacia, secondary nutritional hyperparathyroidism, osteoporosis, and rickets.</p><h2>What is Metabolic Bone Disease in Reptiles? </h2><p>Metabolic bone disease is a complex disease. The primary problem is a disruption of calcium metabolism which causes a host of related problems. Due to the importance of calcium in bone formation and muscle function, most of the signs and symptoms are related to bone and muscle development. There is no single cause of MBD and the disease is not as simple as calcium deficiency.</p><h2>Symptoms of Metabolic Bone Disease in Reptiles </h2><p>Symptoms of MBD vary depending on the severity and length of time over which the condition has developed. A veterinarian who specializes in reptiles and amphibians will be able to best recognize symptoms of MBD.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Leg Abnormalities </h3><p>A reptile's legs can become bowed or swollen if it has MBD. Bumps may develop on the long bones of the legs. The bumps are the body's attempt to strengthen the skeletal structure with fibrous tissue to compensate for the lack of calcium in the bones.</p><h3>Spinal Aberrations </h3><p>A reptile with this symptom will have an arched spine. Or bumps will develop along the bones of the reptile's spine as well as the base, which are other areas of the skeletal structure that the body is trying to strengthen with fibrous tissue.</p><h3>Jaw Distortions </h3><p>The bones of the jaw can also become depleted of calcium which will cause it to malfunction. The jaw of a reptile will soften and there may be swelling of the jaw (which is why this disease is sometimes called ""rubber jaw""). In addition, the lower jaw of the reptile may recede in response to calcium deficiency.</p><h3>Shell Softening </h3><p>In turtles, such as yellow-bodied sliders, softening of the carapace or plastron (the shell) occurs with MBD.</p><h3>Uncontrolled Movements </h3><p>MBD results in reptiles developing muscle tremors, jerky movements, or twitching in the muscles of the legs and toes.</p><h3>Anorexia </h3><p>The reptile will not be able to eat or drink once the disease affects its jaw and tongue.</p><h3>Defecating Issues </h3><p>MBD causes a reptile to become constipated or experience obstipation (not defecating at all).</p><h3>Bone Fractures </h3><p>MBD causes the bones to break due to bone weakness and lack of calcium.</p><h3>Reluctance to Move </h3><p>Weakness, lameness, and even partial paralysis can occur with MBD. The reptile will sometimes be unable to move its legs or lift its body off the ground because of how weak and lethargic it feels. This is also due to the depleted calcium in the reptile's bones.</p><h2>Causes of Metabolic Bone Disease </h2><p>Normally, the ratio in a reptile's body of calcium to phosphorus ratio should be around two parts calcium and one part phosphorus (2:1). When the calcium level is relatively low the body tries to compensate by taking calcium from wherever it can, including from the bones. This leads to a softening of the bones making them susceptible to fractures and also leading to a deposition of fibrous tissue as the body tries to strengthen the bone in an absence of available calcium. Calcium also impacts a number of other physiological systems, including muscle contraction and blood clotting.</p><p>Therefore the 2:1 ratio of calcium to phosphorus is ideal in your reptile's diet but calcium metabolism is not that simple to fix. Vitamin D (especially D3) is also vital to calcium metabolism and because some reptiles do not absorb vitamin D that well, they need ultraviolet light exposure to manufacture their own vitamin D, further complicating the problem.</p><h2>Diagnosing Metabolic Bone Disease in Reptiles </h2><p>Metabolic bone disease is distinctive enough that a diagnosis is usually made based on the symptoms, physical exam, and a discussion of proper husbandry (meaning the equipment used to care for the reptile and the habitat in which it lives). Radiographs (X-rays) may be taken to confirm the diagnosis and monitor treatment. Calcium levels in the blood may also be tested.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment of MBD depends on the severity of the disease. For very mild cases, a switch to a balanced diet and appropriate husbandry may be enough. Severe cases require intensive calcium and vitamin supplementation as well as an increase in high-intensity UVB rays under an exotics veterinarian's care.</p><h2>Prognosis for Reptiles with Metabolic Bone Disease </h2><p>A diagnosis of metabolic bone disease requires timely treatment or the reptile will not survive. The prognosis for reptiles with mild symptoms is positive as treatment is tolerated quite well. Even reptiles with more severe symptoms and treated will make a full recovery. Though it may be difficult, it is not impossible for a reptile with an extreme case of metabolic bone disease to recover with the right treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Metabolic Bone Disease </h2><p>MBD is almost always a result of poor husbandry but it is also generally preventable by providing a proper environment and diet specifically for your type of reptile. This is not always easy or inexpensive for a reptile owner to do but is vital to the health of allpet reptiles.</p><p>Proper husbandry is more than just providing the right diet.</p>",874
18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bearded-dragon-eggs-4171698,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>What to Do if Your Bearded Dragon Lays Eggs</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Bearded Dragon Lays Eggs</h1><p>0</p><p>Bearded dragons arepopular pet reptiles for both beginnerand experienced reptile enthusiasts. Some people opt to care for one bearded dragon while others decide to have two or more. But regardless of how many bearded dragons you have, if one of them is a female, you may one day suddenly discover eggsin the enclosure.</p><h2>Can a Bearded Dragon Who Lives Alone Lay Eggs? </h2><p>Yes, even a female bearded dragon that lives alone can lay eggs. This may be because it recently spent time with a male bearded dragon or simply because it is not uncommon for female bearded dragons, and other types of animals, to lay infertile eggs without ever having been with a male. Chickens are a prime example of an animal that lays infertile eggs regularly.</p><h2>Bearded Dragon Nesting Behavior </h2><p>When a female bearded dragon is getting ready to lay her eggs,she may seem more lethargic than usual and spend more time sleeping or laying under the heat lamp. The bearded dragon's belly will also appear larger than usual since it is filled with eggs. Once the eggs are almost visible from the outside, they will appear like marbles inside your bearded dragon and you will be able to feel them.</p><p>A bearded dragon that has eggs yet to be laid is referred to as being gravid. After about three weeks, a gravid bearded dragon will begin to dig in her enclosure. This is the start of nesting behavior and indicates you'll need to provide your bearded dragon with a proper nesting area. Fill a small container to use as a nest box with clean, moistened bedding that the eggs can be buried in. Many types of reptile dirt or vermiculite bedding options can be used for this.</p><p>Place this container in your bearded dragon's enclosure under the heat lights for her to dig in. Some people also opt to use completely separate containers, such as a plastic storage bin, for their bearded dragons to lay their eggs in so that they can control the temperature of that enclosure (or place the container in an incubator) more precisely. If you choose to go this route, make sure the bedding is preheated and moistened prior to your bearded dragon laying eggs in it.</p><p>Bearded dragons typically lay about 20 eggs at a time in groupings called clutches, and they can lay several clutches in a four-month season (but some have laid as many as five). Be prepared to provide your bearded dragon with additional calcium while she's gravidand more food than usual until she lays all the eggs. This is true for all gravid females, whether or not the eggs could be fertile.</p><h2>Problems With Bearded Dragons Laying Eggs </h2><p>Bearded dragons that retain eggs for over 45 days may be egg bound. If it has been over a month since you first saw eggs inside your bearded dragon, shehasn't laid any, and she's lethargic and sleeping a lot, you need to get her to a veterinarian as soon as possible. The eggs may need to be removed, sometimes surgically, and your bearded dragon may have low calcium levels that need to be addressed. Egg binding is life-threatening and should not be ignored.</p><h2>Bearded Dragon Egg Incubation and Care </h2><p>Once the eggs are in the moistened, clean bedding, be sure to keep the soil between 80 and 85 Fahrenheit,using heat lights or an under tank heater, and at 75 percent humidity by misting the soil regularly (but try not to mist the eggs directly as this can encourage mold growth). The eggs will take between 55 and 75 days to hatch if they are fertile. If they are not fertile, they will never hatch and can be disposed of at any point.</p><p>If you are unsure whether or not they are fertile, you can hold a flashlight up to the egg and look for a pinkish embryo inside. This practice of lighting up the egg temporarily to see if there is something inside it is called candling. Be sure not to handle a fertile egg too much while handling it though, as it could damage the growing bearded dragon inside. Wait at least a few days after an egg is laid before candling or rotating an egg. Otherwise, you may risk detachment of the embryo inside the egg.</p><p>Caring for fertile eggs can be difficult and tedious. You'll need to monitor the humidity and temperature closely and watch for mold on the eggs. This is why most breeders will use an incubator and uncover the eggs from the soil so they can see them. You won't want to move the eggs around any more than absolutely necessary though, so if you decide to keep them buried, you shouldn't be uncovering them and moving them around daily. If you don't have an incubator, it's best to use a thermometer and hygrometer that sit in the nest with the eggs and wait patiently until hatching time.</p>",831
19,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bearded-dragon-morphs-4173672,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>11 Types of Bearded Dragon Morphs</h1>,"<h1>11 Types of Bearded Dragon Morphs</h1><p>Bearded dragons come in a variety of different colors, patterns, and something referred to as morphs or mutations. Morphs explain what a bearded dragon's body type or size looks like. Different bearded dragon morphs may have different colors, but they can also have differing spikes, scales, head shapes, nail colors, patterns, and more.</p><p>Some morphs can fetch a hefty price from breeders and are less commonly seen than other morphs, so it's wise to be prepared and educated before going out to purchase a bearded dragon. Here are 11 types of morphs to get you started on your hunt for your one-of-a-kind bearded dragon.</p><h2>Classic or Standard Morph </h2><p>Often recognized as a basic bearded dragon, the classic or standard morph is the kind of bearded dragon that is most like its wild counterpart. Standard morphs have backs that are covered in small spikes and have large triangular heads with a beard. They can come in a variety of different colors, such as tan, red, yellow, and have black and orange markings. These are the most commonly seen morph of bearded dragons and usually the least expensive morph to purchase.</p><h2>Hypomelanistic Morph </h2><p>0</p><p>The term hypomelanistic means ""below normal color"" and in the case of a hypomelanistic bearded dragon morph, these dragons look somewhat pastel in coloration. Hypomelanistic morphs are unable to produce dark patterns and colors. Their nails are also usually clearer than those of other morphs and they simply appear muted in color when compared to that of a standard morph. This morph type is fairly common and has a body type with spikes just like the standard morph.</p><h2>Leatherback Morph </h2><p>The main identifying trait of a leatherback bearded dragon morph is its smooth back. Leatherback morphs do not have spikes on their backs but do have them on their heads and sides. The lack of spikes on their backs also makes their colors appear more vivid and therefore makes them a popular bearded dragon morph. These are a more rare type of bearded dragon morph than the standard and hypomelanistic morphs.</p><h2>Translucent Morph </h2><p>As its name implies, the translucent bearded dragon morph is named as such due to its almost see-through spikes and scales. Translucent morphs are also commonly hypomelanistic so they are typically lighter in color. Baby translucent morphs have an almost clear belly that appears blue, like that of a leopard gecko, and adults typically have solid dark eyes where no iris is visible and occasionally blue eyelids. These unique eyes are what most obviously sets this morph apart from the others.</p><h2>Silkback Morph </h2><p>Possibly one of the most unique types of bearded dragon morphs, the silkback is completely lacking the classic spikes that other bearded dragons have. They have smooth skin and vibrant colors since there are no scales impeding them. Silkbacks are also referred to as silkies because of how soft their skin feels. They are more difficult to care for than other morphs.</p><h2>German Giant Morph </h2><p>Appearing just like a standard or classic morph, the German giant morph is a very large bearded dragon. It is difficult to know whether or not you have a German giant until they are full-grown, and these morphs require a much larger enclosure because of their size.</p><h2>Dunner Morph </h2><p>Named after the breeder who created them, the Dunner morph looks similar to a classic morph except there is no obvious pattern to their scales. The markings of a Dunner morph seem to go in any direction instead of the typical stripes found fairly symmetrical on many other types of bearded dragons. Dunner morphs often have spots, and their scales are not organized, so even patternless Dunner morphs can be identified from their unorganized scales. Often they also have more scales than other morphs.</p><h2>Zero Morph </h2><p>Extremely rare, the zero bearded dragon morph is completely lacking of patterns and colors. These white bearded dragons are growing in popularity.</p><h2>Witblits Morph </h2><p>Not quite a zero, but more muted than a hypomelanistic, the witblits morph is a very pale colored dragon with no patterns. They can come in different solid colors.</p><h2>Wero Morph </h2><p>A combination of the witblits and the zero morphs has produced a newer morph called the wero. The wero often resembles the zero morph except it has splotches of darker colors near its tail.</p><h2>Paradox Morph </h2><p>This uniquely patterned morph was created by crossbreeding a combination of several different morphs. Aparadox morph is obvious to spot since it has blotches of bright colorson its body. They look as though paint was splattered on their bodies in no obvious pattern.</p>",754
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bearded-dragon-behaviors-1238400,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>Bearded Dragon Behaviors</h1>,"<h1>Bearded Dragon Behaviors</h1><h2>What your bearded dragon is trying to tell you</h2><p>Bearded dragons exhibit a variety of behaviors. Recognizing what behavior your beardie is exhibiting and why it is showing this kind of behavior is important to truly understand your pet. It is also helpful to know what behaviors are normal and which ones are signs of stress or illness.</p><h2>The Wave </h2><p>Arm waving is used by both sexes to show submission. Young bearded dragons may do a slow ""wave"" with one of their arms to signal, ""I'm just a baby! Don't hurt me!"" Your young beardie may even do this when it sees you walking up to it if it is intimidated by you, but they usually do this to older bearded dragons whom they don't know very well.</p><h2>The Head Bob </h2><p>When bearded dragons feel they have dominated something or someone they may bob their heads. This is literally what it sounds like. They bob their head as though they were saying ""yes."" More dominant beardies may do this in passing to younger beardies. Younger bearded dragons may do ""the wave,"" while the older or more dominant dragon may concurrently ""head bob.""</p><h2>The Beard Puff </h2><p>Bearded dragons get their names from the area on their throat where a human might have a beard. This ""beard"" can be puffed out and darken to black on-demand when your beardie gets upset. It may also choose to puff and darken its beard if it feels threatened, if it isn't feeling well, or if it is trying to display dominance (often done during mating season to impress the ladies).</p><h2>Color Changes </h2><p>Overall body color changes and beard color changes may occur slowly as your bearded dragon grows, but if a sudden or temporary color change is noted, it could be due to stress, illness, or an emotion. Beardies will often darken or turn black if threatened or upset. If your bearded dragon's coloration of skin becomes lighter, it could be due to an impending shed.</p><p>They will also darken their beards while exhibiting the beard puff. Most bearded dragons will change colors and darken when brought to their exotics vet if they aren't used to traveling (keep your beardie warm on the way to the vet) or handling.</p><h2>Glass Surfing </h2><p>This is strange behavior that bearded dragons exhibit in times of boredom and stress. Beardies will run back and forth alongside their enclosure (often a glass tank) and stand on their hind legs trying to run up the side. It looks comical, and you may even think your beardie is playing or sees his reflection in the glass but it isn't doing this for fun.</p><p>If your beardie is glass surfing, it may need a larger enclosure or more playtime outside of its enclosure, or something else is stressing it, such as a pet cat staring at it or the loss of a cage mate. Glass surfing should be considered an abnormal behavior, and beardies can actually hurt themselves by rubbing their feet, bellies, and faces on the glass repeatedly.</p><h2>Digging </h2><p>Female bearded dragons may naturally burrow if they are trying to lay a clutch of eggs. In the wild, beardies cover their eggs to incubate them and keep them safe from predators. In captivity, they shouldn't have to worry about the predators, but most bearded dragon breeders will remove the eggs after they are laid and incubate them at controlled temperatures in incubators.</p><p>If your beardie is digging, be sure to provide the appropriate substrate so that it can lay its eggs, make sure you are offering enough calcium in its diet, and monitor its eating and activity levels carefully. Many bearded dragons become egg-bound and need assistance or surgery to remove all of the follicles or eggs from their bodies.</p><h2>Brumation </h2><p>Brumation is like hibernation for reptiles. Some reptiles in the wild will brumate when the weather gets cooler and food is more scarce. In captivity, temperatures are controlled and food is always available, so brumation is not necessary nor is it recommended. If your reptile isn't eating, moving much, burying itself, and defecating, he or she may be trying to brumate or could be sick. Make sure you contact your exotics vet to make sure your beardie isn't sick or dying.</p><p>Do not stop lighting, heating, or offering food to your bearded dragon in order to force a brumation. Continue to keep all of these resources available at their normal levels and quantities.</p>",739
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bearded-dragon-prolapse-1238193,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>Common Causes of Bearded Dragon Prolapse</h1>,"<h1>Common Causes of Bearded Dragon Prolapse</h1><p>It's a scary thing to see a pink bulge coming from the rear end of your pet bearded dragonwhile they are straining but this prolapse of the cloaca can occur due to a number of reasons. This is something that should be addressed with the utmost care and you should not be lazy with getting or performing the treatment. This article will cover the common causes of a cloacal prolapse and what you can do to treat it.</p><h2>Causes </h2><h3>Lack of Calcium </h3><p>More often than not a lack of calcium in your bearded dragon'sbones causes their cloaca to prolapse. Not having enough calcium can be due to a diet low in nutritionor from not having enoughUVB rays in their habitat.Since calcium makes bones strong and allows muscle contractions to move and retract, low calcium can lead to prolapses of internal organs outside of the body.Having said this, it is important to gut load crickets, dust the crickets with a multivitamin that contains calcium, and provide appropriate UVB lighting for your pet bearded dragon.</p><h3>Intestinal Parasites </h3><p>Being infected with an abundance of parasites is another common reason why your pet bearded dragon will strain and prolapse their cloaca. You should have a fecal sample checked by your exotics vet to rule out having too many parasites. If the fecal test is positive,a deworming may be necessary to lessen or clear the parasitic infection and help prevent further prolapses from occurring.</p><h3>Diarrhea </h3><p>If your bearded dragon is straining because they have diarrhea from eating watery foods or for another reason he could prolapse. Offering foods that are more nutrient and fiber dense, such as dark leafy greens, should help prevent prolapses if this is the cause.</p><h3>Laying Eggs </h3><p>If your female bearded dragon has recently laid eggs, is in the process of laying eggs, or is trying to lay eggs (she doesn't have to have been with a male to lay eggs) she could be straining to pass the eggs and in turn prolapse. Offering appropriate calcium in the diet and UVB lighting in the enclosure will help her body have normal contractions. In order to stop problems with follicle and egg production in bearded dragons, consider bringing in your beardie to your exotics vet to discuss a spay procedure to stop the possibility of recurrence kof prolapse from egg laying.</p><h2>Replacing the Prolapse </h2><p>If your bearded dragon prolapses the first thing you should do is moisten what came out. Lubricating gel and water can all keep the important tissues healthy while you replace, or get help replacing, the prolapse. Sometimes by soaking the prolapse in sugar water, you can help shrink it since the sugar absorbs excessive fluid. This may make replacing the prolapse easier.</p><p>The first step in replacing a prolapse is to contact your exotic veterinarian. Prolapsed tissue can be very friable, or break, in the process of replacement so its better to trust the experts in safely reducing your pets prolapse. If you are unable to find a vet, you can attempt at home but understand it could become worse if not done right. To replace the prolapse, keep it lubricated and apply gentle wide pressure (gloved finger pad- not Q-tips!) directly to the pink tissues. If possible, work from the outside in and try to gently push the tissue back into the cloacal opening. If you are concerned about tearing tissues, hurting your bearded dragon, or you are having any trouble, you should rush him to your exotics vet. Sometimes sedation and/or anesthesia is necessary to relax your beardie or two sutures may need to be placed on either side of the cloaca to keep the prolapse in place after pushing it back in.</p><p>Once the prolapse has been replaced you'll want to determine the cause and make sure it doesn't come out again. If a prolapse is out for an extended period of time and is not kept lubricated the tissues may die and surgery may be necessary to remove dead tissue. If a large amount of tissue has died off, euthanasia may be suggested by your veterinarian as well.</p>",733
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/atadenovirus-adv-in-bearded-dragons-1238407,Reptiles & Amphibians > Bearded Dragons,<h1>Atadenovirus (ADV) in Bearded Dragons</h1>,"<h1>Atadenovirus (ADV) in Bearded Dragons</h1><p>Bearded dragons, like other reptiles, are prone to a variety of diseases. Some of these diseases are more serious than others, and atadenovirus is, unfortunately, one of the more serious ones.</p><h2>What Is Atadenovirus? </h2><p>Atadenovirus, formerly known as adenovirus and also commonly referred to as ADV (not to be confused with ADV in ferrets or skunks), is a highly contagious virus that is prevalent in bearded dragons (). Many people call this disease the ""wasting disease"" or ""stargazing disease"" due to the symptoms exhibited by bearded dragons with ADV.</p><p>Like all other viruses, this virus is microscopic, so you cannot see it with the naked eye. There are also a number of different strains of this virus that affect different kinds of animals.</p><p>Atadenovirus can infect many kinds of lizards. Agamid lizards (bearded dragons, water dragons, and Rankin's dragons), chameleons, gekkota lizards (fat-tailed geckos, leopard geckos, and tokay geckos), helodermatid lizards (Gila monsters and Mexican beaded lizards), monitors (savannah monitors and emerald monitors), and skinks, such as the blue-tongued skink, can all be infected by this virus. ADV is also known to infect snakes, chelonians (turtles and tortoises), and there is even a report of it infecting a Nile crocodile.</p><h2>Atadenovirus Symptoms in Bearded Dragons </h2><p>This disease is called the ""wasting disease"" or ""stargazing disease"" for a reason. A young bearded dragons with ADV typically will not survive past three months of age and will spend its short life struggling to grow. It will be lethargic, lose weight, and not want to eat. The symptoms may be described as ""non-specific"" or your exotics vet may simply say your beardie is ""wasting away"" or is a ""poor doer."" This is usually because a bearded dragon with ADV has a weakened immune system. It can be negatively affected by intestinal parasites such as coccidia, which makes it seen that it cannot ever gain weight.</p><p>Some bearded dragons with ADV can experience neurological symptoms such as body twitching and seizures. It may arch its neck and look up at the sky (stargazing) due to what the virus does to its nervous system. Bearded dragons that are infected with atadenovirus as adults typically develop liver and kidney disease, encephalitis, gastroenteritis, stomatitis, and other conditions. Unfortunately, most of these findings are only discovered after the bearded dragon dies, and a necropsy is performed. Oddly, some bearded dragons never show any symptoms and are lifelong carriers of the virus.</p><h2>How Bearded Dragons Get Atadenovirus </h2><p>A bearded dragon can quickly become infected with the virus if it is exposed to the feces of a carrier dragon, are handled by someone who handled an infected beardie, shares a cage with an infected dragon, or eats leftover food from an infected dragon. Since the virus is extremely contagious and carrier bearded dragons may never show symptoms, it is easy to think a bearded dragon is healthy, expose it to another outwardly healthy bearded dragon, and then one of the beardies begins to show neurological, stargazing symptoms.</p><h2>How Is Atadenovirus Diagnosed? </h2><p>To figure out if you beardie has atadenovirus, your exotics vet will recommend a fecal swab for PCR testing, which looks for virus DNA. Many owners are wary of costs associated with testing for diseases in their exotic pets, but tests must be run to confirm ADV in your bearded dragon. Alternatively, if a bearded dragon in your collection dies, it is recommended to submit the body for a necropsy to have it tested for ADV as a possible cause of death.</p><h2>How Is AtadenovirusTreated? </h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no cure for atadenovirus. A dragon with ADV can only be treated to alleviate its symptoms. It should be housed alone to prevent further infection to other bearded dragons and reduce its competition with other beardies for food. It will continue to need appropriate UVB lighting and heat. If it has a secondary infection due to a suppressed immune system, antibiotics may be prescribed. If the beardie is dehydrated, warm water soaks may be recommended, and syringe feeding may also be necessary if it is not eating well. Its quality of life must be assessed regularly to make sure euthanasia is not a better option over palliative care.</p>",696
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/keeping-water-in-your-turtle-tank-clean-1238362,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Keeping the Water in Your Turtle Tank Clean</h1>,"<h1>Keeping the Water in Your Turtle Tank Clean</h1><h2>A clean tank is essential to turtle health</h2><p>Red-eared sliders and other aquatic turtles spend a lot of time in the water, so clean water is essential. Of course, turtles also defecate in their water, so maintaining good water quality can be a challenge. Cloudy and smelly water in a turtle tank is a common problem, but even water that looks clean can harbor waste products such as ammonia and nitrites that can build up to harmful levels. Maintaining good water quality is an important aspect of keeping turtles healthy.</p><h2>Water Quality </h2><p>Though turtles generally aren't as sensitive to water quality issues as fish, treat turtle tanks much like fish tanks.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>As waste products in the tank break down, ammonia is formed, which is potentially toxic and can be irritating to your turtles even at low levels.</p><p>As a tank becomes established, beneficial bacteria grow in the tank and filters. Some bacteria break down ammonia into toxic nitrites, which are then converted by other bacteria into less harmful nitrates. These are then controlled by water changes. Before this ""nitrogen cycle"" becomes established (or if it is upset in an older tank), levels of harmful by-products or the bacteria that use them can spike, causing problems such as cloudy water.</p><h2>Water Testing Kits </h2><p>Pet stores carry test kits for ammonia, nitrates, and nitrites. Monitoring these levels can help you catch conditions in the tank that can be irritating or harmful for your turtles. Check with the pet store and follow the directions included with the kits; the instructions will also have information on safe and dangerous levels of each chemical. If the levels of ammonia, nitrates, or nitrites are too high, do a complete water change. If you find your levels are moderate or creeping up, do more frequent partial water changes or a complete change.</p><p>The pH (a measure of acidity) is not as critical to turtle health as the waste product levels, but measuring pH is also a good idea. Generally, red-eared sliders are pretty tolerant of small pH changes, but keeping an eye on pH levels can alert you to chemical changes in your turtle's water. The pH should be in the range of 6-8 for red-eared sliders. Pet store products enable you to safely lower or raise the pH if necessary.</p><h2>Concerns About Chlorine </h2><p>There are conflicting opinions on whether tap water should be dechlorinated for turtles. Turtles may not be as sensitive to chlorine as fish or amphibians, but chlorine can still be an irritant to them, especially their eyes. Chlorinated water may also destroy the beneficial bacteria in the tank, affecting the nitrogen cycle and breakdown of waste products. Thus it's ideal to dechlorinate the waterthe easiest way is to use water conditioners, available at pet stores.</p><p>Some cities use chloramine in addition to chlorine to treat tapwater. If this is the case where you live, find a water conditioner labeled to remove chlorine, chloramine, and ammonia (a by-product of the deactivation of chloramine). Chlorine will dissipate from the water after about 24 hours, but chloramine does not.</p><h2>Tank Size: The Bigger, the Better </h2><p>Water quality and cleanliness are easier to maintain in a larger tank. In a smaller amount of water, the waste products are more concentrated. With a larger tank, waste matter and its by-products are diluted. In a larger tank, partial water changes are more practical for maintaining consistent water quality, rather than having to change a large proportion (or all) of the water in a smaller tank. A general guideline often quoted is 10 gallons per inch of turtle.</p><h2>Filtration </h2><p>There are several options for filters. When it comes to turtles, choose a filter rated for two to three times the size of your turtle tank. For instance, if you have a 20-gallon tank, choose a filter rated for 60 gallons, even if the tank is not full. Filters with several different levels for removing waste matter as well as by-products are recommended (i.e., mechanical, biological, and chemical filtration). The topic of filters can seem complicated and dauntingfilter types and filtration sites cover the pros and cons of different filtration methods as well as tips on maximizing the benefits of filters.</p><h2>Partial Water Changes </h2><p>Regularly take out part of the water and replace it with fresh water. This removes and dilutes waste products. The frequency of partial changes and how much water you need to change out will vary depending on factors including the size of your turtle(s), the size of the tank, the filter, and whether you feed in the tank. Frequent partial water changes (weekly or perhaps two to three times a week if necessary) will do a lot to help keep the water quality high. Using a gravel vacuum or a siphon to remove water makes this job a lot easier, but never prime a siphon by mouth due to the risk of salmonella contamination.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Be aware of the risks of salmonella and take appropriate precautions when you are changing water, cleaning filters, or other turtle tank accessories, and handling your turtles.</p><h2>Skip the Substrate </h2><p>Keeping the bottom of the tank bare makes cleaning easier since wastes and uneaten food can't get trapped in the rocks. Rocks or large gravel (too big to be ingested) at the bottom of a tank can be attractive but aren't necessary.</p><h2>Feed Outside of the Tank </h2><p>One way to reduce the amount of waste you need to manage in the tank is to feed your turtle in a separate container, though this is a matter of choice. Try a smaller plastic tub or storage container. Using water from the tank is an easy way to make sure the temperature of the water is warm enough; just replace the water taken out for feeding with fresh water (and you've done a partial water change at each feeding). This eliminates the problem of excess food decaying in the tank, and turtles often go to the bathroom shortly after eating, so the amount of turtle waste accumulating in the tank is reduced as well. Then you can just clean and sanitize the lightweight feeding container after each feeding.</p><p>However, this is a lot of additional work and the extra handling may be stressful. You may choose the separate feeding tub for messier or higher protein meals, and feed other less messy foods like greens and vegetables in the tank. Many owners decide to feed in the tank too, which is fine, especially with a good system of filtration, water changes, and monitoring. Scooping out excess food particles and doing water changes shortly after feeding can also help if you feed in the tank.</p>",1138
24,https://www.thesprucepets.com/turtle-shells-peel-1238366,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Scute (Shell) Shedding in Water Turtles</h1>,"<h1>Scute (Shell) Shedding in Water Turtles</h1><h2>Learn how to tell if your shedding turtle is healthy or sick</h2><p>0</p><p>A turtle's shell is composed of about 60 bones. The bony shell is covered with a thin layer of epithelium, which produces the hard outer shell layer. If you've noticed your turtle shedding on its shell, it's likely that the pieces of this hard layercalled scutesare preparing for new growth. As the turtle grows, the epithelium produces a new scute beneath the old ones that is a larger diameter than the one layered on top of it, allowing the shell to expand.</p><h3>What is a Scute on a Turtle?</h3><p>A turtle's scutes are the plate-like, hard scales on its shell. Similar in composition to the keratin of fingernails, scutes protect the bones and epithelium of the shell underneath.</p><p>In most turtles and tortoises, the scutes remain on the shell for life, which causes the shell to thicken and protects it. The outer layers of scutes can be worn down, especially in burrowing tortoises, but are not normally shed. In many species of water turtles (Genera , , , , and ), however, they shed the outer layer of scutes annually. This keeps the shell from getting so thick and heavy that it makes it hard to swim, and it also helps to rid the shell of coatings of algae and other things that grow in an aquatic environment.</p><p>It's perfectly normal for water turtles to shed their scutes as they grow. But a peeling shell can also indicate disease, depending on the type of turtle and whether it's healthy.</p><p>In addition to shedding scutes, all turtles and tortoises shed the skin on their legs and necks. A turtle's skin is different from yours because it's not elastic and doesn't stretch to allow for growth. As turtles grow, you'll see that they outgrow and shed their old skin in stages.This is most noticeable in aquatic turtles, and it also serves as a way to stave off infections</p><h2>Why Do Turtles Shed Their Scutes? </h2><p>Healthy shedding occurs as part of a water turtle's normal growth, as the shell expands with the rest of its growing body. Other common reasons for shell problems include bacteria, parasites, algae, environmental issues, and poor nutrition. It's important to be able to distinguish healthy shedding from problems that could endanger your pet's health or life.</p><p>First, determine whether the shell under the peeling scutes looks normal. Anytime the shell looks deformed, reddened or bloody under the scute, has exposed bone, or the shell feels soft or spongy, there's a problem and you should seek veterinary advice as soon as possible. You should also see a vet if your turtle is continuously shedding scutes or the scutes are peeling but not falling completely off.</p><h2>Healthy Shedding </h2><p>Peeling as part of the growth process is normal as long as the thin layers come off, revealing shell that looks and feels normal.</p><h2>Health Issues That Cause Shedding </h2><p>(abnormal shedding) can leave your pet's shell exposed and vulnerable to infection. It can also be a sign of liver, kidney, thyroid, or bone disease, or a nutritional deficiency. Bacterial shell rot is another serious problem, which can lead to permanent shell deformity. Other reasons why your turtle might shed abnormally include:</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment depends on the severity and cause of your turtle's dysecdysis. If the problem is relatively mild, start by ensuring that conditions in your pet's habitat are optimal. In some cases, minor changes to your pet's enclosure can eliminate the problem.</p><p>If the problem is more serious or is not alleviated by changes to the habitat, it's best to check with the vet. While it's possible for you to remove fungi and algae from your turtle's shell, it's easy to injure the shell. It's best to have an expert handle the problem. Your vet may also be able to diagnose an underlying medical issue and prescribe medication.</p><p>One of the more common treatments for shell rot is debriding: a process of gently cleaning off the rotten shell and then treating the underlying tissue with antibiotics such as silver sulfadiazine cream. Vets may also give the turtle an injection of ceftazidime or another antibiotic. Some turtles need regular debriding (along with a proper habitat and nutrition) while the shell heals. If the turtle's shell is fractured or has deep rot, vets are often able to patch the shell until it grows back on its own. It may take months for a shell injury to return to normal.</p><p>If you are cleaning the shell yourself, use a very soft scrubber such as a soft toothbrush and work very slowly and carefully. If you don't have access to antibiotic cream, another option is an antibacterial ointment such as Betadine or Povidone-Iodine. Once debrided, a turtle should be kept dry and warm for a few days, but with access to a small bowl of water for drinking. This process may have to be repeated several times over the course of a few weeks. If, after several debridings and use of antibacterial ointment, your turtle is still showing signs of shell disease, visit your vet.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>In many cases, there's no need to prevent scute shedding. It's a necessary and important part of water turtle growth and health. To avoid problems, however, it's important to maintain an appropriate environment for your turtle and check in with a vet as soon as health issues arise.</p>",900
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/turtle-and-tortoise-lighting-1239537,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>Turtle and Tortoise Lighting</h1>,"<h1>Turtle and Tortoise Lighting</h1><p>Pet tortoises and turtles of all kinds need the same types of lighting. Heat bulbs and UVB bulbs are both vital to properly care for your pet turtle or tortoise. If proper temperatures and lighting are not provided your pet is at risk for developing serious health problems.</p><h2>Do I Need UVB Lighting for My Tortoise or Turtle? </h2><p>This is, unfortunately, the most commonly forgotten part of a turtle or tortoise habitat. Many people opt not to buy the most expensive piece of a set up when they purchase their pet reptile from a pet store. These same people also tend to depend on the pet store associate to help them buy what they need for their new tortoise or turtle, and unfortunately, they are often told that UVB lighting is not necessary.</p><p>Without UVB lighting your tortoise or turtle can and will develop metabolic bone disease, be unable to synthesize Vitamin D (which causes calcium metabolism problems),be lethargic, and have a lack of appetite. UVB lighting is very important for these reasons.k</p><h2>Providing UVB Lighting to Turtles and Tortoises </h2><p>Natural sunlight emits invisible UVB rays in the wild, but many turtles and tortoises are housed indoors, causing these rays are blocked by window glass. Artificial UVB rays are delivered to your pet tortoise in an indoor enclosure through the use of special reptile bulbs. These bulbs run out of UVB rays about every six months, so they do need to be changed regularly.</p><p>UVB rays must also be able to reach your tortoise or turtle without being scattered or blocked by glass, plexiglass, or screens. An ideal distance between your pet and a regularUVB light is 10-20 inches, depending on the wattage of the bulb, with nothing in between them and the light. A mesh screen is okay to set your UVB light on, but it does decrease the amount of invisible rays that will penetrate through to your tortoise or turtle.</p><p>Some owners mount the UVB light fixture on the inside of the enclosure, while still keeping it 10-12 inches from the pet, to avoid a screen top from filtering out the light. The distance of this light is very important. A UVB light that is too close will cause thermal burns, much like a tanning bed would, but a light that is too far away won't do much good at all because there won't be enough UVB rays that reach your pet.</p><h2>UVB Light Options for Turtles and Tortoises </h2><p>The most traditional type of UVB light is the fluorescent strip light. This special bulb designed for reptiles looks like any other fluorescent bulb that you'd find on the ceilings of most any school or place of business, but it can be a UVB light. Be sure to confirm that the strip light emits UVB rays. Regular fluorescent lights do not emit UVB rays.</p><p>The compact fluorescent UVB bulb looks like a corkscrew or has a few small fluorescent tubes that create the bulb. This bulb is good if you don't have the right fixture for a fluorescent strip light, but you do have an extra clamp light laying around. The downside to these bulbs is that it only covers a small area, unlike an 18-inch or 36-inch long strip light.</p><p>Mercury vapor bulbs are more expensive but typically last longer, are much more powerful than other UVB bulbs, and also emit heat. These are great for large enclosures or entire rooms that house larger tortoises.</p><h2>Heat Light Options for Turtles and Tortoises </h2><p>Many tortoises and turtles require basking temperatures in the 80s and 90s, so supplemental heat is needed in most enclosures. Be sure to check what your specific species needs for heat. Heat lights are preferred over under tank heaters, because you can control the ambient air temperature. Under tank heaters often have little or no settings to control the heat and primarily warm the bottom of the enclosure while failing to warm the ambient air temperature, making achieving a proper thermal gradient difficult.</p><p>There are a variety of heat lights for tortoises and turtles, but it is important to find out what bulb wattage the enclosure requires to keep it at the desired temperature. Usuallylarger enclosures will need higher wattage bulbs, and smaller enclosures will naturally require less wattage to maintain appropriate temperatures.</p><p>Aside from the mercury vapor bulb which also provides UVB rays, ceramic heat emitters, and regular reptile heat light bulbs are available in various wattages. Ceramic heat emittersonly emit heat, no light, and screw into a clamp light. These are great because they last a long time, are less fragile than the light bulbs, and can be used day or night since they don't give off any light. Regular reptile heat bulbs can emit white, red, or blue/purple light in addition to heat. White heat light bulbs should only be used during the day so you don't stress your tortoise or turtle out, but you can switch over to a red or blue/purple heat light at night.</p>",832
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/transporting-pet-turtles-by-car-1239423,Reptiles & Amphibians > Box Turtles,<h1>How to Transport Red-Eared Slider Turtles by Car</h1>,"<h1>How to Transport Red-Eared Slider Turtles by Car</h1><p>Occasionally you may need to transport a pet red-eared slider turtle by vehicle (for example, during a move). This can be a very stressful time with turtles, but with some planning and preparation, the move can go quite smoothly.</p><h2>Transport Box </h2><p>For travel in the car, your turtle can be placed in a plastic box such as a storage container. Holes can be drilled in the lid of such a box for ventilation, but you will want something that closes securely since turtles can be adept at escaping. Place a good layer of padding in the bottom of the box, such as a towel (but avoid any with loose threads or loops that could entangle the turtle's claws), paper towels or newspaper. The box should have a bit of space for the turtle, but don't give the turtle lots of room to move around (the goal is to pad the turtle well and make him or her very secure).</p><h2>What About Water? </h2><p>Even semi-aquatic turtles such as red-eared sliders can handle being out of the water for quite a while. For extended trips, you may choose to mist the turtle and or dampen the padding at the bottom, but keep in mind this will be cooling to the turtle so only do this if you can keep the turtle warm enough. For trips of a few hours, your red-eared slider will be fine if kept dry. However, on longer trips, you might want to provide a large water dish shallowly filled with water and take a break to refill it and offer your turtle some time to drink of get into the water dish itself.</p><h2>Temperatures </h2><p>This will be your biggest challenge, though typically overheating is probably more of a concern that being too cool (though a cold turtle will be sluggish and can be predisposed to developing illnesses). Use a thermometer on the turtle's box or get a temperature gun to monitor the temperatures. If you are traveling in warm weather, there are a few alternatives. You can regularly mist your turtle or keep the padding damp; evaporation of this water will be cooling. If your car has air conditioning, you can use this to keep the car cool, being careful not to let the turtle get too cool (and don't put the turtle in front of an air vent). You can also place the turtle's box inside a cooler (the styrofoam ones work well for this- keep the top open for aeration) and add a wrapped cool pack to the cooler. Never put an ice pack or cool pack directly in the turtle's boxkeep the cool pack separated from the turtle itself.</p><p>In cooler weather, you may need to use a warming pack in much the same way. Place the turtle in its box inside a cooler, and add a wrapped heat pack (a bottle of hot water, a microwaved potatoe, a sock with heated rice, or a heating pad set on low (if you have a plug-in) for longer trips). Again, never let the turtle come in direct contact with the hot pack.</p><h2>Air </h2><p>If you have drilled some holes in your box for ventilation, your turtle will probably be fine. However, especially for longer trips, you may want to open up the box periodically to let in some fresh air. Throughout long trips, periodically check that no mold or fungus is growing in your pets' container, especially because they are living in a damp environment.</p><h2>Food </h2><p>Since turtles, dependent on age of your animal, may be able to go a few days without food, you can feed your turtle prior to the trip to ensure they are eating, and then see how their appetite is throughout the trip. Two to three days of not eating in an adult red-eared slider is a normal feeding schedule gap, so if they don't eat during the trip, it isn't a big dealas long as they eat again when you are at your final destination. Juveniles or hatchlings need to be fed daily, regardless of travel.</p><h2>Overnighting in Hotels </h2><p>If you need to stop overnight, make arrangements well ahead of time and make sure you get permission to keep your turtle in your room. Bring a medium-sized plastic storage tubyou can set this inside the bathtub and give your turtle some warm water to swim in. Be courteous to the cleaning staff and other guests by not putting your turtle directly in the tub or sink or letting it roam around the room (due to the risk of contaminating surfaces with bacteria). When you pack your turtle back up in the morning, simply dump the turtle's water down the toilet. To be extra courteous, wipe down the bathroom surfaces and anywhere else the turtle may have had contact with anti-bacterial wipes.</p>",802

Most people are not at risk for serious disease, but everyone should take some basic steps to decrease their chance of infection. Basic hygiene is the key to keeping you, your family and your turtle safe and healthy.</p><h2>What Is Salmonella? </h2><p>is a genus of bacteria that are known to cause gastrointestinal illness. It is shed in contaminated water or food and has absolutely nothing to do with salmon. It is very common for many reptiles to carry and not show any clinical signs. It is part of their normal gastrointestinal microbes. Clinical signs in humans may include nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea and other GI signs. If you suspect you may have salmonelosis, contact your health professional. Veterinarians are required to report any human infections transmitted from pets to state or local health departments.</p><h2>How Did My Turtle Get Salmonella? </h2><p>is not just specific to turtles or even reptiles in general. It makes up the normal gastrointestinal flora of many reptiles. It does not cause disease in these species except for some extreme instances. Your pet may be carrying and test negative if they are not actively shedding the bacteria. It is best to assume any reptile or amphibians may be carryingSalmonella.</p><p>can also be carried by many other species including cats, dogs, rodents, and other pets. An outbreak of Salmonellainfections in hedgehogs occurred in 2013 and involved several states and over two dozen people. can also cause infections in humans and other animals from infected food. has also been associated with rodents fed to other reptiles, such as snakes. This includes frozen rodents!</p><p>The risk of contracting is real and should be taken seriously, however, with proper handling and care, you can drastically decrease your risk of infection. If you are a healthy individual and live with other healthy people, you are at minimal risk. As with most infectious disease, there is greater risk for the very young, the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend not keeping reptiles at all in households with at-risk individuals).</p><h2>How to Prevent Salmonella Infections </h2><h3>For Humans </h3><p>When it comes to keeping turtles and other reptiles, there is one key point to keep in mind: wash your hands. Wash your hands before handling your pet reptile and immediately after. Do not kiss or lick your turtle and supervise children handling pets. If your child cannot keep their mouths away from your pet, it is best to limit their interaction. The ban on selling hatchling turtles in the US was enacted back in 1975, largely in response to infections of in children from pet turtles (which were small enough to fit in their mouths), which were widely available back then.</p><p>Keep all of your turtle system cleaning equipment out of your kitchen and clean it regularly. Do not use any of your turtle system equipment for other household tasks or other reptile systems. For aquatic turtles, do not use your equipment on other aquatic systems, such as fish tanks.</p><h3>For Reptiles </h3><p>Turtles, especially aquatic turtles, like to make a mess of their tanks and swimming pools. Since Salmonella resides in their gut, any feces should be properly handled and disposed of regularly. Regular cleaning of the enclosure is critical to reduce your risk of contracting Regular water changes for aquatic turtles should be part of your regular maintenance. Do not suck on any hoses to get siphons started! This will increase your chance of coming into contact with . After handling tank water, be sure to wash your hands and clean your equipment.</p><h2>What Are ""Salmonella-Free Turtles?"" </h2><p>In recent years, the concept of Salmonella-free turtles was introduced, where bacteria are eradicated from turtle eggs, resulting in -free hatchlings. However, studies have shown that previously -free turtles may eventually test positive for And remember, a negative test does not mean the turtle is assumed negative! It just means they are not currently shedding any bacteria. Veterinary treatment of in asymptomatic turtles using antibiotics is unsuccessful and are not treated unless clinical signs are present and a culture and sensitivity test has been performed.</p><p>Therefore, do not waste your money on these ""bacteria-free"" strains. The idea of buying -free turtles only give owners a false sense of security. Even if you have a Salmonella positive turtle, which you most likely do, the risk of catching it is minimal if you take good care of your turtle and practice basic hygiene.</p><p>For more information about and reptiles, visit the Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians.

Because of these traits, it's best to house multiple Senegal chameleons separately and be content to watch them rather than play with them.</p><h2>Senegal Chameleon Housing </h2><p>The Senegal chameleon is a sensitive reptile so its environment needs to be just right for it to thrive in captivity. A mesh or screened enclosure is the best option for it as a pet. Air circulation and ventilation along with the abundance of climbing options are perfect in a cage with screens as sides but just be sure the enclosure is of adequate height. Senegals will climb vertically in a cage, not from side to side.If a screened or mesh enclosure is not an option for your chameleon, a 29-gallon high tank is usually recommended.</p><p>Your Senegal's cage should also be equipped with plenty of vines and artificial plants to climb along with a dripper system unless you are diligent enough to mist the enclosure several times a day. Chameleons drink their water off of plant leaves, not out of a bowl, so it is crucial there are wet leaves in the enclosure that your Senegal can drink from daily.</p><p>Although mesh cages are best for chameleons, they are awful for maintaining the high humidity level that Senegals require. This is where the dripper systems, automatic misting, and fogger systems can help if you aren't physically spraying water onto the leaves daily. Without a high humidity level in the cage, your Senegal chameleon will become dehydrated, lethargic, and may have difficulty shedding.</p><h2>Senegal Chameleon Heat and Lighting</h2><p>Your Senegal enclosure should have both heat lights and a full spectrum UVB light. The heat lights need to be able to keep the basking area around 85 degrees. The rest of the enclosure should not drop below 70 degrees. Depending on the temperature of the room, the size of the enclosure, and the type of enclosure, different heat lights and wattages may be needed to achieve these temperatures.</p><p>The UVB lighting is a special light that increases metabolism, appetite, activity, and most importantly, synthesizes Vitamin D3 which is crucial in the calcium absorption process for your chameleon. It is a substitute for the invisible UVB rays that the sun would normally provide a chameleon if it were outside. Without UVB lighting, your chameleon will likely develop metabolic bone disease, not grow properly, and suffer from weakened or broken bones. Even if you provide calcium in your chameleon's diet, without the UVB lighting the animal won't be able to absorb it. Make sure your UVB light is placed about 12 inches away from the highest point in the cage that your chameleon can reach in order to avoid thermal burns. Ideally the UVB light will not be filtered by anything, especially a plastic or glass covering, as this will greatly decrease the amount of UVB rays that reach your chameleon.</p><h2>Senegal Chameleon Food and Water </h2><p>A Senegal chameleon in captivity likes to dine on crickets, mealworms, and other insects that are readily available in the pet trade. It catches its prey by shooting its long tongue out of its mouth. The tongue sticks to the insect and retracts back into the chameleon's mouth. A healthy chameleon focused on catching its food will successfully catch the insect in nine out of ten attempts.</p><p>Gut-loaded insects that are dusted with a calcium powder should be offered every few days, if not daily. You should never put more crickets in your chameleon's enclosure than he will eat in a short amount of time. Crickets left overnight may start biting your chameleon and cause small wounds that can become infected.</p><p>Also, since chameleons eat live prey, it is important to have a regular fecal examination performed by your exotics vet to check for microscopic intestinal parasites.</p><h2>Choosing Your Senegal Chameleon </h2><p>As with most pet lizards, it's best to get a Senegal chameleon from a reputable breeder since it's not possible to ascertain what parasites or other potential hazards a wild-caught variety may have been exposed to.Ideally, you'll be able to watch the chameleon eat before purchasing it. If it refuses food, this could be an indication that it is not healthy. Other things to look for are if its eyes are cloudy or it has excess mucus around its nasal passages and mouth. These signs could mean the chameleon has a respiratory infection or another ailment.Finally, a chameleon with dry patches on its skin may be having problems shedding, which also is not a good sign and purchasing a sick chameleon is not ideal.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Senegal chameleons, like many reptiles, are prone to several different types of health issues.</p><p>If your chameleon seems unwell or is acting strangely, don't hesitate to consult a veterinarian who is experienced in treating reptiles. Most of these illnesses can be treated successfully if caught early.</p>",948
29,https://www.thesprucepets.com/first-month-with-your-chameleon-5101219,Reptiles & Amphibians > Chameleons,<h1>The First 30 Days with Your Pet Chameleon</h1>,"<h1>The First 30 Days with Your Pet Chameleon</h1><p>If you've decided to add a chameleon to the family, you have much to look forward to, but you should also prepare for a period of adjustment.</p><p>Chameleons have unique and particular requirements for both their habitat and their care. They are also stressed quite easily. With patience and planning, you can make the first 30 days with your chameleon go as smoothly as possible.</p><h2>Before Bringing Your Chameleon Home </h2><p>Finding the right spot for your chameleon's enclosure is a top priority. Chameleons enjoy the warmth of natural sunlight, but don't appreciate draughts. However, you must also consider the size of the chameleon's cage. Enclosure setups are typically 3 x 3 x 4 feet or bigger, which means your chameleon will require quite a large space in your home.</p><p>These exotic reptiles require an advanced set up to achieve the correct temperatures, humidity, and conditions that meet their liking. Setting up a habitat from scratch can take a bit of time, making it crucial to completely set up their cage before bringing your chameleon home. You will also need to test out all the technical equipment to ensure it is working properly.</p><p>Once the habitat is set up, allow the heat lamps and misters or drip systems to run to raise the temperature and humidity to the required level. Putting a chameleon in a cage that doesn't have the right conditions can quickly lead to health problems and, if they are already feeling stressed about a new environment, this makes the proper conditions even more important.</p><h2>Day 1 </h2><p>When you are ready to bring your chameleon home, it is a good idea to have the habitat misted and to have fresh, gut-loaded food ready. This will eliminate the need to disrupt the environment while your chameleon gets settled in.</p><p>Do not be alarmed if your chameleon immediately hides or lacks vibrant color. These reptiles do not acclimate to change easily, so give them time. You may find them sleeping for long periods.</p><p>During sleep, a chameleon's color is pale and unexciting. This does not mean they are sick.</p><p>You should keep the environment adjusted to the right conditions, minimize any noise and major activity around the home, and avoid the temptation to try to handle them.</p><h2>Day 10 </h2><p>By day 10, your chameleon should be getting used to their new home and to their immediate surroundings. However, keep in mind that they are very cautious creatures so any interactions should be done slowly and patiently.</p><p>At this stage, you may wish to start hand-feeding to build trust. Be sure to hold your hand a comfortable distance away from your chameleon to prevent them from feeling nervous. They can then make a choice to come closer if they feel comfortable. If you aren't keen on holding an insect directly in your hand, a pair of tongs or tweezers works as well.</p><p>Don't be disappointed if your chameleon is too wary to take the insect at first. Building trust with this timid reptile takes patience. Leave it for the day and try again the next day - never force things. Eventually, your chameleon will learn that your presence means food, not danger.</p><p>Even if you're successful with hand-feeding, you should still avoid handling your reptile at this stage. Chameleons are observation pets to begin with, and it is extra important to avoid any unnecessary stress during the first month. Even with good intentions, grabbing at your chameleon or forcing them to come to you will break the trust you are building. To them, this will only look like a predatory action.</p><h2>Day 30 </h2><p>With a whole month inside their new home, your chameleon will most likely be more comfortable with exploring their surroundings. And with a little diligence, they may even be eating out of your hand!</p><p>Regular handling of a chameleon isn't a necessity and it shouldn't be forced, but if they are confident and actively approaching you, you can start to attempt more contact. Again, you must allow the chameleon to come to you in their own time. Otherwise, you will only break the trust.</p><p>To start working towards a tame chameleon, simply leave the chameleon's cage door open and place a branch near the opening. This will allow the chameleon to explore outside when they feel ready. Once they are comfortable with this, try placing your hand near the branch. Do not grab or try to coerce your chameleon onto your hand. Allow them to grow accustomed to your hand being there. It may take many tries before your chameleon is confident enough to climb onto your hand.</p><p>Once they willingly climb onto your hand, you can reward your chameleon by feeding them tasty treats or taking them to a bright, sunny spot to roam and bask. This will begin to connect handling with good things, encouraging your chameleon to come out more readily.</p><p>Keep in mind that every chameleon is different, so you may get to this point faster than 30 days. On the other hand, some chameleons are extra cautious and may take much longer. Every one has its own unique personality and some types of chameleon are more susceptible to stress from environmental changes and handling.</p><p>Even if you are successfully able to hold your chameleon, it is important to remember not to handle these reptiles too often. Chameleons are solitary creatures that do not enjoy large amounts of handling.</p><p>Adding a chameleon to your home is an exciting experience but requires a gentle period of adjustment. These incredible creatures make fascinating pets but the transition to your home can be stressful for these timid creatures. With preparation and patience, you can make this experience as stress-free as possible.</p>",941
30,https://www.thesprucepets.com/jacksons-chameleon-1238536,Reptiles & Amphibians > Chameleons,<h1>How to Care for Jackson's Chameleons</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for Jackson's Chameleons</h1><p>Jackson's chameleons were not discovered by a scientist named Jackson; rather their name comes from an ornithologist and prior governor of Kenya, Frederick Jackson.</p><p>These chameleons were native to East Africa, but in recent years have been introduced into California, Hawaii, and even Florida.</p><p>Young Jackson's chameleons are brownish, developing brighter greencolorationat about four or five months of age. Males tend to be more brightly colored, with blue or yellow markings. They're sometimes called three-horned chameleons because the males of the species have small brown horns above their eyes and one on the nose.</p><h2>Jackson's Chameleon Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Jackson's chameleons are territorial and should be housed individually. Handling is stressful to them, so as with other chameleons, they are pets better suited to being watched than handled.</p><h2>Housing the Jackson's Chameleon </h2><p>Chameleons should never be kept in a glass terrarium. They need the ventilation provided by a mesh enclosure; fine metal or fiberglass mesh is not recommended. Vertical space is essential since chameleons like to climb high up off the ground.</p><p>An outdoor cage can be used when the weather is warm enough, as long as overheating is prevented.</p><p>Cleanliness in the cage is vital in preventing bacterial and mold growth. Using paper towels or newspaper to line the cage makes cleaning easiest. Some keepers use soil (no vermiculite or perlite) or peat moss, but these are harder to keep clean and dry.</p><p>Potted plants can be placed on a plain paper substrate for easier cleaning while still allowing live plants in the cage. Do not use wood chips or any other substrate that could be accidentally ingested and cause blockages.</p><p>Provide lots of sturdy non-toxic plants and branches for your chameleon to climb on. Ficus trees have often been used in chameleon housingbut require some caution as the sap can be irritating. Other plants you could try include pothos, hibiscus, and dracaena.</p><p>Artificial plants may also be added; artificial vines work well. A good selection of branches (of different diameters) should be provided, making sure there are secure perches at different levels and temperatures within the cage.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>For Jackson's chameleons, a daytime temperature gradient of about 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit (21 to 26.5 degrees Celsius) should be provided, with a basking spot up to a maximum of 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius).</p><p>At night, they should have a temperature drop of about 10 to 15 degrees Fahrenheit (5 to 10 degrees Celsius), so heating at night may not be required if your home's temperature doesn't fall below 65 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (18 to 21 degrees Celsius). Heating is best accomplished by using a basking or incandescent light in a reflector or a ceramic heat element, any of which should be placed outside of the cage to prevent burns.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Chameleons also need a full-spectrum ultraviolet (UVA/UVB) light source, so you should invest in a good bulb. Keep the UV light on for 10 to 12 hours per day. Remember that these bulbs need to be replaced every six months or based on the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p>Chameleonsbenefit from spending time outdoors in natural sunlight when the temperatures are appropriate but beware of overheating as Jackson's chameleons do not tolerate well temperatures higher than 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius).</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Jackson's chameleons need a humidity level of 50 to 80 percent. This can be accomplished by misting the plants in the enclosure regularly (at least twice daily) and through the use of a drip or misting system. Chameleons rarely drink from a water bowl, but they will lap up droplets of water off plants; the misting and a drip system also serve as water sources.</p><p>Position a drip system so that the water droplets cascade over the plants in the enclosure. Also, invest in a hygrometer to measure the humidity.</p><p>Chameleons are insectivores, so feed them a variety of insects. Crickets are usually the mainstay of the diet but mealworms, super worms, waxworms (all in limited quantities), roaches, silkworms, flies, fruit flies (for young chameleons), and grasshoppers can also be fed. Wild-caught insects should only be fed if you are certain they have not been exposed to pesticides, and always avoid fireflies. All insects should be gut loadedbefore feeding them to your chameleon.</p><p>Also, some chameleons eat a bit of plant matter, including live plants in the cage, so use non-toxic plants. Collard greens, mustard greens, turnip greens, and sugar snap peapods are possibilities (try attaching them to the side of the cage).</p><p>You will have to monitor your chameleon and adjust feeding amounts as needed; if many insects are left uneaten or your chameleon is too full-bodied, back off the amount fed. Don't leave uneaten live prey in the cage for an extended time as the insects may attack and injure your chameleon.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Parasitic infections are very common in insectivores, especially if the animal is stressed or ill. As with most reptiles, Jackson's chameleons are prone to respiratory infections and fungal infections. These conditions should receive care from a reptile veterinarian.</p><h2>Choosing Your Jackson's Chameleon </h2><p>Look for a reputable breeder to ensure your pet has been treated appropriately. Chameleons should have alert eyes, without any cloudiness. Swollen limbs or digits may indicate an infection, so be on the lookout for this condition. Ifyour Jackson'schameleon is drooling or wheezing, these are signs of respiratory infections.</p><p>Jackson's chameleons should have skin without bruising or cuts. The first thing you should do after you get your Jackson's chameleonis to havea reptile veterinarian check it for parasites.</p>",915
31,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-chameleons-make-good-pets-5101214,Reptiles & Amphibians > Chameleons,<h1>Do Chameleons Make Good Pets?</h1>,"<h1>Do Chameleons Make Good Pets?</h1><p>From eyes that move independently of each other to their color-changing skin, the chameleon is a never-ending source of wonder! Keeping one as a pet, however, takes particular knowledge and very specific living conditions.</p><p>If you are a novice reptile owner, welcoming a chameleon into your home requires careful research and planning. Don't let that scare you away, though. If you have the time and commitment, the rewards of caring for one of these incredible reptiles make the extra effort worth it.</p><p>Learn more about what it's like to keep a chameleon as a pet by understanding their cage and care requirements, activity levels, life expectancy, and health challenges.</p><h2>Low Levels of Activity and Minimal Handling </h2><p>Although they are interesting animals to observe, chameleons are not exactly cuddly or energetic pets. Children may not be drawn to a chameleon the way that they would a hamster scurrying on its wheel or a dog that wants to play fetch with them.</p><p>These reptiles are most active during the day, from about dawn till dusk. This is good news if you're looking for a pet that will be awake and moving on the same schedule as you. Don't expect a high level of activity though. They are quiet animals that spend most of their day lounging in a comfy spot, only moving to regulate body temperature, feed, or fill another specific need. You won't have to worry about any racket from your chameleon cage interrupting a work call or proving to be a distraction in your daily routine. They also won't need you to provide them with lots of stimulation the way some other pets will.</p><p>Many chameleons do still appreciate time out of their cage, with room to roam in a safe space. Be careful not to lose your color-changing friend in large rooms or areas with many places to hide. Handling should be kept to a minimum too, and it should be with minimal restraint, as this can stress chameleons out.</p><h2>Specific Dietary Requirements </h2><p>Compared to pets who eat kibble in bowls, the chameleon has unique dietary requirements. These reptiles eat live gut-loaded bugs, so feeding time is hunting time. If you're squeamish about delivering live insects or don't think you can commit to regular pet store runs for this special food source, a chameleon might not be the right pet for you.</p><p>On the other hand, if live feeding doesn't phase you, then dinner time becomes showtime for you. Watching your chameleon catapult its long tongue and capture prey with incredibly accurate precision is a sight to behold.</p><h2>Technical Cage and Kit Requirements </h2><p>Generally speaking, chameleons make excellent pets for experienced reptile owners. This is not to say that novice owners can't keep a chameleon successfully, but there are specific cage and care requirements to consider.</p><p>Chameleons regulate their body temperature by moving from warmer to cooler areas within their enclosure. You need to provide a cage that is large enough to allow for the variances in temperature. Given a chameleons arboreal habits, it also needs to be tall and should provide enough foliage (real or artificial) to give the chameleon a sense of security.</p><p>While cage set-ups can vary tremendously, you should plan for, at least, a 3 x 3 x 4 foot cage. Like other reptiles, the chameleon will also require a heat lamp with a UVA/UVB bulb and a spot to bask in the rays from the lamp that is no closer than eight inches from the heat source.</p><p>You'll need a thermometer to measure the temperature at the top and bottom of the cage, along with a hygrometer to gauge the humidity level. Since chameleon's lick up water from their environment, you'll need to equip the cage with a misting or drip system.</p><p>Clearly, chameleons require an advanced set-up and specialized care in comparison to some other reptiles. The cost of investment for a chameleon-specific set-up may be more than expected for a first-time reptile owner.</p><p>However, the good news is that chameleons are very clean pets. They have no scent and produce droppings with very little smell. This makes a chameleon a great option as a pet for those that are sensitive to pet odors.</p><h2>Life Expectancy and Health Concerns </h2><p>Evaluate what type of commitment you're looking to make before settling on a specific species of chameleon, since their lifespans vary considerably. Among the more popular pet chameleon species, the veiled chameleon lives for five to seven years, the Jackson's chameleon is five to ten years, and the panther chameleon is a short two to three years.</p><p>You should also educate yourself on common chameleon health concerns, such as stomatitis, metabolic bone disease, or how to recognize and remedy calcium or Vitamin A deficiencies.</p><p>While the goal is to keep a happy, healthy chameleon, you may need to bring your pet to a reptile or exotic animal vet on occasion. It will even be worth investigating where the nearest specialist vet is located - if it is particularly far afield this could create practical problems.</p><p>For anyone looking for an exotic and unique companion, the chameleon may be the perfect pet. They make an excellent choice for those sensitive to pet odors or noise and capture the eye of experienced and novice reptile owners alike.</p><p>Though chameleons are an enticing pet to buy, it is very important that you do the needed research before bringing one home. These amazing creatures require very specific housing requirements and regular routines and are a significant commitment that needs to be carefully evaluated.</p>",918
32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/considerations-when-buying-a-chameleon-5101217,Reptiles & Amphibians > Chameleons,<h1>5 Things to Know Before Buying a Chameleon </h1>,"<h1>5 Things to Know Before Buying a Chameleon </h1><p>Chameleons are captivating creatures that can change color, move their eyes independently of each other, and catch prey with their long, sticky tongues. It is no wonder that so many are keen to keep these exotic reptiles as pets.</p><p>If you are considering offering a home to a chameleon, keep in mind that these reptiles have unique habitat and feeding requirements that make them more difficult to care for than some other small or exotic pets. Let's look at five important things to consider before buying a chameleon.</p><h2>Chameleons Need Specialized Housing </h2><p></p><p>This reptile requires specific conditions to stay healthy and happy, therefore providing a suitable cage setup is no small task.</p><p>Chameleons live in the trees, which means their tall enclosure must include a large number of branches and plants to provide the dense foliage that these reptiles have in their natural habitats. Doing this helps them feel secure, offers them an opportunity to explore and hide, and minimizes stress.</p><p>A typical setup should at least 3 x 3 x 4 feet. Ideally, the cage should be tall and positioned higher up (like on a table, rather than on the floor). This will help your chameleon to have a preferred, more elevated vantage point.</p><p>Branches and plants are not all that is needed. Chameleons also require extra supplies like a UVA/UVB light source, thermometers, humidity gauges, and misters or drip systems.</p><p>These extra supplies can easily add up in cost, so be sure to calculate how much your desired setup will cost. Some can get quite pricey.</p><h2>Chameleons Require Live Food and Regular Misting </h2><p></p><p>A simple food dish and water bowl won't work for this exotic pet. Just as their cage must be as close to their natural habitat as possible, so must their food and water supply.</p><p>Chameleons eat a diet of live gut-loaded bugs. This means you will need to have a supply of crickets, mealworms, or wax worms on hand. Additionally, you may need to dust the insects with supplements to ensure that your chameleon is getting all the nutrients they need to stay healthy.</p><p>As for water, chameleons drink from water droplets that condense on leaves. Therefore, regular misting is required to ensure your chameleon is properly hydrated. This can be done by hand, but automatic misters can also be used.</p><h2>Chameleons Are Not Cuddly Pets </h2><p></p><p>These eye-catching pets are best kept for observation, not for handling.</p><p>Chameleons are solitary animals that do not like much handling or company. In most cases, it is very important that you house only one chameleon to prevent fights and stress. Males can be particularly violent to other males.</p><p>Chameleons are rather calm animals when in solitary settings, however. They are slow-moving and fascinating to watch.</p><p>Chameleons are not very vocal about disliking a situation. When a chameleon is stressed it will most likely freeze or open its mouth, but it does not lash out or squirm. Therefore, when inexperienced chameleon owners try to handle their chameleons and see this behavior, many can confuse it with acceptance rather than stress. Learning a chameleon's habits and nature can help you properly read signs of distress or happiness.</p><h2>A Good Cage Cleaning Routine is Required </h2><p></p><p>As with any animal that lives within a cage, there are cleaning requirements. To keep your chameleon healthy and happy, there are simple cleaning routines that can be done daily, as well as deeper cleanings weekly and yearly.</p><p>For daily cleaning, a simple spot clean is best. Remove any dead insects or poop and wipe down any stubborn areas.</p><p>On a weekly basis, you will need to wipe out the cage more thoroughly, including a quick wipe-down of the plants and branches within the cage.</p><p>At least once per year, it is best to move your chameleon to a safe, secure area so you can completely take apart the cage. This allows you to soak any branches or accessories, thoroughly wipe plants, and wash the inside of the cage.</p><h2>Chameleons Can Easily Become Stressed </h2><p></p><p>Chameleons are highly susceptible to stress, but their displays of anxiety can easily be missed or misunderstood. It is very important to be able to understand when your chameleon is anxious since elevated stress-levels can make these pets more prone to illness or disease. You should also minimize handling and changes in the environment.</p><p>You should buy a chameleon raised in captivity, rather than attempt to tame a wild-caught chameleon. Chameleons, in general, do not adapt well to captivity or changes in their environment, and this is especially true of wild-caught chameleons that are forced into a new, captive environment. On top of this, wild-caught chameleons can also have other health problems, such as parasites.</p><p>Females chameleons can be prone to extra stress from egg-laying and may be more prone to sicknesses. Male chameleons usually live longer.</p><p>Other common health issues for chameleons may include calcium and vitamin A deficiencies, stomatitis, and metabolic bone disease.</p><p>A chameleon's care requirements are more detailed than many other pets. Therefore, the decision to bring one into your home should be carefully evaluated.</p><p>However, with the proper knowledge and setup, chameleons can be extremely enjoyable pets that offer endless amounts of wonder to your daily life.</p>",855

Unlike a dog or cat, not all veterinarians at your local animal hospital are able and willing to treat a reptile, so it's helpful to do a little research before you make the drive.</p><h2>Can My Normal Vet Treat My Chameleon? </h2><p>Legally, any licensed veterinarian can treat any animal, including a chameleon, but not all veterinarians are comfortable doing so.</p><p>In vet school, veterinarians all learn the basics of disease processes, preventative care, pharmacology, surgery, and other aspects of veterinary medicine. Depending on what their personal interest are, they usually also have the option to take certain niche classes and this can include the treatment of reptiles.</p><p>Different species get different diseases and benefit from different medications. You cannot treat a pig the same way you treat a cat, or a chameleon the same way you treat a cow. Veterinarians understand this and may refuse to treat a chameleon if they don't have specialist knowledge about them.</p><p>Vets that see chameleons often have a personal interest in the species and have appropriate resources, medications, and equipment to treat reptiles in their hospitals.</p><p>They will usually have taken formal classes on reptiles in vet school or after they graduated for continuing education credits. Often they will have completed or are currently working on their speciality in reptiles and amphibians under the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners(ABVP). Sometimes they may have completed or currently be carrying out an internship or externship with another vet that is experienced in this field.</p><h2>Finding an Exotic Pet Specialist Veterinarian </h2><p>In order to find a vet that is comfortable and knowledgeable in treating chameleons, you will have to do a little research. The same vet that sees your dogs and cats may also see chameleons, but you will need to ask them to be sure. If they do not see chameleons or you do not currently have a vet for any of your pets, you can find an exotic pet vet a few different ways.</p><p>The Association of Reptile and Amphibian Veterinarians (ARAV) has a simple to use search engine on their website that lists veterinarian members of their association near your address. This is a good starting point.</p><p>Another search engine can be found on the American Board of Veterinary Practitioners (ABVP) website. This site only lists veterinarian specialists and you can narrow your search by selecting ""Reptile and Amphibian"" in the category drop-down list. There are very few reptile and amphibian ABVP specialists in the country, but you may be lucky enough to have one near you.</p><p>Another option is to talk to the place you got the reptile from. Reputable breeders, local pet stores, and rescue groups in your area are likely to know what vets will treat a chameleon that may not be listed with the ARAV or ABVP.</p><p>If you are still having difficulty finding a vet, start calling the animal hospitals in your area and simply ask them if any of the doctors are willing to treat chameleons.</p><p>Having more than one option for a vet is prudent since not all vets are available 24/7. Compiling a list with the hours that each vet is typically available will be helpful in the event that your chameleon needs veterinary attention, especially if it is an emergency situation.</p><h2>What Questions to Ask Your Chameleon's Vet </h2><p>Once you've found a vet that will treat your chameleon, you may want to ask a few questions.</p><p>Find out the veterinarians comfort level and experience in treating reptiles, if any other doctors at the practice or at other clinics nearby are willing to see reptiles in the event they are unavailable, and what their typical appointment hours are.</p><p>If you are new to chameleon care, it would be helpful to get additional advice and recommendations on keeping your chameleon healthy. Things like ideal habitat temperatures, humidity levels, and feeding regimens for your specific type of chameleon would all be worth covering. Your vet can also advise what they feel your chameleon's ideal body weight should be.</p><p>If medications are necessary, be sure to discuss how they are to be administered in order to make things as stress-free as possible.</p><p>Don't forget, if you do spot the signs that you have a sick chameleon, it is important to seek veterinary help as quickly as possible and to keep them as warm as possible.</p>",735

Showing signs of sickness demonstrates weakness to predators and puts them at a higher risk of being eaten.</p><p>Even though pet chameleons are safe in their enclosure, these natural instincts to hide signs of sickness remain and can make it difficult for pet owners to recognize potential problems.</p><p>Knowing what signs may indicate your chameleon is sick can help you get your pet the veterinary attention it may need sooner rather than later.</p><h2>Not Wanting to Eat </h2><p>Fernando Trabanco Fotografía</p><p>Inappetance is a key indicator that any pet may be sick but it can be more difficult to notice when a chameleon isn't eating than it is in some other animals.</p><p>Since live crickets are most commonly offered to pet chameleons in their enclosure, pet owners may assume their chameleon ate the crickets that they put in the cage when in fact the insects are just hiding among the foliage. This means that you may think your chameleon is eating when it actually isn't.</p><p>In order to avoid this problem, feed only a few crickets every few days and try and make sure your chameleon eats them all. If you are unsure whether there are uneaten crickets living in the cage, place some cricket food in a dish at the bottom of the cage to lure them out.</p><h2>Spending Time in an Unusual Part of the Enclosure </h2><p>Pay attention to your chameleon's normal hangouts so you can easily recognize when it's somewhere it normally isn't. Your chameleon may have a favorite spot or two in its enclosure, so if it's spending time in an unusual area like the bottom of its cage, this could indicate that it is unwell.</p><p>During the day, spending time near the heat light on a favorite branch is common but if it is on the ground or hasn't crawled up to the top of the cage as it normally does during the day then your chameleon may have something wrong with it.</p><h2>Dull Color </h2><p>Paul Biris</p><p>While normal shedding will also result in a temporary dulling, muted color changes outside of the shedding cycle can be concerning. Chameleons are known for their bright colors so if they are a dull, dark, or ashey in color instead of being vibrant, this can indicate your chameleon is sick.</p><p>Dehydration, skin issues, a low body temperature, lack of UVB rays, malnutrition, stress, and other things can cause your chameleon to have a color change.</p><h2>Sunken Eyes </h2><p>Simon Lindley / EyeEm</p><p>Some of the most profound physical attributes of a chameleon are its eyes. A chameleon has eyes that stick out of the side of their head and can move independently from each other. These eyes should appear rounded or almost pyramidal in shape in a hydrated, healthy chameleon. But if a chameleon is dehydrated, stressed, or sick, the eyes may appear sunken, flatter than usual, and perhaps even be closed.</p><h2>Abnormal or Absent Fecal Matter </h2><p>Springhill2</p><p>Normal chameleon stool should be dark brown to black and in a formed oval shape with a small amount of moisture. The white to yellow urates may also be seen but the feces should not be bloody, watery, or runny.</p><p>Both constipation and diarrhea can occur and act as signs that your chameleon could be sick. Paying attention to the amount, color, and character of the stool is very important.</p><p>Chameleons normally defecate once every few days depending on how much and how often they eat but if no normal stool has been produced in over two weeks, this may indicate a problem.</p><p>If a chameleon stops eating, has a gastrointestinal blockage, has an illness that affects its intestinal tract, is dehydrated, too cold, or has intestinal parasites, changes in the stool can occur.</p><p>Providing an appropriate environment and diet are vital for ensuring the good health of your chameleon. Enclosures that are too cold and dry, food that isn't gut-loaded with beneficial nutrients, and cages that don't offer space to climb can result in stress and illness.</p><p>Checking to make sure your cage set-up is appropriate is the best first step to take to avoid sickness that is caused by husbandry issues.</p><p>If you suspect your chameleon may be sick, seek veterinary attention as soon as possible and keep it extra warm. Medications, fluid therapy, or other treatments may be necessary depending on your chameleon's problem but these potential signs of illness should not be ignored.</p>",728
35,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-your-aquarium-tadpoles-4771169,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>How to Care for and Feed Tadpoles in Your Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for and Feed Tadpoles in Your Aquarium</h1><p>Frog husbandry is a combination of a terrestrial and aquatic care. Depending on the species you keep, a frog may only need a little water, or live only in water. If you are just getting started in the amphibian hobby, make sure you do your research so you understand how you desired species needs to be kept.</p><p>Breeding frogs comes with its own unique challenges. Once you have a male and female of the same species, you can start along the path to reproduction. All frogs hatch from eggs, but the number produced during one spawning will differ between species, as will the size, color, and shape of the eggs.</p><p>As they grow into frogs, tadpoles undergo metamorphosis through multiple stages. Successful reproduction and rearing of young frogs relies heavily on how well you care for the tadpole life stages.</p><h2>Tadpole Stages </h2><p>The tadpole stage begins when the tadpole leaves their egg and assume a straight body position. This stage persists until the tail has been absorbed in the body. Tadpoles can be classified by hind and forelimb emergence.</p><p>As your tadpoles age, they can be separated by metamorphosis stage, based on which sets of legs have emerged. Their feeding will change based upon these stages.</p><h2>Tadpole Environment </h2><p>Tadpoles should be separated from their parents and can be kept in individual containers. You can move the tadpoles once they emerge using a baster or small cup. Depending on the species, you may only have a few tadpoles or dozens.</p><p>Tadpoles do best with reverse osmosis water, commonly called ""RO water."" You can purchase it by the bottle or buy a reverse osmosis filter. Depending on the species, you may need to manipulate the pH and temperature. Some species, such as dart frogs, can benefit from tannin-rich, low pH water from the addition of different leaves.</p><p>As with all other amphibians, water quality is key. It is best if you use a low-flow filter to keep from blowing the tadpoles about. A simple sponge filter is best for this stage. Some very small tadpoles may be too small to keep with any filter, so they will rely on you doing water changes. Keep an eye on your water quality and perform regular water changes. If you notice an odd odor, it's definitely time for a water change!</p><h2>Tadpole Feeding </h2><p>Please keep in mind that the timing of these stages are only vague guidelines. Your species may not follow the exact timeline below.</p><h3>Newly Hatched (first few days) </h3><p>Your newly hatched tadpoles will be very hands-off at this stage. They are too young to receive any food.</p><h3>One Week to One Month </h3><p>During this stage, feed your tadpole one tadpole pellet daily. There are a few commercial diets available and are the best choice for your tadpole. Boiling lettuce does not produce suitable nutrition for a developing frog. You can coat the pellet in a vitamin/mineral mix for amphibians if desired.</p><h3>One month: Frog </h3><p>After your hardy tadpoles celebrate their one month birthday and legs start to emerge, they can graduate to only receiving two to three pellets per week. Keep them on the same frog/tadpole pellet and continue the vitamin/mineral topcoat if desired.</p><p>Once your tadpoles have achieved full metamorphosis into a frog, where no tail is apparent, they will need to switch to an appropriate frog diet.</p><h2>Tadpole Treats </h2><p>What pet doesn't like the occasional treat? Keep in mind that all treats are supplemental and should not replace their complete pelleted diet. At most, feed treats once a week.</p><h2>Species-Specific Tips </h2><p>Dwarf Frog: These all-aquatic frogs don't need any haul-outs or dry spots. You do not need to transition them to a terrestrial environment.</p><p>African Clawed Frog: Like the Dwarf Frog, these frogs are all-aquatic and do not need any terrestrial space in their environment.</p><p>Oriental Fire Bellied Toads: Despite their name, these require a semi-terrestrial environment. You will need to provide a transitional stage where the almost-frog can escape their watery home. If able, set their aquatic hatching pool at a 45-degree angle to give them an easy slope to climb.</p><p>White's Tree Frog: After their aquatic tadpole stage, these frogs would rather live in a moist, tree-loving environment. As with the species above, make sure the tadpole stage can start expanding their terrestrial time.</p><p>American Green Tree Frog: Like their other tree frog friends, this species will need to transition to a terrestrial environment.</p><p>Pacman Frog: Although they do not need a lot of water, you need to provide a shallow bowl of warm RO water. If your tank environment is not humid enough, your frog will let you know by sitting in their pool.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Any frog species taken out of the wild be kept with captive animals. If you are raising wild tadpoles, such as bullfrog tadpoles, they need to be returned to the same spot they were found after developing into frogs. It is not recommended to keep any wild frogs as pets.</p>",819
36,https://www.thesprucepets.com/frog-dropsy-1238722,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>Frog Dropsy and Bloat</h1>,"<h1>Frog Dropsy and Bloat</h1><p>African dwarf frogs are usually low-maintenance pets but they are still living creatures who can get a plethora of diseases. Dropsy, or bloat, is one of those diseases that most often affects African dwarf frogs. Dropsy can also affect many other frog species that are kept as pets.</p><h2>About Dropsy </h2><p>The word dropsy is technically another word for edema. If your exotics vet refers to frog dropsy as edema, hydropsy, bloat, or ascites, they are probably referencing the same thing.</p><p>Dropsy (also known as edema, hydropsy, ascites, bloat) presents as severe bloating in your pet frog. Your African dwarf frog may look like a balloon that will just float away if given the opportunity, but they are not filled with air. The reason why your frog is so bloated is due to all the fluid that has built up inside its little body. This fluid may even have seemed to appear overnight and makes your frog very uncomfortable.</p><h2>Causes </h2><p>The disease process of frog dropsy isn't fully understood, meaning we don't really know what makes a frog get dropsy, but we do know that this edema is caused by the lymphatic system.</p><p>In the case of frog dropsy, lymph, the fluid substance that circulates in the lymphatic system, fills the lymph nodes, does not drain properly, builds up outside of the normal tissues it usually stays in, and fills the abdominal cavity of a frog, thus causing the edema.</p><h2>Diagnosis </h2><p>Of course, never assume your frog has dropsy without first consulting an exotics vet. There may be another reason why your frog is swollen. Sometimes frogs eat things that shouldn't be part of their diet, like gravel and rocks from the enclosure, and are actually impacted, not bloated from dropsy.</p><p>A frog with dropsy usually appears to be inflated. An x-ray may rule out ingestion of a foreign object but oftentimes simple palpation and inserting a needle into the frog's abdomen is enough to determine whether or not a frog has it.</p><h2>Effects </h2><p>Just like the pressure that fluid build-up puts on an eyeball with glaucoma, lymph fluid causes extreme pressure on almost all of the internal organs in a frog with dropsy. The kidneys, liver, spleen, and other organs suddenly have an extreme amount of pressure put on them. Imagine a water balloon, filled to the maximum and about to burst with water. If you overfill it, it will pop, rendering the balloon unable to do its job of holding water. Similarly, if so much fluid is pushing on an organ, it is so stressed that it cannot do its designated job. As you can imagine, and as anyone with glaucoma can attest, this extreme pressure is painful. It may cause your frog to be very lethargic and stop eating due to the discomfort and pain (and obviously a frog cannot survive without eating).</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Since we don't know exactly what causes dropsy we cannot exactly cure it. But we can definitely treat the symptoms. This often includes your exotics vet draining your African dwarf frog's abdomen of excessive fluid. This will alleviate the pressure put on the organs and definitely make your frog feel better almost instantaneously. Some people recommend adding salt to your freshwater enclosure to help a frog with dropsy but this is very dangerous. More often than not the salt kills your frog. The idea behind the salt is that it helps to draw some of the excess fluid out of your frog, but since African dwarf frogs are not saltwater amphibians, they usually die from the addition of the salt.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is nothing you can safely do at home to help a frog with dropsy. If you add salt to their enclosure you run the risk of causing a painful end to their life. If you try to drain the fluid yourself, you could puncture something that can't be fixed. Therefore, this is a disease that requires some expertise. Euthanasia, unfortunately, may be an option discussed with your vet if they do not feel as though there is much hope for your frog.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Since we don't know what exactly causes frog dropsy it is hard to say how to prevent afrog from getting it. We do know that it is not contagious and some thought has been directed towards the electrolyte balance of the water causing the disorder. Regardless, it is never a bad idea to keep your water as clean as possible, remove the chlorine from the water, and test the water pH to maintain a neutral level (7.0-7.2).</p>",751
37,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-frogs-croak-5220135,Reptiles & Amphibians > Frogs & Toads,<h1>Why Frogs Croak</h1>,"<h1>Why Frogs Croak</h1><p>Most animals make a noise that is different from other species. Dogs bark, cats meow, guinea pigs wheek, and frogs croak. These sounds are made to communicate a variety of things, but it can be confusing to know exactly what these sounds mean if you aren't of the same species. Find out why pet frogs croak and what they are trying to say.</p><h2>What Is Croaking in Frogs? </h2><p>Croaking is one of the most common noises a frog makes. It is a natural sound that frogs produce, thanks to their anatomy. Frogs have vocal cords that are similar to what people have, but they also have a vocal sac that can amplify the vibrations from the vocal cords. As air moves back and forth between the lungs and the vocal sac, the vocal cords cause the air to vibrate and produce the croaking sound that we hear. When a frog croaks, the throat or sides of the mouth will expand, but its mouth won't open. It will sit still and appear to stare off while making the croaking noise. Depending on the type of frog, this croaking sound can be heard over a mile away, especially if there is a chorus of frogs instead of just one.</p><h2>Why Do Frogs Croak? </h2><p>The main reason why a frog croaks is to attract a mate. Male frogs croak to get the attention of a female frog, even if they don't see or hear one.</p><p>Croaking is an innate behavior and is especially common during a frog's mating season in the spring after it rains. This is because after a good springtime rain, the conditions are ideal for females to lay their eggs. Croaking can then be heard by wild frogs after this rain, and if your pet frog is exposed to similar conditions in captivity, the croaking is also more likely to occur in your home. An increase in misting in the enclosure or a more active dripper system alongside warmer cage temperatures and plentiful food can mimic a natural, outside springtime environment. This will cause your pet frog to croak just like a wild frog. A frog may may also croak to announce an impending danger or as a territorial display.</p><h2>How to Stop a Frog From Croaking </h2><p>It is impossible to stop a male frog from croaking entirely, but you can try and keep it to a minimum. If your frog is croaking, and you want it to stop, try to mist it with water at certain times of the day. If you'd prefer your frog to be quiet at night, save the misting for the morning. Additionally, allow the temperature in the enclosure to drop down to the lowest acceptable point for your specific frog species. Do this slowly over a couple of days so your frog does not get a temperature shock and can adjust to the change slowly. These environmental changes may convince your frog that the conditions are not ideal for a female frog to lay eggs, and they will stop trying to find a mate.</p><p>Sometimes adding in a female to a terrarium that previously only had one male will also keep the croaking to the minimum. If you want to avoid croaking altogether, opt to care for only female frogs. Female frogs do make some vocalizations, but croaking is typically only done by males.</p><h2>What Not to Do if Your Frog Is Croaking </h2><p>Some people may find the croaking noise a frog makes annoying, but it's very important that you not do anything that could harm your frog in an attempt to make it stop. A popular solution for making wild frogs stop croaking near a home is to spray salt water outside around the property, but this is very harmful and irritating to frogs and should never be done.</p><p>Additionally, making drastic environmental changes in an attempt to decrease the croaking can be very dangerous. Lowering the temperature in the enclosure too far may simply cause your frog to temporarily estivate, but decreasing the humidity level can dry a frog's skin out and be potentially fatal. Humidity is essential to a frog's health and survival since they absorb oxygen and hydration through their skin.</p><p>Finally, it should go without saying, but you should not try to silence your frog by holding it too tightly because frogs croak with their mouths shut, closing its mouth won't help and should never be done.</p>",732
38,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-gecko-eyes-1238755,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>What to Do if Your Leopard Gecko Has Eye Issues</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Leopard Gecko Has Eye Issues</h1><h2>Such problems are common in these animals</h2><p>Leopard geckos have large, round eyes that make them very cute, curious-looking pets. Unfortunately, they frequently suffer from eye ailments, most of which are due either to poor husbandry or environmental factors.</p><p>It's important that you're able to recognize a developing eye problem in your gecko so that you can provide the appropriate care and understand when to contact your exotics vet for help. However, you can prevent many eye issues altogether by maintaining optimal conditions in your pet's habitat.</p><h2>Why Do Leopard Geckos Have Eye Issues? </h2><p>Leopard geckos' eyes are large in proportion to the size of their heads. This is one reason why they tend to get things stuck in their eyes, develop abscesses or infections, and generally have more ocular problems than other animals. Otherwise, they may have congenital issues or some aspect of their diet or environment may be lacking.</p><h2>Foreign Bodies </h2><p>A foreign body is something in your leopard gecko's eye that shouldn't be there. This could be a piece of gravel or bedding, food, retained skin, or anything else that isn't normally found around an eyeball. The material can get stuck or lodged in the eye socket and cause a variety of issues if it's not removed promptly.</p><h2>Eye Abscesses </h2><p>The actual eye may be punctured, become infected, or develop an abscess. More commonly, the area directly under the eye swells due to an abscess from a wound that doesn't involve the eyeball.</p><p>You'll be able to identify an abscess if you notice a bump under your leopard gecko's eye that suddenly appeared. This abscess could be because of a cricketormealworm bite, or your pet may have scratched itself on a branch or other object in its tank. Sometimes geckos that live together fight, and any resulting wound may cause an abscess to form.</p><h2>Eye Ulcers </h2><p>When a foreign body gets stuck in the eye or the eyeball suffers some other trauma, an ulcer may form. This happens when the cornea (the clear outer coating of the eye) is damaged. An ulcer is a hole or tear in the cornea, which may be small or very large.</p><p>Eye ulcers are very painful. If your gecko has an eye ulcer, it may be holding its eye shut, trying to clean the eye with its tongue, or scratching the ulcer with its foot.</p><h2>Pinkeye </h2><p>""Conjunctivitis""is the technical name for pinkeye, an inflammation of the pink tissue that lines the lids around your gecko's eyes. This pinkish-red, fleshy part of the eye is called the ""conjunctiva,""and bacterial conjunctivitis is common in leopard geckos, who can get it from dirty water or any dirty environment that harbors bacteria. One of the primary causes of conjunctivitis in a leopard gecko is an unclean terrarium.</p><h2>Retained Eyelid Lining </h2><p>Check your gecko after it sheds its skin to be sure it also shed its eyelid lining. If the conditions in its terrarium aren't humid enough, the eyelid lining may stick to the eyelid and be retained aftershedding, which can lead to an infection.</p><h2>Eye Proptosis </h2><p>Proptosis is probably the worst type of eye issue a leopard gecko can have. However, it's also the least common. Proptosis means the eyeball actually comes out of the eye socket. Really the only way this can occur to a leopard gecko is if it's squeezed so hard that its eye pops out.</p><h2>Blindness </h2><p>Sometimes leopard geckos are blind due to congenital issues, but other times trauma or other situations may cause blindness. Regardless of the reason, leopard geckos should be okay without their sight.</p><p>You may need to help a blind leopard geckoeat, since it could have a difficult time catching moving food such as crickets. Otherwise, a blind gecko can easily live out its life in a regular enclosure without issues.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Since leopard geckos can have such a wide variety of eye issues, treatment depends on the problem. Quite often, these matters are serious and your exotics vet will need to diagnose the issue and prescribe treatment. Sometimes you'll need to handle follow-up treatment at home.</p><p>Foreign bodies: By using cotton-tipped applicators, saline rinse, and sometimes eye lubrication, your vet should be able to remove an irritating foreign body from the affected eye. Occasionally, when the foreign body is too difficult to remove or the leopard gecko won't open its eye, light sedation or anesthesia may be necessary. This will relax your gecko and allow your vet to work more quickly without accidentally damaging the animal's eye.</p><p>If you attempt to remove an item from your leopard gecko's eye, be extremely gentle and cautious. Try rinsing the eye with a sterile, preservative-free saline eye rinse while you gently restrain your gecko.</p><p>Just be very careful not to hurt your gecko or stress it out enough to cause it to drop its tail, which is also stressful to your pet. If you have any doubts about your ability to do this correctly, it's best to take your gecko to the vet rather than cause it any further harm or pain.</p><p>Abscesses: Regardless of the reason for an abscess, your vet will need to drain it and clean it out. She may use a scalpel or a needle to open it and then gently remove the infected material. Depending on how bad the area around the eye is, your vet may send you home with eye drops, pain medications, anti-inflammatories, and/or antibiotics.</p><p>Ulcers: To diagnose a corneal ulcer, your exotics vet will use a special eye stain or topical fluorescein dye that sticks to the ulcer if one is present. She will then use a black light to identify the ulcer on the surface of the cornea.</p><p>If she finds an ulcer, your vet will prescribe special eye drops and your gecko will need to be rechecked in a few weeks to make sure the ulcer is going away. There are no home remedies for an eye ulcer.</p><p>Pinkeye: Because conjunctivitis in leopard geckos is typically caused by bacteria, treatment often requires an antibiotic eye drop or ointment.</p><p>Retained eyelid lining: Never attempt to remove a retained eyelid lining yourself. This is a job for an experienced veterinarian only.</p><p>Proptosis: If proptosis occurs, the eyeusually has to be removed by your exotics vet.</p><h2>How to Prevent Eye Issues </h2><p>Being proactive can prevent a number of eye issues and help to keep your leopard gecko safe and healthy.</p>",1091
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/guide-to-geckos-1236898,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>A Guide to Pet Geckos</h1>,"<h1>A Guide to Pet Geckos</h1><p>Geckos are usually small to medium sized lizards that are native to the warmer parts of the world. There are over 1,600 different species of geckos but not all of them are commonly kept as pets. The geckos that are most often kept as pets are usually under a foot long and have lifespans between 10 and 20 years. Because of their small size and long lifespan, geckos have become very popular pets but their care can still vary some between species.</p><h2>Popular Pet Gecko Species </h2><p>There are of course many other types of geckos both in the wild and as pets but these other species are not as commonly seen as the aforementioned.</p><h2>Choosing a Gecko </h2><p>If you want a pet gecko, it's best to acquire a captive-bred one from a reputable breeder. If you take in a wild-caught gecko you won't know what diseases or ailments it may be carrying.Look for a gecko that has clear eyes, skin without dry patches, all its fingers, toes, and its tail, as well as a healthy appetite.</p><h2>Gecko Behavior </h2><p>Even though there are many kinds of geckos, some of them have similar temperaments and exhibit similar behaviors. For the most part, geckos are pleasant, docile pets but most of them prefer not to be handled by humans too frequently as it can be stressful for them.</p><h2>Housing a Gecko </h2><p>Care requirements will vary some from species to species but for the most part, geckos need to be kept in enclosures that have branches available for climbing, a water bowl, a hiding place, and secure lids. Geckos can escape through small holes so an aquarium with a tight fitting lid is recommended for housing geckos. Most geckos only require a 10 or 20 gallon aquarium since they are small reptiles but larger species will need more space.</p><p>To line your gecko's cage, use a substrate such as coconut husk or orchid bark, both of which retain moisture and will not be harmful to your gecko if ingested in small amounts. Paper towels and newspaper can also be used but some concerns with the bleaching and dying of these paper products lead reptile owners to more natural options.</p><h2>Heatingand Humidity for Geckos </h2><p>The ideal temperature range for most geckos is between 70 and 90 degrees but some require higher basking temperature areas into the 100's. These high temperatures are achieved through the use of heat lights and heating pads. A proper temperature gradient should be provided in the appropriate temperature range for the specific species of gecko you are caring for. This typically means one side of the enclosure will be in the 70's while the other side will be in the 90's or 100's.</p><p>For nocturnal species, no UVB-emitting bulbs are typically necessary but gecko species that are active during the day will need this special light. UVB rays are invisible but very important to the growth, appetite, and activity of many reptiles.</p><p>Many different kinds of bulbs exist for UVB, heat, and light and some may be more appropriate for your specific kind of gecko than others. But regardless of what bulbs you choose, a proper day and night cycle should be followed to illuminate the enclosure. White light, even if it isn't providing heat or UVB rays, needs to be visible during the day or your gecko may become stressed and confused.</p><p>Humidity in a gecko's enclosure should be kept between 70 and 80 percent. Misting the enclosure with water is the most common method of achieving this percentage but providing a large water bowl will also help. A hygrometer can be used to measure how humid a gecko enclosure is.</p><h2>Feeding Geckos </h2><p>Most geckos do not eat plants or vegetables so live insects are something you must be comfortable with if you want to have a gecko. There are several insect options and some are preferred by different gecko species over the others.</p><p>Crickets and mealworms are usually the staple diets of geckos with the superworms and waxworms being more of a treat. Some gecko species do eat fruit and they are often given a formulated diet to meet their specific nutritional needs. Feeding regimens will vary based on the age and species of the gecko and may be daily or weekly.</p><p>Prior to feeding a gecko, the insects must be fed a nutritious diet. This will gut-load the insects so that they can provide better nutrition to the gecko. Calcium powder should also be dusted onto the insects intermittently to supplement the gecko with this mineral.</p><h2>Handling Geckos </h2><p>Never grab a gecko by the tail as they will often drop their tails (a natural defense against predators). However, if this should happen there is no need to panic. It will grow back although it may have a different shape and/or color. The gecko should be well fed and ideally separated from any cage mates until the tail has regrown.</p><h2>Common Gecko Health Problems </h2><p>Geckos are not immune to health problems.</p><p>Edited by Adrienne Kruzer, RVT</p><p>Geckos lives from six to 10 years.</p><p>Difference geckos have different price points. Common house geckos cost about $10. Leopard geckos, for example, start at around $15 and go up to the thousands. They are geckos for every price point.</p><p>Geckos do not love to be petted or handled. They tolerate it, if you're gentle.</p>",885
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-gecko-substrate-1238760,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Choosing a Leopard Gecko Substrate</h1>,"<h1>Choosing a Leopard Gecko Substrate</h1><p>Choosing a substrate can be one of the more confusing aspects of setting up a tank for leopard geckos. There is much debate over which substrates are safe and best for your specific age and size of a gecko.</p><p>Paper towels, though not as attractive in a terrarium as some other options, are one of the most popular substrates available. For juveniles and hatchlings (under a year old), paper towels may be your best choice as a substrate. For adults, there are more choices available to you, but with all the recommendations, making a decision can be confusing. Here's a rundown of some options you have to choose from (and some to avoid).</p><h2>Paper Towels </h2><p>As mentioned previously, paper towels are one of the best substrates for juvenile leopard geckos (as well as sick geckos), but they can also be used for an adult leopard gecko. With paper towels, there are no worries about ingestion or inhalation of a substrate and they are very absorbent, hygienic, and easy to clean, which reduces the chance of illness. It also makes monitoring health (e.g. eating, bowel movements) easy.</p><p>The downside to paper towels is that your gecko cannot burrow in them, and they are not natural to their native habitats. If your gecko doesn't like to burrow and you aren't worried about a natural-looking environment, consider paper towels as a substrate for your leopard gecko.</p><h2>Sand </h2><p>Sand is where the debate over substrates gets heated. Sand is considered unsafe by some, due to the risk of ingestion and impaction (either due to accidental ingestion or intentional ingestion to meet calcium needs). Sand ingestion is a bigger risk for juveniles, so sand is not usually recommended tobe used with juvenile geckos. Other potential difficulties with sand include dust, which can lead to respiratory problems, and bacterial or mold growth in wet sand. Still, some keepers prefer sand as a substrate due to the ease of scooping the waste out of it, the natural look, and the ability leopard geckos have to burrow their bodies in it.</p><p>Healthy adult, properly supplementedgeckos are less likely to ingest sand. If you choose sand, only use it with healthy adult geckos (never juvenile geckos or sick geckos). Choose a fine-grained sand. To decrease the chances of ingestion, feed your gecko in another enclosure with a paper towel to reduce sand particle ingestion. Calcium-based sand is claimed to be digestible, but it is digested too slowly to be considered a fail-safe option. Any type of sand ingested can lead to bowel impaction which will result in a visit to the vet, if not even surgery with them. Provide calcium in the means of a multivitamin to help meet calcium needs (to prevent MBD).</p><p>Feeding prey items in a dish can also reduce the chance of ingestion. If sand starts appearing in bowel movements, you should stop using sand immediately since this is an indicator that your gecko is ingesting it. Also, monitor for signs of obstruction, which indicate the need for an urgent visit to a vet. These signs include a decreased appetite, a decrease in bowel movements, lethargy, and dark spots on the abdomen (impacted sand in the bowels seen through the skin).</p><h2>Paper </h2><p>Like paper towels, paper sheets are simple but safe and make it easy to clean your leopard gecko's cage. You can get brown butcher paper or unprinted newsprint quite economically and just replace the substrate when it is soiled.</p><p>Shredded paper beddings are also available and are typically safe for leopard geckos to burrow in. They don't often ingest paper bedding, but if they do, the paper used gets very soft and should pass through your gecko without an issue.</p><h2>Indoor/Outdoor or Reptile Carpet </h2><p>This is also easy to clean and carries little risk of ingestion (watch for loose threads that could possibly be ingested or trap a leg), but some carpets can be a bit rough for gecko skin(monitor your leopard gecko's belly for any redness). Keep two pieces on hand to make cleaning easier. When one is soiled, remove it for a thorough cleaning and replace it with the second piece. When the soiled one is disinfected and dry, you can just swap them out again).</p><h2>Prepackaged Reptile Bedding </h2><p>There are a variety of reptile bedding products available and some people use these with geckos. Some consist of small particles that could be ingested with feeding and many experts advise against them. If you choose such a substrate, take the same precautions as with sand. Crushed shells and nuts are not good options for this reason, but substrates like a dirt mix or wood chips come with their own concerns. Large pieces can impale your gecko or get stuck in their mouth.</p><h2>Slate Rocks </h2><p>Some owners use slate rocks set into a small amount of sand to anchor them and fill the spaces between the rocks. If you can get smooth flat stones, this seems like a good option for making a naturalistic environment that holds and distributes heat well without much risk of ingesting substrate. The amount of sand between the stones is less likely to be a problem than an open area of sand.</p><h2>Substrates to Always Avoid </h2><p>Wood chips, wood shavings, corn cob, walnut shells, and gravel are not appropriate choices for leopard geckos. As stated before, these substrate options come with a variety of risks.</p><h3>Watch Now: Pet LizardTop Names and Fascinating Facts</h3><p>Pet Reptiles Need Vitamin D and Calcium for Bone Health.</p>",908
41,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-gecko-morphs-1239170,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Types of Leopard Gecko Morphs</h1>,"<h1>Types of Leopard Gecko Morphs</h1><p>Leopard geckos come in a variety of color mutations. Many pet owners are familiar with the common yellow color with black spots, but it's also possible to choose geckos with morphs that can have different spots, stripes, and distinctive colors on their skin.</p><h3>What Is a Leopard Gecko Morph?</h3><p>Leopard gecko morphs refer to the different visual looks of the same breed of gecko. Selective breeding can create morphs that variate the leopard gecko's color and patterns of its skin or sometimes change the size and shape of its physical features.</p><p>Morph prices will vary from color to color, and enthusiasts can find unique morphs of the leopard gecko breed to raise as pets. There are currently more than 100 different color morphs and combinations. Check out this list of some of the more commonly seen morphs.</p><h3>6 Ways a Leopard Gecko Can Stand Out from the Crowd</h3><h2>Normal (Wild Type) </h2><p>This is your basic yellow leopard gecko with black spots. They will be inexpensive and very common in pet stores and photos depicting leopard geckos. Don't pay a lot of money for a Normal morph seeing as they are readily available.</p><h2>High Yellow </h2><p>Before there were over 100 different color morphs there was just High Yellow. You either had a Normal or you had the High Yellow morph of the leopard gecko, nothing else. The High Yellow has more yellow and fewer spots than the Normal morph and you can have a combination High Yellow with another morph such as Jungle.</p><h2>Aberrant </h2><p>An Aberrant leopard gecko is one that has a broken pattern, meaning if your gecko has beautiful bands all down its body and tail but there is a break in the pattern where an oval appears instead of a line you have an Aberrant. You can also have a combination Aberrant with other morphs.</p><h2>Blizzard </h2><p>This is a completely patternless leopard gecko and is very similar to the Murphy Patternless. Blizzards can be all white, yellow, or even a purple color with the darker colors being referred to as Midnight Blizzards. Blizzards are one of the three morphs that also have eclipsed, or completely black, eyes.</p><h2>Hypo Melanistic </h2><p>To be considered a Hypo a leopard gecko must have 10 or fewer spots on its body (some on the head and tail are allowed). If a leopard gecko has no spots on its body at all it is considered a Super Hypo.</p><h2>Tangerine </h2><p>The Tangerine morph is any leopard gecko that has orange on it. Another morph, Super Hypo Tangerine, has no black spotting anywhere on the body and a tail that is paler than the rest of the lizard.</p><h2>Carrot Tail </h2><p>This morph description is specific to the tail. A leopard gecko that has at least 15% of its tail covered in orange is described as a Carrot Tail.</p><h2>RAPTOR (Red-Eyed Albino Patternless Tremper Orange) </h2><p>The RAPTOR is an albino leopard gecko with red eyes and a yellowish-orange body. RAPTOR morphs will have no black spots and are considered combination morphs.</p><h2>Halloween Mask </h2><p>The Halloween Mask morph has bold head patterns. Their patterns and traits will continue to develop as they mature into adults.</p><h2>Lavender </h2><p>As the name suggests, the Lavender morph describes any leopard gecko with the light violet or lavender color on it. Many geckos lose their lavender coloration as they get older which can make breeding for this morph very difficult.</p><h2>Hyper Melanistic </h2><p>A Hyper Melanistic is a darkly pigmented, but not black, leopard gecko. This morph has more melanin than the lighter pigmented morphs. It will still have spots and patterns but overall have a much darker coloration than Normal or Wild Types.</p><h2>Reverse Stripe </h2><p>This morph describes a leopard gecko that has a stripe all the way down his back, from his neck to his tail. The color of the stripe will vary but the Reverse Stripe description will be used in conjunction with other morph names.</p><h2>Super Giant </h2><p>While the majority of morphs describe skin coloration or the eyes of a leopard gecko Super Giant is referencing the size of the gecko. Super Giants are the largest of the leopard geckos with an almost 12-inch gecko holding the record. Giants are bigger than Normals but smaller than Super Giants.</p><h2>Baldy </h2><p>This is a type of Super Hypo that has no spotting on its head.</p><p>Other types of morphs also exist and while the combinations of them seem endless there are breeders who have this down to an exact science and are currently working on new morphs. Prices will vary from morph to morph depending on how difficult it is to produce but expect to pay a few hundred dollars for some of the more rare morphs. If you aren't sure what morph is your favorite a great place to view a variety of them is at your local reptile show.</p>",794
42,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-leopard-geckos-need-uvb-5186413,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>Do Leopard Geckos Need UVB?</h1>,"<h1>Do Leopard Geckos Need UVB?</h1><p>The leopard gecko is one of the most popular types of pet reptiles, especially for beginner reptile owners and children. They are typically fairly hardy lizards, docile, have attractive colors and patterns, don't take up a lot of space, are quiet, and are easily handled. These qualities also make them a favorite among seasoned herpetologists, too. But while leopard geckos have a reputation for being easy to care for, they still have specific environmental needs. Heat and lighting elements, including UVB lights, are necessary for many reptiles, so it's important to know exactly what leopard geckos need to thrive.</p><h2>Leopard Gecko Lifestyle </h2><p>Leopard geckos are nocturnal reptiles that are native to Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Iran, and neighboring regions where they enjoy warm, dry, rocky deserts and eating insects. They spend their time cooling off in the shade during the day and sleeping in burrows. Right before sunset and sunrise, these small lizards become more active and begin to hunt for food since the temperatures are cooler. This means they do not spend much time in the sun but still need to maintain their body temperature from the warm ambient air. In captivity, leopard geckos are not much for basking under a light since they are not diurnal, but they still need warm homes like they would find in the wild.</p><h2>What Lighting Do Leopard Geckos Need? </h2><p>Since leopard geckos are nocturnal, they do not appear to need UVB lighting like many other reptiles do but some research shows it may be of benefit nonetheless. Juvenile leopard geckos that were exposed to low levels of UVB rays during the first six months of their lives were found to have higher vitamin D3 levels than those that were not exposed. Both groups of geckos were given vitamin D3 in their diets and neither group had an apparent negative or positive effect from getting or not getting the UVB rays. More research needs to be done to determine whether these higher vitamin D3 levels in the body are of benefit in other ways such as immune support or bone density.</p><p>Whether or not you choose to provide UVB lighting to your leopard gecko, you should always provide heat lights and some sort of white light on a 12 hour cycle. The heat lights should provide an ambient temperature gradient between 78 and 90 degrees during the day and the enclosure should not be allowed to drop below 70 degrees at night. The white light can be a simple incandescent or fluorescent bulb if the heat light does not emit white light. This is to mimic the natural day/night cycle for your gecko's behavior patterns.</p><h2>How Do You Give Leopard Geckos UVB? </h2><p>If you want to provide UVB rays to your leopard gecko, the best way is to use a special reptile bulb. vitamin D3 and calcium should still be administered to your leopard gecko either in the gut load that its food eats or as a dusting on the insects themselves, but UVB will help your gecko absorb them.</p><p>UVB bulbs will emit invisible rays when they are on but they need to be placed at an appropriate distance from your leopard gecko and without anything blocking them. UVB lights should be placed about 18 inches from where your leopard gecko sits and be turned on for between two and 12 hours each day. Be sure there is no glass or plastic between the light and your gecko as this will block the beneficial rays. Even a mesh screen can block a portion of the UVB rays, so ideally there is nothing between the light and your pet, although this is not always possible. It's also important not to place the light too close to your gecko or leave it on for too long. Eye and skin problems can occur, especially in lighter colored morphs, if too much UVB is received. Finally, UVB bulbs should be replaced about every 12 months to ensure the invisible rays have not been depleted.</p><h2>What Is the Difference Between UVA and UVB? </h2><p>UVA and UVB are two different wavelengths of light that are invisible to humans and found in the sun's rays. UVA helps regulate various behaviors such as feeding and mating, while UVB helps reptiles synthesize vitamin D3 which in turn helps the body absorb calcium.</p><h2>Signs a Leopard Gecko Needs UVB </h2><p>Leopard geckos that have metabolic bone disease (MBD) will benefit from UVB exposure. Broken bones, jaw malformations, lethargy, a decrease in appetite, or bowed legs may be seen in a gecko with MBD. These signs indicate your leopard gecko may benefit from a little UVB in its life.</p>",802
43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-gecko-will-not-eat-1239174,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>What to Do if Your Leopard Gecko Stops Eating</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Leopard Gecko Stops Eating</h1><h2>How to Help Your Gecko Regain Its Appetite</h2><p>Reptiles can stop eating for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it's due to something we've done or fed them previously and other times it's because of an illness. If your leopard gecko has suddenly stopped eating but is still active, there are things you can do at home before rushing him into your vet's office.</p><h2>Why Do Leopard Geckos Stop Eating? </h2><p>Leopard geckos can lose their appetites for a variety of reasons. Most can be resolved with appropriate care or a quick trip to the exotic vet. Some, however, are tougher to handle.</p><h2>Cold Environment </h2><p>The number one reason why leopard geckos stop eating is that they are too cold. Perhaps your heat bulb burned out, perhaps the heat mat stopped working, perhaps there's a draft going into the cage, or maybe you never had a heat source for your leopard geckoand now it's just gotten too cold. The change of seasons from fall to winter often brings a lot of anorexic geckos into the animal clinic, but, more often than not, a simple fix to their environmental temperature will make them start eating again.</p><p>If your leopard gecko's metabolic rate is decreased due to temperatures dropping below 70 degrees Fahrenheit then itwill most likely stop eating. Supplemental heat is necessary if you don't keep the room where your gecko is located around 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and not many people keep their homes this warm.A heat mat works well but will not warm the air as well as it does the cage flooring, so it is hard to monitor what temperature it is where your gecko is sitting. It is much better and more cost-effective to have a simple heat light on the enclosure. This way you can properly monitor the basking temperature and make sure it isn't getting too cold in your leopard gecko's cage at night.</p><h2>Impacted Feces </h2><p>If your leopard gecko hasn't defecated recently, itmay be impacted with fecal matter. This fecal impaction could be due to a recent large or hard meal your leopard geckoate, such as super worms, or from bedding material that was accidentally ingested. Urate plugs can also cause a blockage of fecal matter. If your gecko is having these problems, try soaking it in a warm water bath twice a day. The water should be deep enough to cover your gecko's hips. While your gecko is submerged, you should gently massage its belly. If that doesn't help your gecko pass their stool and urates, you should take your gecko to a vet. Your vet may need to administer an enema to your leopard gecko, or they may discover it has intestinal parasites or needs other medical attention.</p><h2>Sickness </h2><p>If your leopard gecko recently got a chill from a draft or had a decrease in their environmental temperature, it could have a respiratory infection that has causedthem to stop eating. Respiratory infections are common in reptiles and can cause one to lose its appetite. If your leopard gecko is sick in some other way, there may be a different reason for their inappetence. Your exotics vet can diagnose growths that affect or block the intestinal tract, mouth ulcerations, and other ailments. If you suspect an illness is a reason for your gecko to not be eating, visit your exotics vet for assistance.</p><h2>Injury </h2><p>If your leopard gecko has a wound or is in pain because of an injury, itmay stop eating. Abscesses, eye injuries, tail problems, and toe problems can all be pretty uncomfortable and make your gecko not want to eat. If you know your gecko has an injury, be prepared that it may not want to eat until its pain is controlled and it is feeling better.</p><h2>Vision Problems </h2><p>Retained skin on the eyes can block your gecko's ability to see it'sfood, especially if it's trying to catch a cricket. This usually occurs after an incomplete shed and is often due to a lack of humidity in the cage. Other eye problems include corneal ulcers and retrobulbar abscesses that would cause your gecko to stop eating.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The best approach to treating lack of appetite in a leopard gecko is to examine your pet's environment, behavior, and physical appearance and make your best guess as to the problem.</p><p>Of course, your gecko may have stopped eating for a different reason than is listed, so if you've tried all the tips above with no improvement, make sure you schedule a visit to your exotics vet so they can help you figure it out.</p><h2>How to Prevent Lack of Appetite in Leopard Geckos </h2><p>While it's not possible to absolutely prevent loss of appetite, these measures can help.</p>",791
44,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-gecko-armpits-1239169,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>What to Do if Your Leopard Gecko Has Armpit Bubbles</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Leopard Gecko Has Armpit Bubbles</h1><p>How can you tell if your leopard gecko is fat? It is often hard to tell if your pet is overweight but there are a few indicators to help you know how much food is too much food.</p><p>One common and obvious indicator of a fat leopard gecko is armpit bubbles. You may have noticed these little bubbles that seem to pop up overnight. They're usually located behind one leg, and they can be very concerning if you don't know what they are.</p><h2>What Are Leopard Gecko Armpit Bubbles? </h2><p>These bubbles can contain fat, vitamins, protein, or calcium and other minerals. If you suspect your gecko is a little overweight or gets a lot of calcium, these bubbles may confirm your suspicions. An overweight leopard gecko will most likely have armpit bubbles filled with fat.</p><p>These bubbles make it look like your gecko has small air sacs or blisters in his armpits. Both male and female geckos get them.</p><p>Armpit bubbles will not hurt your leopard gecko, and you shouldn't be concerned about them. They are not painful or uncomfortable and don't cause any sort of problem for your leopard gecko. They also will not pop (nor should you try to pop them) like a blister. They are completely normal in some leopard geckos and are simply an indicator that your gecko is storing something.</p><p>Some pet owners may think these bubbles are a sign of good health and always store calcium. But many owners do notice that they disappear with weight loss. It is best to check your gecko for other signs of a weight problem to be sure.</p><h2>Other Signs of an Overweight Leopard Gecko </h2><p>A leopard gecko also stores fat in its tail. The tail should be nice and thick but not wider than the gecko's head. Its legs shouldn't turn into little sausages, and its belly shouldn't be too round. Since it can be difficult to tell if a leopard gecko is overweight, you may want to monitor your gecko's weight.</p><p>Remember that leopards eat a diet almost entirely consisting of insects. Some owners feed larger leopard geckos mealworms and even pinkie mice in addition to the standard gut-loaded crickets. If you see your gecko's weight creeping up, you may want to modify its diet: crickets only until it returns to a healthier weight.</p><p>A gram scale can help you record weekly weights which will, in turn, help you notice any upward (or downward) trends in your gecko's weight.</p><h2>How to Prevent Armpit Bubbles </h2><p>The armpit bubbles on a leopard gecko may come and go. Sometimes they pop up overnight and then are gone after a day or two, while at other times, they stick around for weeks or even longer. Sometimes they may seem larger than at other times, or one may stay while the other disappears from the other armpit.</p><p>An overweight leopard gecko may hang on to these bubbles longer if they're filled with fat, but there is no way for you to know what they're storing unless they're sampled by your exotics vet and sent to a lab for analysis.</p><p>If the bubbles disappear, they may or may not come back. If your gecko does not have excess fat or other nutrients, then it has no reason to store anything in its armpits.</p><p>Malnourished and underweight geckos don't have these bubbles since they're most likely lacking in all the things that these bubbles would likely contain.You can ask your vet to perform blood work to monitor your gecko's calcium levels if you're concerned that you're not giving it enough or are giving it too much of the mineral, but it may be that these bubbles are a good sign that you're providing adequate calcium in your gecko's diet.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If you suspect that what you're seeing on your gecko isn't normal or are not storage bubbles, don't hesitate to make an appointment with your exotics vet.</p><p>He will probably advise you to reduce the amount of calcium in your gecko's diet or recommend you stop dusting its prey with calcium. You also may want to reduce the number of gut-loaded insects you feed your gecko until the bubbles disappear.</p><p>Leopard geckos can get abscesses that look similar to the bubbles from mealworm and cricket bites, thermal burns from being too close to their heat lights, from sitting too long on a hot rock, and other sources.</p><p>If you're not sure whether it's an abscess or a bubble, bring your gecko to the vet. Abscesses can be very painful and need to be treated.</p><p>If your gecko ever stops eating for longer than a week, hasn't defecated for awhile, or seems lethargic, make an appointment with your vet to get your gecko checked out.</p>",791
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/leopard-gecko-habitat-5199607,Reptiles & Amphibians > Geckos,<h1>How to Build a Favorable Habitat For Your Leopard Gecko</h1>,"<h1>How to Build a Favorable Habitat For Your Leopard Gecko</h1><p>Leopard geckos are very popular pet reptiles for both kids and adults. They're small, quiet, colorful, and easy to handle but like other reptiles, they do require appropriate habitats in order to thrive. By providing your leopard gecko with an appropriately sized enclosure, the correct substrate, lighting, and accessories, you'll not only give your gecko what it needs, but also what it wants.</p><h2>Leopard Geckos in the Wild </h2><p>Leopard geckos are native to Afghanistan, India, Pakistan, Iran, and Nepal. Here, they live in dry deserts and grassland areas made up of rocky terrain and sandy soil. They can be found in rock crevices or if it gets too cold, underground in a burrow where they can enter semi-hibernation. Despite popular belief, leopard geckos don't enjoy extremely hot temperatures and sand but will instead hang out in the shade during the day. They are also more often found in desert areas with a clay or gravel mix in the soil rather than strictly sand. To create the best habitat for a leopard gecko, you'll want to try and mimic these attributes as closely as possible.</p><h2>Leopard Gecko Enclosures </h2><p>While some leopard gecko owners have beautiful, custom-made, open-top enclosures, if you have children or other pets in your household, it is safer to have a terrarium with a screen lid. Leopard geckos cannot climb walls but a lid will them from curious cats, dogs, or birds as well as children who may accidentally hurt them.</p><p>A plastic or glass aquarium is commonly used for housing reptiles and is what is recommended for leopard geckos. For one leopard gecko, a minimum of a 10 gallon tank is usually sufficient, especially when it is young, but a 20-gallon long tank is more ideal. If you opt for the preferred 20 gallon tank over the 10-gallon tank, be sure to get the long version and not the high or tall varieties. Leopard geckos need more ground space than height in their enclosures and the long version offers just that. A fitted screened lid placed on top will allow good airflow while still protecting your pet. If you decide to house multiple geckos, a larger tank will be necessary.</p><h2>Leopard Gecko Habitat Substrate</h2><p>To make your leopard gecko habitat as natural as possible, large rocks, gravel, and bioactive soil designed for reptiles should be used as substrate. If you prefer to have a less natural but easier to clean substrate, you can use sheets of paper, recycled paper bedding designed for hamsters, or reptile carpet instead. Sand is not recommended since it can be easily consumed and cause an impaction, especially for young and small leopard geckos.</p><h2>Leopard Gecko Habitat Lighting </h2><p>Many pet reptiles require high air temperatures and high levels of UVB rays but leopard geckos aren't like many other pet reptiles. Leopard geckos are nocturnal reptiles so they spend most of the daylight hours sleeping. This means they don't get much natural exposure to UVB lighting like reptiles that spend time in the sun receive. Some research shows that UVB lighting may be beneficial to some leopard geckos but most do not require it. Because of this, UVB bulbs are considered to be optional for leopard geckos. If you choose to provide a UVB light, be sure it is a low wattage one.</p><p>Despite not needing much, if any, UVB, leopard geckos do need warm air temperatures in their habitats. Having a heat light is the best way to ensure your gecko's enclosure doesn't get too cold but you'll want to use a thermometer to ensure it also doesn't get too warm. You can let the enclosure drop to about 70 degrees at night without the light but during the day, make sure it doesn't go above 90 degrees directly under the light where your leopard gecko would sit.</p><h2>Leopard Gecko Habitat Accessories </h2><p>A hide of some sort is the most important accessory in your leopard gecko's enclosure and the item it will use the most. You can create a hide (or burrow) for your gecko using large rocks, a plastic food container turned upside down with a door cut out, or you can purchase one designed for reptiles from the pet store. It is best to offer your leopard gecko a few hide options with at least one on the side of the tank with the heat light and the other on the opposite end. During a shed, providing wet paper towels or moss in one of these hides can help with any shedding issues. A bowl for water, a small plate or dish for calcium powder, and a log or rocks to climb on are the only other necessary accessories for your leopard gecko's habitat.</p>",784

She is a member of the International Association of Animal Behavior Consultants. Kayla also works with cats and birds, including falcons and homing pigeons.</p><p>Before you bring home a new little gecko, it's important to know what to feed your pet. Like most lizards, geckos are predators that prefer to eat a variety of insects. The exact type of insects, feeding schedule, supplements, and amount of food will vary based on your gecko's species, age, and activity level.</p><h2>General Pet Gecko Food Guidelines </h2><p>Most geckos do best eating live prey. Unlike dogs and cats, geckos don't generally do well eating pre-packaged kibble or prepared food. That means you'll need to purchase or breed live insects to feed your gecko.</p><p>Some species of pet gecko eat fruit as well as insects. These geckos can eat pureed fruit mixes or prepared fruit mixes formulated for geckos. However, most pet geckos are primarily insectivorous, meaning they eat insects and other creepy crawlies. African fat-tailed geckos, house geckos, and leopard geckos are all purely insectivorous. Crested geckos and day geckos, however, are frugivorous. That means they eat fruit.</p><h2>What to Feed Your Gecko </h2><p>Feed your insectivorous geckos a variety of insects. Relying too heavily on one type of insect will not give your gecko a complete diet.</p><p>You might find that it's easier in the long term to raise your own crickets and insects for your geckos. Regardless, a good setup for storing insects will help you avoid going to the pet store to purchase them every few days.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>It's best to avoid feeding your pet gecko wild insectsyou just don't know which ones might be toxic or covered in harmful chemicals from the outdoors.</p><p>Day geckos eat a mixture of the insects listed above, especially crickets, and gecko diet mix. Similarly, crested geckos generally eat a mix of insects and powdered crested gecko food.</p><h3>Priming Your Gecko's Prey</h3><p>Be sure to gut-load your gecko's insects before offering them to him. This simply means feeding the insects an extra-nutritious diet for 24 hours before feeding them to your pet, so that your gecko gets all of the nutritional benefits! Most pet stores will sell a prepared diet to gut load your insects. Otherwise, a high-quality mix of fruits, veggies, and grains will do the trick. You can also dust your insects with a nutritious powder purchased at a pet store.</p><p>Feed your frugivorous gecko fruits like grapes, apricots and apples. Puree the fruit or chop it into pieces that are smaller than the space between your gecko's eyes. Pieces that are too big can be dangerous for your pet! You can purchase prepared fruit mixes for day geckos and crested geckos, making things a bit easier. In fact, most new gecko owners shouldn't try to make their own fruit mix for their geckos. It's just too tricky to track your gecko's calcium and other health factors when you're a new gecko owner.</p><h2>How Much and When to Feed Your Gecko </h2><p>Most geckos are nocturnal, so it's best to feed them at night. Otherwise, they might not be awake or hungry for feeding time!</p><p>Young geckos should eat every day. As they mature, most adult geckos do the best eating every other day. All geckos should have constant access to clean, fresh water. Misting the tank regularly will give your gecko the humidity he requires.</p><p>The amount of food that your gecko needs will vary based on his age and activity level. Feed him as much as he'll eagerly eat within a few minutes. You don't want to put too many insects in his cage, as they may escape, die and rot, or tempt your gecko into overeating. Simply introduce a one or two insects at a time, slowing down as your gecko's eagerness to eat wanes. Some geckos will happily eat from long tweezers, which can make it easier to control how many insects you put into his cage.</p><p>Be sure to clear out any uneaten fruit mix or insects after your gecko is done eating. Both fruit and insects can rot, creating an unclean environment for your pet.</p>",697

Some of the most common reptiles you will see in a pet store are some of the most difficult ones to care for. Before getting into specific care issues, though, let's discuss more general issues that should be considered before deciding on a pet reptile.</p><h2>Finding out If a Pet Is Legal Where You Live </h2><p>Some are general and some are quite specific but many areas have enacted laws pertaining to keeping exotic reptiles as pets. In many places any reptiles that are considered dangerous (venomous snakes, alligators, etc.) are illegal, but some places are even more restrictive (such as all constricting snakes). The first step in deciding on whether a reptile is a right pet for you is finding out whether you can even have one where you live.</p><h2>Salmonella Risks and Prevention </h2><p>All reptile owners need to be informed about infections. The risks shouldn't keep most people from keeping reptiles since with the proper management and hygiene they are minimal, but the U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that certain risk groups should be careful about contact with reptiles and amphibians.</p><h2>The Importance of Light and Heat </h2><p>Many problems with keeping reptiles can be traced back to not providing the proper environmental conditions, particularly heat. Providing proper heat and light to captive reptiles is often quite expensive but is absolutely essential to keeping pet reptiles healthy. It is important to find out exactly what conditions your reptile needs, and never cut corners when it comes to providing those conditions!</p><h2>Why Choose Captive Bred Reptiles </h2><p>Captive-bred reptiles are usually healthier, legally bred, and by purchasing them from a supplier (whether it is a breeder or pet store), you know you won't be contributing to depleting the wild population of the species.</p><h2>How to Pick a Healthy Reptile </h2><p>It is important to keep in mind that depending on where you get a reptile it may be very stressed, dehydrated, and prone to illness. There are some things you can look for in your potential reptiles to make sure you aren't buying an unhealthy pet.</p><h2>Mixing Species in a Terrarium </h2><p>Though it can be tempting to try and set up your own mini-ecosystem, there is just not enough space in a typical home enclosure to keep them all safe and provide them with the best habitats for their species.</p><h2>Lizards </h2><p>As a basic rule, only certain lizards are good for beginners. Many species have fairly complex care requirements for their heating, lighting, and diet. Some are quite delicate and difficult to care for, and others get quite large and aggressive. There are a few species that are quite hardy and easy to tame and these are the best lizards for beginners.</p><p>On the other hand, some lizards are not recommended for beginners based on their more complicated care or size.</p><h2>Snakes </h2><p>There are many species of snakes that make good pets for those new to reptiles. As long as you stick to starter species they are generally quite easy to care for, feed, and tame. They do not need to eat often (although you must be prepared to feed other animals to your snake and most of them need whole prey such as mice and rats) and they do not need special ultraviolet lighting. Of course, there are dangerous species of snakes including venomous snakes and large constrictors that are definitely not suitable for beginners.</p><h2>Turtles </h2><p>Turtles are not easy or low maintenance reptiles. Generally, turtles (including the commonly found red-eared sliders) are messy, long-lived, get quite large (so they need large housing), and need exposure to ultraviolet light.</p><p>If you can deal with these factors and commit to caring for a turtle over its long life span, a turtle might be a good pet for you. By far, the most important factor in caring for a turtle is knowing the proper dietary and environmental needs of the species you choose.</p>",662

While its tail is growing back, however, there are a few things you can do to ensure it does so healthily.</p><h2>Why Do Geckos Lose Their Tails? </h2><p>You might be surprised by a tail drop if you try to grab your gecko by the tail or hold it too tightly when it's trying to escape.The detached tail will wiggle and twitch on the ground as though it were still connected to the gecko's body. While this can be shocking, it's important not to panic.</p><p>Losing a particular body part is a defense mechanism called that many animals use. Gecko tails are specifically designed to drop: Inside the tail is special connective tissue that creates a location where it can readily break off when needed. When this happens, the blood vessels to the tail constrict and very little blood loss occurs. This is helpful to remember if you're trying to determine whether your gecko dropped its tail or lost it due to trauma; very little blood is lost when the tail is dropped.</p><p>Eventually, a gecko regrows its tail but it may not look exactly the same. The new tail is often shorter, colored differently, and blunter at the end than the original tail.</p><p>Though it's a natural process, tail dropping puts stress on a gecko and may impact its health. It's important that you look at the circumstances that led up to it so you can try to avoid these problems in the future.</p><h2>Response to Threats </h2><p>In the wild, a gecko's tail loss serves a very good purpose. The tail's movement distracts potential predators and allows the gecko to get away, leaving the predator with nothing but the wiggling tail.</p><p>In comparison, geckos are relatively safe in captivity. It's possible, however, for geckos in a group to bully one individual, which could trigger the defense mechanism. If you have more than one gecko in an enclosure, it's a good idea to separate the potential victim from the others before it loses its tail.</p><h2>Stuck Tail </h2><p>It's possible for a gecko's tail to get stuck or trapped by something in its enclosure. Whenever you set up a new enclosure, try to avoid very tight places and any potential falling objects that could harm your gecko.</p><h2>Stress and Fear </h2><p>Both stress and fear can accompany the feeling of being threatened or bullied. Loud noises, bright lights, or other startling stimuli, for example, can also impact your gecko's well-being and potentially lead to tail dropping.</p><p>Additionally, the environmental conditions of the gecko's enclosure can be a source of stress that could lead to tail loss. To help keep your gecko at its healthiest, maintain its temperature and humidity in the optimal range. Ideally for leopard geckos, the basking area of your gecko's enclosure should be around 82-85 degrees Fahrenheit, while the cool area of the enclosure should be around 75-78 degrees Fahrenheit, and the enclosure's humidity should rest between 30 and 40 percent.</p><h2>Illness and Infection </h2><p>If no other cause can be found for your gecko's tail drop, it may be due to an illness or infection. Whether the infection directly affects the tail area or the loss is a stress-related symptom of an unrelated illness, it's best to call your vet.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Usually, geckos deal with a tail loss well on their own.</p><h2>How to Prevent Tail Dropping </h2><p>There are a few steps you can take to prevent your gecko from losing its tail.</p><p>Even under ideal conditions and with proper handling, you can't be in complete control. It's always possible that your gecko may drop its tail despite your best efforts.</p>",661

The following options will help reptile owners choose the best bedding for their reptile and understand why not all bedding types are equally appropriate.</p><h2>Wood Bedding </h2><p>Bedding made from wood comes in different forms, sizes, types of wood, and even colors. The most common types of wood that are used to make bedding are pine, cedar, douglas fir, aspen, and cypress. These wood varieties will then come in the form of shavings, pellets, or chips to use as bedding.</p><p>Wood beddings are popular for many types of reptiles, including Savannah monitors. Some concerns with wood shavings, pellets, and bark chips are the lack of absorbency and odor control as well as the damage some products can cause to the feet of reptiles.</p><p>Some companies dye their shavings different colors or infuse them with chlorophyll. Besides staining the reptile the color of the bedding, these dyes don't do much for odor control or absorbency.</p><h2>Recycled Paper Bedding </h2><p>This bedding isn't always marketed to the reptile community, but many owners like the high level of absorbency that the small pellets and soft pieces of recycled paper have. Of course you won't find a Savannah monitor on paper bedding in the wild, so in that sense, it isn't a natural substrate for them. But, they do seem to like the soft texture of the paper.</p><h2>Coconut Fiber Bedding </h2><p>The stringy fiber pieces on the outside of a coconut, also known as the husk, are yet another choice for Savannah monitor bedding. Coconut fiber is often sold in expandable bricks or bags of loose material and is popular with reptiles who enjoy high humidity environments. The gardening industry also sells a variety, but it often has fertilizer in it that can harm reptiles and should be avoided.</p><p>Odor control and absorbency are good with this bedding, and burrowing reptiles especially enjoy coconut fiber.</p><h2>Alfalfa Meal Bedding </h2><p>Alfalfa meal is ground up alfalfa hay which is then compressed into small cylindrical pellets, just like pelleted rabbit food. These pellets are quite absorbent and some manufacturers add reptile-safe germ control agents to the meal. The pellets are also biodegradable, help with odor control, and should be fairly safe if accidentally ingested. They can be easily kicked around by a heavy Savannah monitor though and are not very soft.</p><h2>Paper Towels and Newspaper </h2><p>Paper towels and newspaper are inexpensive types of bedding. Some reptile owners shred the towels and newspapers to create a ""fluffier"" type of bedding, which is good for burrowers, and others just put sheets down on the bottom of the enclosure.</p><p>Paper towels and newpapers are absorbent but do nothing for odor control. Owners like the high availability, low cost, ease of clean-up, and lack of possible ingestion. The paper towels and newspaper gets the job done but do not allow a Savannah monitor to dig, so you would need a second substrate in another part of the enclosure. These substrates are not good options if your enclosure struggles with low humidity, though, as they do not help retain moisture.</p><h2>Reptile Carpet </h2><p>Colors and textures vary but most reptile carpets are washable, and this is their main draw. Some stores will cut carpets to match tank sizes, others are pre-cut and sold for specific enclosure measurements. There is no risk of ingestion and being able to wash them keeps the enclosure sanitary, but it definitely isn't a natural substrate for a Savannah monitor, much less any reptile. There is also no opportunity to burrow into a carpet, and little is done to aid in moisture retention if you need to increase the humidity in the enclosure. If you use reptile carpeting in part of your monitor enclosure be sure to also provide something that your lizard can also dig in.</p><h2>Sand Bedding </h2><p>Play sand, vitamin infused sand, and digestible calcium sand are all available options for reptile owners. Possible ingestion and impaction are the biggest concerns with sand for reptiles who eat on this substrate. Digestible calcium sand is okay to digest if it is in small amounts, but obviously if a reptile were to get a mouth full of any of these types of sand, impaction can occur.</p><p>Some sands are colored. and while this may add a nice touch to an enclosure, it will usually stain your Savannah monitor as well. Sand also clumps when it gets wet, sticks to wet feet, and does not help with odor control. Many owners will often mix some sand with other substrates to create desired textures and to allow their Savannah monitor to burrow.</p><h2>Vermiculite </h2><p>Vermiculite is a mineral that is used in many different ways. For reptile bedding, vermiculite is processed by heating it. When water is added it separates into many layers and expands into long worm-like pieces that break apart. These pieces are then used to retain heat and moisture. This type of bedding is great for high humidity reptiles and burrowers.</p><h2>Ground Walnut Shell Bedding </h2><p>As the name says, this substrate is made of finely ground walnut shells. It can cause impaction in young monitors, does not hold water, and has no odor control. It is easily scooped like cat litter to dispose of waste and does not clump like sand bedding. It is also very easily kicked around an enclosure, so it can be difficult to keep contained in one area or clean. It can, however, be great for a digging area for Savannah monitors.</p><h2>Moss Bedding </h2><p>There are a few different moss varieties used as bedding for reptiles, all of which are good for those that are small and prefer to burrow in a very humid environment. This type of substrate is not ideal for a Savannah monitor as it would be very expensive to line an entire enclosure with and holds far too much moisture than is necessary.</p><p>You may also choose to use a variety of different substrates in different parts of your enclosure. If your monitor seems to urinate and defecate in one part of the cage you may opt to use a more absorbent substrate and then use a different kind of bedding in the rest of the cage. Regardless of the kind of bedding that you choose, though, make sure it is easy to clean and non-toxic to your Savannah monitor.</p>",1064
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/handling-pet-iguanas-1236878,Reptiles & Amphibians > Monitor Lizards,<h1>How to Train Your Iguana to Be Handled</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Iguana to Be Handled</h1><p>Iguanas are beautiful lizards and can make wonderful pets, but many owners are surprised by how large, strong, and sometimes aggressive iguanas become as they mature. Pet store iguanas are likely to be at least a little stressed by their experiences of being shipped, handled, and housed. Getting an iguana from a rescue is a wonderful idea, but remember some will have been neglected and even mistreated so it may take a little longer to gain their trust.</p><p>Often a new iguana is quite docile for the first few days after he is brought home. At this point, many owners think that taming their iguana will be no problem, and are somewhat startled in a few days when the iguana starts showing signs of aggression. This is normal: At first, the iguana may have been too nervous and intimidated by his new surroundings to assert himself. However, as the iguana becomes more comfortable,he is more likely to show his displeasure with handling.</p><h2>Identify When Your Iguana Feels Threatened </h2><p>Iguanas have sharp teeth and do bite, and they may try to whip you with their tail which can be extremely powerful (and the dorsal spines along the tail are very sharp). They have sharp claws, so at least expect some scratches when first handling an iguana. It is also a good idea to acquaint yourself with body language and behaviorso you can read the warning signs. Head bobs and extension of the dewlap may signal that the iguana feels threatened and may defend itself; tail twitching is a definite sign of aggression.</p><h2>Be Patient and Predictable </h2><p>Give a new iguana a couple of weeks to settle in before starting the taming process. Establish a routine for feeding, cleaning, and handlinga predictable daily routine will provide a sense of security for the iguana.</p><h2>Talk to Your Iguana </h2><p>Talk to the iguana as you do routine tasks, and keep the iguana in a place where it can observe you going about your routine. This will help get it used to your presence. Spend time just watching and talking to the iguana. Use its name as iguanas do tend to recognize their names.</p><h2>Show Your Iguana You're in Charge </h2><p>Taming is a balance between not pushing too hard and showing the iguana who is in charge. You have to be firm and persistent without completely stressing out the iguana. At the same time, if the iguana is aggressive or struggles and you immediately back off or put it down, your iguana thinks it has ""won"" and thinks that when it is aggressive it will get its way. This may be easier said than done when an iguana is scratching you, trying to bite, or lashing you with its tail, but try to make it clear that you are making the decisions and in charge of the interaction.</p><h2>Approach and Handle Your Iguana Gently </h2><p>Place your hand in the cage and approach the iguana. Do this from the side rather than from above, which the iguana will likely perceive as a threat. If the iguana makes aggressive postures or scrambles around in a panic, back off a bit but keep trying, while speaking in a soft gentle voice. Make sure movements are slow and smooth. If you immediately stop trying, the iguana thinks it is training you. Repeat this step for a while until the iguana is more used to your hand.</p><h2>Iguana-Proof the Room </h2><p>Before attempting to handle your iguana outside of its cage, make sure the room is safe and escape-proof, with no means of getting away; block off any space, however small, an iguana could squeeze through. Make sure all breakables are put away and remember iguanas are good climbers too, so this includes top-shelf treasures. If the iguana gets away from you, this will help in the capture process.</p><h2>Pick up and Pet Your Iguana </h2><p>Now try to pet and pick up the iguana. If it is a smaller iguana, then scooping it up under the belly should be sufficient, but if it is larger, then supporting both under the belly and the pelvic (lower belly, upper tail) areas will be necessary.</p><h2>Put Down Your Iguana Only When It Is Calm </h2><p>Try not to put the iguana down until it is calm. This will help it learn that being calm is what gets it put back down rather than struggling. If the iguana gets away from you, don't panic and chase itlet it calm down, and then approach slowly speaking quietly. You may end up having to chase the iguana of course, but this is best avoided if possible. Never grab for the tailiguanas can drop their tails as a defense and you will be left holding a tail while the iguana is still on the loose.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Taming requires gaining trust, and this is something that will not happen overnighttrust must be earned over time. Regular, consistent, gentle handling is absolutely necessary to tame iguanas and keep them tame and manageable as they get larger.</p><p>As the iguana becomes more accepting of handling, you can be more responsive to its moods. If it usually accepts handling but is tense or signals with body language that it is not comfortable, then you can respect that.</p><p>To proof your iguana's behavior, you'll want to engage with it at different times of day, and in different situations. For example, you may want to bring it out of its cage during the day and at night, or when other people are around.</p><p>If another person wants to pet or hold the iguana, remind them that while your pet is tame, it may also be anxious around strangers. Have visitors take their time earning your pet's trust, and avoid allowing them to pet or hold your iguana if it seems stressed or aggressive.</p>",965
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-your-snake-is-not-eating-1238176,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes,<h1>Loss of Appetite in Snakes</h1>,"<h1>Loss of Appetite in Snakes</h1><h2>Troubleshoot your pet snake's digestive problems</h2><p>Your pet snake leads a pretty cushy life and doesn't have to evade predators or hunt for its food, but it may still develop anorexia or lose its appetite. Even if you can do a nearly perfect job of keeping your pet's environment where it should be in terms of temperature and humidity, you can't always tempt it to eat.</p><p>Of course, a snake that won't eat for a prolonged period could eventually starve to death. So you must figure out why if you notice any symptoms in addition to the anorexia or if your otherwise healthy snake refuses to eat for more than a couple of weeks.</p><h2>Why Snakes Lose Their Appetites </h2><p>In some cases, loss of appetite is a natural part of a snake's behavior, but it could also be the result of a problem that you may be able to resolve with minor adjustments to its environment or diet. If you can't figure out what's going on, it's always a good idea to pay a visit to your exotics vet.</p><h2>Natural Causes That Require No Intervention </h2><p>Your snake will lose its appetite from time to time as a natural part of its life cycle. When this happens, you won't need to take any action because your snake is perfectly healthy. It's important to remember that reptile eating habits are very different from those of mammals. It is, of course, important to monitor your snake's behavior to be sure that what appears to be a natural appetite loss isn't a sign of illness.</p><p>Molting is the most common cause of loss of appetite: your snake may stop eating when it's about to molt or shed its skin. In addition to premolt anorexia, look for your snake's skin to become very pale and dull and its eyes to look blue and milky. It may not eat for a week or so before and after it molts.</p><h2>Causes Related to Environment </h2><p>Snakes can react negatively to a variety of environmental issues that you can easily tweak.</p><h2>Monitoring Temperature </h2><p>One of the most important things to monitor with your snake is the temperature of its enclosure. Snakes need warm environments to remain active and properly digest food. If a snake gets too cold, it will become lethargic and possibly develop a variety of illnesses, including a respiratory infection or pneumonia.</p><p>Before you call your vet for an emergency ""my snake's not eating"" visit with your otherwise healthy snake, check the temperatures in his cage. What is the basking area temperature? What is the temperature of the coldest part of the cage? And how cold does it get at night? If you've answered below 70 degrees Fahrenheit to any of these questions, chances are your enclosure is too cold.</p><p>Check your references for the appropriate basking temperatures and cooler acceptable temperatures for your species of snake and make sure yours are as close to those ranges as possible. You may need to add another heat light or increase the wattage of the bulbs you are currently using. Undertank heaters are helpful for supplemental heat but don't do much in the way of ambient temperature.</p><h2>Snake Diseases That Can Cause Loss of Appetite </h2><p>There is a wide range of snake diseases that can lower your pet's appetite. Some can be easily treated while others have the potential to be deadly. Do monitor your pet to be sure you're not seeing symptoms of these disorders; if you're not sure, a visit to the vet is a good idea.</p><h2>Mouth Rot </h2><p>If you've ever had a toothache, canker sore, or have bitten your tongue when you know what it is like to have some mouth pain. Mouth rot is a painful type of mouth infection; your snake will not want to eat if it has any degree of mouth rot. If you are not sure if your snake has a healthy mouth get him in for a checkup with your exotics vet.</p><h2>Respiratory Disease </h2><p>Snakes don't want to eat if they have respiratory infections of pneumonia. If your snake is sneezing, has eye or nose drainage, or is breathing through its mouth it could have some form of respiratory disease and won't eat. Give your exotics vet a call if you suspect this.</p><h2>Intestinal Parasites </h2><p>Better known as ""worms,"" intestinal parasites are microscopic and normal in reptiles. When they become overpopulated in the intestines of your pet snake, though, it may stop eating. You won't see these parasites so you must have a fecal direct smear and a floatation performed on your snake's stool sample. Call your exotics vet to set up an appointment for a fecal screening if you haven't had one done within the last year or you suspect it could be a reason for it to stop eating.</p><h2>Obstructions and Impactions </h2><p>Sometimes snakes accidentally get a mouth full of something they can't digest and get obstructed. At other times they don't get enough moisture in their environment to defecate regularly and become impacted. Both obstruction and impaction can cause your snake to stop eating. Warm water soaks for 15 to 20 minutes twice a day may help an impacted snake pass his stool but an obstruction can require surgery to remove. Call your exotics vet if you haven't seen stool pass within a day or so of your snake's last meal or if you think he could be obstructed.</p><h2>Treatment and Prevention </h2><p>If all these elements are in place, your snake isn't molting, and you're sure that age or season is not a factor, there are many other reasons why snakes stop eating, including major organ failure and disease, systemic infections, and more. If you aren't sure why your snake has stopped eating, give your exotics vet a call. You may not be able to completely prevent your snake's loss of appetite, but careful observation of your pet along with proper management of its environment can go a long way toward helping it regain its appetite. Once your snake does start eating again, be careful not to overfeed it: overfeeding can lead to a rebounding digestive problem.</p>",1035
52,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feeding-ball-pythons-1239265,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes,<h1>How to Feed Your Pet Ball Pythons</h1>,"<h1>How to Feed Your Pet Ball Pythons</h1><p>Sonja / Pixabay / CC By 0</p><p>Ball pythons make great pet snakes for both beginner snake enthusiasts and more experienced owners who enjoy the varying color morphs. But a common concern among ball python owners everywhere is getting their pet snake to eat regularly.</p><h2>What Do Ball Pythons Eat? </h2><p>Ball pythons, like other snakes, eat varying sizes of prey depending on how big they are. Smaller and younger snakes may eat large crickets, but should ideally be eating pinkies andfuzzies until they grow larger. Adult ball pythons will eat adult mice and rats when they get big enough. Some ball python enthusiasts feel strongly that you should only feed various life stages of rats throughout your ball python's life and never offer any insects or mice.</p><h2>How Do You Know What Size Prey to Choose? </h2><p>Typically a snake will easily consume prey that is as wide as the widest part of your snake. Therefore, if the middle of his body is one inch wide, he should be able to consume a large mouse that is one inch wide without any trouble. With that being said, some snakes prefer smaller prey, and you may need to experiment with prey size to see which it prefers. Feeding prey that is too large will result in regurgitation or even the prey getting stuck in his mouth or esophagus. When in doubt, feed the smaller prey option rather than the larger one.</p><h2>How Often Should You Feed Your Ball Python? </h2><p>Your snake may be the best one to answer this question for you but typically an adult snake (over one year of age) will eat once every 10 to 14 days. Younger snakes should eat more often since they are still growing. They should eat at least once a week, or even once every 5 to 6 days while growing. If your snake doesn't want to eat weekly, it is okay to wait longer to feed him again the next time. Also, if your snake seems to be overweight (the tail should slowly taper to a point, not have an abrupt change in width from the vent to the tip), you should wait longer in between feedings to prevent obesity issues.</p><h2>Why Your Ball Python May Not Want to Eat </h2><p>Aside from major medical conditions, snakes can refuse to eat for a multitude of reasons. Being too cold is a common problem for many pet ball pythons, especially in the winter months, but is easily corrected by providing a heat light.</p><p>Intestinal parasites can cause your snake not to feel well or not gain weight. An annual fecal examination is recommended to screen your snake for a heavy burden of pinworms, coccidia, or other intestinal parasites that may need to be treated with dewormers.</p><p>If your ball python is about to shed, then it won't be eating until it is all done getting rid of the old skin. Signs your snake is about to shed include an ashy appearance to their skin and milky eyes.</p><p>Stress is an often-overlooked reason why snakes won't eat. New enclosures, other snakes in the enclosure, or too much handling can cause your ball python to get stressed out and not want to eat.</p><p>Differences in prey will also cause a picky snake to stop eating. The smell, the size, whether the prey is alive, freshly killed, or frozen and then thawed, the kind of prey, and even the color of the prey can all determine whether or not your snake is going to take in his meal.</p><h2>How to Get Your Ball Python to Eat </h2><p>If you've already explored the reasons why your ball python isn't eating (and make any possible changes including the kind of prey offered or increased temperature in the enclosure), there are some things you can do to get your snake to eat. Feed your snake in a feeding container (separate from his regular enclosure) and cover that container with a towel to prevent your snake from being distracted while he should be eating.</p><p>First, if you recently acquired your ball python and he hasn't eaten for you yet make sure you are feeding the same kind of prey item as the previous owner, pet store, or breeder where you got your snake from. Subtle changes in the prey can deter a snake from wanting to eat it.</p><p>Second, if the prey is pre-killed, ensure it is warm. You could achieve this by placing the prey in some hot water for a minute or two if it was not freshly killed.</p><p>If your ball still doesn't eat, try cutting the pre-killed prey open to expose the blood and entice your snake with the scent. Using long tongs, hemostats, or feeding forceps to dangle and wiggle the food in front of your snake can also be helpful, especially if your ball prefers eating live prey. Soaking the pre-killed prey in some warmed low or no-sodium chicken broth can help add an attractive scent to the food as well.</p><p>If you've tried all of the above tricks and your ball python still won't eat, get him checked out by an exotics vet. Your vet may recommend force-feeding depending on how old the snake is, what his body condition score is, and how long it has gone without eating. Force-feeding is simple, but you must be careful to avoid injuring your snake's fangs.</p><p>Ball pythons can grow up to five feet long.</p><p>Ball pythons can live to be 30 years old!</p><p>Look at its tail: The female ball python has a tail that tapers toward the end; the male ball python's tail remains thicker all the way to the end.</p>",975

If left untreated, mouth rot can be a very seriousnot to mention painfulcondition. The infection initially affects the soft tissue but can involve the bone in more serious situations. Because of this, it's important for you to know what mouth rot is, how to prevent it, how to recognize it, and what to do if you think your snake has it.</p><h2>What Is Mouth Rot? </h2><p>Mouth rot is also known as infectious stomatitis and is an infection of the mouth of a snake or other type of reptile. Bacteria such as andare often found in mouth rot infections. Other types of bacteria or even fungus such as sp. can also be cultured in or around the mouth cavity.</p><h2>Symptoms of Mouth Rot in Snakes </h2><p>Though your snake may have symptoms indicating mouth rot, take your pet to the veterinarian because there may be another underlying cause of mouth rot that needs to be uncovered.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Loss of Appetite </h3><p>Since mouth rot can cause pain and inflammation in the mouth, a snake will not want to eat or have a decrease in appetite as the infection worsens.</p><h3>Weight Loss </h3><p>If loss of appetite occurs, the snake may lose weight and the spine may become more prominent.</p><h3>Discharge or Bleeding Around the Mouth </h3><p>Blood, mucus, or pus are commonly seen around the mouth and if you open your snake's mouth, it may also be present inside. Pus in reptiles looks more like cottage cheese than a fluid and it may also be pink if it is mixed with blood.</p><h3>Foul Smell </h3><p>A foul smell is also not uncommon due to the bacteria that are present, as well as from any pus-filled lesions.</p><h3>Swollen Mouth </h3><p>The mouth of a snake will become red, inflamed, and as a result, swollen when it has this disease. The snake may also have small blister-like lesions inside or around the oral cavity making the area swollen.</p><h3>Open-Mouth Breathing </h3><p>It is not normal behavior for a snake to breathe with an open mouth. If the infection and swelling are severe enough, the snake will begin to breathe with its mouth open.</p><h2>Causes of Mouth Rot </h2><p>Mouth rot is usually not a primary disease but is typically the result of another problem. It's also not contagious on its own.</p><h2>Diagnosing Mouth Rot in Snakes </h2><p>If you suspect your snake has mouth rot, visit the veterinarian as soon as possible. The doctor will look for signs of underlying problems during the physical examination and discuss potential causes in case it is something that needs to be corrected at home.</p><p>To diagnose the type of infection your snake may have cytology and/or a culture of the mouth discharge may be collected. Cytology will confirm the presence of bacteria or fungus as well as blood, while a culture will determine what kind of bacteria or fungus is present. Since so many different types of bacteria and fungus can cause mouth rot, a culture may be necessary to have completed prior to prescribing medications for treatment.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If the cause of the mouth rot is known, you may then need to correct potential care or environmental issues. Additionally, UVB lighting and vitamin supplementation may be recommended to aid in healing, and removal of bedding that could potentially stick to the mouth sores will help keep the wounds clean.</p><h2>Prognosis for Snakes With Mouth Rot </h2><p>Snakes treated promptly for mild cases of mouth rot experience a good outcome. If the mouth rot is advanced and the result of a serious underlying cause, such as cancer, the infection may become fatal for the snake.</p><h2>How to Prevent Mouth Rot </h2><p>To prevent mouth rot from developing in your snake, you should provide a proper environment and diet at all times.</p>",669
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-snakes-like-being-pet-5195042,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes,<h1>Do Snakes Like Being Pet?</h1>,"<h1>Do Snakes Like Being Pet?</h1><p>When a dog is pet, its tail may wag, it may lean against you, or it may lick you and nudge you for more attention. Pet snakes, on the other hand, do not typically have the same desire for physical attention as a dog; but every snake is different. Knowing if your snake enjoys being pet, how to safely pet it, and when to avoid touching it can help prevent you from getting bitten and stressing out your pet.</p><h2>Do Snakes Like Being Pet? </h2><p>Snakes do not typically like being pet, but some that become accustomed to being handled don't mind the human interaction. Snakes can definitely feel when you pet them but the sensation is not as desirable as it is for many domesticated animals. If your snake isn't trying to squirm away or bite you when you pet it, it's possible that it doesn't mind the physical attention, but it is difficult to know whether it truly likes it.</p><p>Snakes may rub onto other snakes during mating rituals or to remove dead skin during a shed, so when their body is rubbed or pet it usually has a specific purpose. But snakes also enjoy squirming around in new bedding, so they can enjoy tactile sensations and will seek out surfaces and substrates that feel good. Some snake owners, particularly of ball pythons, claim their snakes even rub their faces against their arms or hands, but it is usually thought they do this after eating to clean their face or to realign their jaw if it has shifted after feeding.</p><h2>How Do You Pet a Snake? </h2><p>If your snake doesn't seem to mind being pet, gentle and occasional handling is fine. Some snakes seem to enjoy a light massage down the length of their body, a head stroke, belly rub, or even a chin scratch, while others do not. Every snake has a different personality and may enjoy something different but being gentle and respecting your snake's boundaries are important. If your snake begins to hiss, squirm away, attempt to bite, strike, or puff up, stop petting it. These are obvious signs that your snake is unhappy and does not appreciate your affection.</p><p>Regardless of where you are petting your snake, it's important to remember that snakes should always be pet in the direction going from their head to their tail. You should never pet your snake against the direction the scales naturally sit as this can be uncomfortable for them.</p><h2>When Not to Pet a Snake </h2><p>There are a variety of times when attempting to pet a snake is not advisable. You should leave your snake alone when it is shedding as its skin may be more sensitive or it may have difficulty seeing. It may also be stressed and you could prematurely remove old skin and cause accidental damage to your snake's new skin layer.</p><p>Meal time is another time that you should avoid petting your snake. If your snake is in the mood for a meal, putting your hands into its enclosure, much less attempting to pet it, is not a wise move. Your snake may mistake your hands or fingers for food and bite you instead of its food.</p><p>Finally, if your snake is sick, has parasites, or is injured, avoid handling and petting it. Allow it to rest, stay warm, and avoid the unnecessary stress or pain that petting may cause.</p><h2>How to Bond With Your Snake </h2><p>You can still bond with a snake that doesn't like to be pet. Since every snake will react differently to being handled, forming a bond with snakes may vary from pet to pet so you'll need to find out what you and your snake enjoy most. Some snakes will enjoy meal time more than others, thrive when they seek out new smells and enrichment opportunities, or even sit and enjoy a chin rub from you. You may like watching your snake eat, enjoy providing it with a clean enclosure, or love getting creative by making various enrichment toys. Create opportunities for your snake to explore and be stimulated and just spend time with your pet. A bond will form as your care for your snake, even if petting is not part of the routine.</p>",703
55,https://www.thesprucepets.com/retained-eye-caps-in-snakes-1239490,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes,<h1>Retained Eye Caps in Snakes</h1>,"<h1>Retained Eye Caps in Snakes</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Snakes don't exactly have eyelids. Instead, they have specially-adapted scales over their eyes called eye caps (or spectacles) that help with protection. During a normal shedding cycle, the eye caps usually come off. But sometimes they remain attached, resulting in a condition called retained eye caps that can impair vision and even cause infection if it persists through multiple sheds.</p><h2>What Are Retained Eye Caps? </h2><p>Retained eye caps are scales over a snake's eyes that do not fall off during shedding as they should. This problem can happen to any snake, but it is more likely to occur in malnourished or dehydrated snakes.</p><h2>Symptoms of Retained Eye Caps in Snakes </h2><p>When you examine your snake's shed skin, the eye caps should be intact, meaning there should be no holes where the eyes were. If there are eye holes, then it's possible they fell away separately from the rest of the skin or were retained on the snake.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Inspect your snake's eyes to see if they are clear or cloudy. Clear eyes usually mean the eye caps have shed, whereas a cloudy appearance in one or both eyes can indicate retained eye caps. Other conditions can cause cloudy eyes though, so consult an exotics veterinarian who is experienced with reptiles.</p><p>Behavioral signs associated with retained eye caps are uncharacteristic nervousness and aggression when you approach your snake. Impaired vision can make snakes uncertain of their surroundings, prompting anxiety. Your snake may also refuse food because it is too nervous to eat. If infection or other health conditions are present, these may also affect your snake's behavior and appetite.</p><h2>Causes of Retained Eye Caps </h2><p>A common cause of retained eye caps is a lack of humidity in the snake's enclosure. Dehydration can affect your reptile's health in many ways and can contribute to other shedding problems as well.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Your veterinarian may suggest a visit to remove retained eye caps so that they don't impair your snake's vision or set the stage for infection, especially if they have been retained through multiple sheds.</p><p>Another option your vet may recommend is soaking the snake in slightly warm water a couple of times a day. Make sure the water is just deep enough to cover your snake's body, and supervise it to prevent flailing or drowning. After a few days, the softening of the retained skin may help your snake shed its caps.</p><p>Some seasoned snake owners remove the eye caps with tape. If you feel comfortable performing this process, take a piece of clear tape and gently but firmly press it onto the snake's eye cap. Slowly peel it off, and the cap should stick to the tape. Proceed with caution, though, as this method can cause harm to your snake if the tape sticks to its scales or if you perform this process on an eye without a retained cap.</p><p>Infections or mites must be treated with medication prescribed by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Prognosis for a Snake with Retained Eye Caps </h2><p>Most snakes fare just fine, even if their eye caps are retained for a shed or two. If the caps require manual removal, carefully loosening or taping the caps will alleviate the problem and allow the snake to return to its normal routine.</p><p>The most significant predictors of snake health after removing its retained eye caps are its environment and diet. Appropriate humidity and temperature, adequate space, and a nutrient-rich diet tailored to your species of snake are all vital to its health and happiness,</p><h2>Preventing Retained Eye Caps </h2><p>To prevent incomplete shedding (or dysecdysis) in snakes, maintain proper humidity levels in your snake's enclosure. Most snakes thrive in an environment with 50 to 70 percent humidity. Misting your tropical snake regularly also helps it retain the moisture needed for proper shedding.</p><p>Make sure your enclosure is clean and free of blunt objects to prevent infection or harm to your snake's eye area.</p><p>Feed your snake a balanced diet, complete with ample water for hydration. Additionally, you can provide a ""shedding box"" for your snake by placing a damp paper towel into a well-ventilated box. The microclimate inside creates an optimal environment for shedding.</p>",689

This means that as a snake grows, you will have to adjust the size of the prey fed to the snake to accommodate the snake's increasing size. Choosing prey that's too large can result in serious health issues for your pet snake. If the prey is too large, injuries are more likely and can cause gut impaction.</p><h2>Choosing the Prey Size </h2><p>If you have a hard time judging how big around your snake is compared to the size of prey at the pet store, measure your snake at the widest part of its body. If you take a piece of string cut to that measurement to the pet store, you can do a quick check of the circumference of the prey available to find the best match. It doesn't have to be an exact measurement, however; smaller or slightly larger prey is fine, too, and a bit of variety never hurts. When in doubt, ask the pet store clerk for help.</p><h2>Feeding Hatchlings </h2><p>Very small hatchling snakes can be started on pinky mice (newborn mice) and then graduate to larger sizes. The main terms used for feeder mice are fuzzies, hoppers, and weaned mice or weanlings, then large and extra-large adult.</p><h2>Feeding Rats to Snakes </h2><p>If you have a species of snake that grows large enough that they will eventually eat rats, it is a good idea to switch to rats while the snake is still young, to get them used to eat rats rather than mice. While mice are very timid creatures with few defensive capabilities, rats are very inquisitive, and a larger rat can do serious damage to your snake. If you plan on feeding live prey, you will want to get your snake used to eating prey that can fight back while they're still young. Additionally, never place live prey into your snakes enclosure and leave; always monitor your snake so its prey doesn't injure it. Younger rats are equivalent in size to older mice, so when your snake has graduated to larger mice, it's a good time to make the rodent switch. Feeder rats are named with a similar progression as mice: pinkies, fuzzies, pups, weanlings, then small through extra large adults.</p><h2>How to Prevent Snake Regurgitation </h2><p>Snakes have unique jaws that allow them to swallow prey that is larger than their head, but your snake may have difficulties digesting overly large items, resulting in regurgitation. Another common cause of regurgitation is handling your snake too soon after it's eaten. While every snake is different, you should wait at least 24 to 48 hours after feeding to handle your pet. If he regurgitates when you handle him after 48 hours, then try giving him another day of rest.</p><p>Snakes will also regurgitate due to stress. If your snake is stressed by loud noises or people tapping on the glass of their tank, try putting them in a quiet area after feeding and giving them space. Your snake will be ready to play in a couple of days. Regurgitation takes a lot out of snakes, so wait about two weeks before trying to feed them again. When you do feed them, make the meal smaller.</p><p>It's important to understand the difference between regurgitation and vomiting in your snake. Regurgitation happens before the food reaches the stomach. When a snake expels digested food that's been in its stomach, it's called vomiting and is usually a sign of illness. Vomiting is a bigger issue than regurgitation because the snake loses a lot of amino acids and electrolytes that it needs to remain healthy and maintain an ideal body weight. If your snake is vomiting or repeatedly regurgitating its food, get it to a vet immediately. Vomiting and regurgitation can both be fatal in snakes.</p>",694
57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-why-snakes-hiss-5215794,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes,<h1>4 Reasons Why Snakes Hiss</h1>,"<h1>4 Reasons Why Snakes Hiss</h1><p>The sound of a snake hissing is unmistakable and usually makes you freeze in your tracks. If your pet snake is hissing, you might wonder why. Humans don't ""speak snake,"" but understanding the reasons why your snake hisses can help make it feel safeand comfortableand protect you from a potential snake bite.</p><p>All creatures in the animal kingdom communicate, either through sound, body language or both. Similar to a dog's growl, a snake's hiss generally means ""back off!"" Snakes usually hiss when they feel threatened, angry, or annoyed.</p><h2>How Do Snakes Hiss? </h2><p>Snakes are able to hiss thanks to a structure in thethroat called the glottis. The glottis is a hole at the bottom of the snake's mouth that connects to its windpipe. The glottis allows a snake to continue to breathe when it's swallowing a large prey meal. Inside the glottis is a small piece of cartilage. If a snake exhales forcibly, that small piece of cartilage in the glottis vibrates, making the hissing sound we are all familiar with.</p><h2>Why Do Snakes Hiss? </h2><p>All species of snakes can hiss, but some snakes naturally hiss more than others. Snakes living in the wild tend to hiss more readily than snakes in captivity. This is because wild snakes typically find themselves in danger more frequently than pet snakes, so they are used to reacting to uncertain or dangerous situations with a hiss.</p><p>Fun fact:Snakes don't hiss at other snakes to ""talk"" to each other. Hissing is only intended to be heard by potential non-snake predators. In fact, snakes can't even hear other snakes hissing. This is due to the frequency of the hissing sound, which is too high for snakes to hear.</p><p>Here are some reasons your snake hisses.</p><h2>Your Snake Is Afraid </h2><p>A pet snake might hiss of you catch it off guard, for instance, picking it up when it did not realize you were about to do that. To avoid startling your pet snake, always approach it unhurriedly, and use slow, obvious hand movements that indicate to the snake that you are about to touch it. Baby snakes may hiss more than adult snakes because they are still getting used to being handled by humans.</p><h2>Your Snake Is Annoyed </h2><p>Snakes are not always happy about being handled, and a snake will let you knowwith a hissthat it is not in the mood to be held. If you have been handling your snake too much recently, it might hiss to tell you it needs a break from being touched and held. In this case, simply leave your snake alone for a while before attempting to touch it again.</p><h2>Your Snake Is Digesting its Meal </h2><p>There are some specific times that experts recommend you should not handle your snake. For instance, if your snake has just consumed a large meal, it will want to be left alone while it digests the food. Avoid picking up your snake after it has eaten until you know it has finished digestion. This may be days or weeks depending on the species of snake and how large a meal it consumed.</p><h2>Your Snake Is About to Start Shedding </h2><p>Another time experts recommend leaving your snake alone is when the snake is about to start shedding. Snakes shed their skins several times a year (usually three or four times annually). During its shedding time, a snake may feel upset or nervous, especially since its vision may be obstructed from the shedding process. If you know your snake is about to shed its skin, or if your snake is in the process of shedding its skin, give it some time off from handling to avoid upsetting your snake.</p><h2>What to Do if Your Snake Is Hissing </h2><p>As previously mentioned, hissing is a form of communication. If your snake is missing at you, it means it's feeling afraid, upset or annoyed. Any time your snake hisses at you, stop handling it and give it some time alone. If possible, try to identify the reason your snake is hissing so you can remove the trigger and help your snake feel comfortable and happy.</p>",679
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-care-for-a-reticulated-python-5199957,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>How to Care for a Reticulated Python</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Reticulated Python</h1><p>Reticulated pythons are some of the largest pet snakes there are. They are not snakes for beginner reptile enthusiasts, nor are they ideal for children, but some experienced herpetology lovers opt to care for them as pets. Native to Southeast Asia, reticulated pythons grow to be very long and heavy and can also live for two or three decades. Knowing what kind of care they need as pets is necessary to help them achieve this long life span as well as ensure you and your family stay safe.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s):Reticulated python</p><p>Scientific Name: (but also known as )</p><p>Adult Size:Over 16 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: Over 20 years</p><h2>Reticulated Python Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Reticulated pythons are not cuddly pets; they have the ability to coil around a person and suffocate them, but if care is taken, they can be handled by multiple individuals when necessary. Weighing in at over 200 lbs., these snakes are usually slow moving, spending most of their day at rest or waiting for their prey. Reticulated pythons are typically found on the ground, but they may also enjoy swimming in nearby bodies of water. They are typically regarded as being an aggressive species of snake because it is difficult to regularly handle them.</p><h2>Housing the Reticulated Python </h2><p>Because adult reticulated pythons are extremely large, a typical snake terrarium will simply not do. Reticulated pythons require a large, custom enclosure that measures about two feet wide by three feet tall by eight feet long, a small bedroom, or a walk-in closet. A hide box or log of some sort should be available in the enclosure at all times. Security is of the utmost concern; these large snakes are very strong and can escape from an enclosure that is not made of strong materials. Latches or locks should also be present on all lids and doors to ensure your reticulated python cannot push its way out of its enclosure.</p><p>Spot-cleaning after your snake sheds or eliminates are necessary but to maintain the cleanliness of your enclosure, monthly full cleanings should be performed. This full break down of the enclosure will help prevent build-up of debris and bacteria. Some people opt to clean half of the enclosure at a time while the other half contains their reticulated python. It's a good idea to have someone watching your snake if you are inside the enclosure. You won't be paying attention to what your snake is doing, and having someone else keep an eye on the space while you are near the snake will help prevent any accidental injuries or your snake escaping.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>Reticulated pythons are from rainforest environments but they don't require extreme heat. You should provide a basking area of 90-92 degrees during the day with the thermal gradient dropping to about 75 degrees on the cool part of the enclosure. A heat light or ceramic heat bulb are ideal for providing these air temperatures but make sure your snake cannot touch the bulb or fixture or thermal burns will result. Use thermometers placed around the enclosure to ensure there are no spots that are too hot or too cold.</p><h2>Light</h2><p>If you are using a white heat light to provide heat, then you are also providing light for your reticulated python, but if you are using another type of bulb then you'll still want to provide a source of white light. A 12-hour day and night cycle is necessary to decrease stress and mimic a natural environment. As with the heat light, make sure your snake cannot get to the white light or it can become injured.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>Reticulated pythons typically need their enclosures to have humidity levels between 50-70%. During shedding, your hygrometer in your enclosure should read closer to 70% unless you have a humidity hide box. If you keep the humidity too high, mold and bacteria will grow more quickly which puts your snake at a higher risk of developing skin infections and mouth rot.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Substrate or bedding for your reticulated python should consist of a bioactive soil, newspaper, aspen wood shavings, cypress mulch, or cardboard. More natural environments will be more difficult to clean. Depending on your level of commitment, money invested, and time available to clean out the enclosure every month, you may want to choose an affordable and easy to replace option like newspaper for the bottom of the enclosure.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Chickens, rabbits and rats are the common prey items fed to full-grown reticulated pythons in captivity. The size of your snake's prey should be comparable to the widest portion of your snake and offered every one to two weeks. Overfeeding will cause health issues but you shouldn't underfeed it either. Make sure your snake's spine is not visibly sticking up under the skin. You should be able to feel the spine if you press lightly on your snake's body, but the body should be round in appearance.</p><p>Finally, a large container of water that fits your snake's entire body or even allows it to swim should be provided at all times. This will aid in the humidity in the enclosure but also provide your snake with a spot to soak, swim, and defecate.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like other snakes, mouth rot, parasites, wounds from live prey, respiratory issues from cold enclosures, bacterial and fungal infections, retained shed, and impaction are common health concerns for reticulated pythons. Maintaining an appropriately warm and humid environment for your snake can help avoid these and other health problems.</p><h2>Choosing Your Reticulated Python </h2><p>When purchasing any reptile, make sure it is a captive bred (cb) pet and not wild caught. Look for signs of illness around the vent, eyes, and mouth as well as pieces of retained skin from an old shed. If the snake has any nasal or oral discharge or abnormalities to the face, eyes, or skin, it may not be a healthy snake.</p><p>Once you have found a healthy snake to purchase, ask the breeder or pet store what type of food it is currently eating and the time of its last feeding. If they do not know, find a new seller that can provide this important information for you. Expect to pay anywhere from $175 to $14,500, if not more for a reticulated python, depending on the size and morph of the snake. These snakes usually cost more the larger they are and the more exotic their colors and patterns are.</p>",1079
59,https://www.thesprucepets.com/green-tree-python-profile-5120207,Reptiles & Amphibians > Pet Snakes > Pet Snake Species,<h1>Green Tree Python Species Overview</h1>,"<h1>Green Tree Python Species Overview</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>The green tree python is a bright green nonvenomous snake with diamond-shaped heads and irregular scales. They may also have white oryellowvertebral stripes, while some of these snakes have yellow, green,or blue spots. Found in the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, eastern Indonesia, and the Cape York Peninsula of Australia, their coloration helps them to remain camouflaged within their environment: the bright green color helps them remain hidden among the leaves of tall trees in the rainforest.</p><p>Named for their vibrant green color (although they are generally born red or yellow then change color as they become adults), the green tree python is also known for its prehensile tail, which helps these snakes climb as well as assists with catching prey. In the wild, you might find a green tree python coiled up and hanging horizontally on branches. They will dangle their tails to lure prey, and then continue to hold on to the branch while they attack and devour their next meal. Better yet, they have heat-sensing pits on their mouth to allow them to sense when a warm-blooded creature is approaching.</p><p>As pets, these are shy snakes that aren't particularly high-maintenance (with the exception of the required humidity levels within their enclosure). Though vibrant and exotic, they will not tolerate being handled often, can be prone to biting when startled, and may not make as good a pet as some other snakes.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Green Tree Python</p><p>Scientific Name: Morelia viridis</p><p>Adult Size: 4-6 feet long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15-20+ years</p><h2>Green Tree Python Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>In the wild, the green tree python lives in tropical rainforests with lush vegetation and high humidity (as well as other forests and gardens) where they spend most of their time hiding in the trees. As a pet, these snakes are relatively easy to care for, but they are not a species that's going to want to be held and handled often. These are exotic display animals that are best for intermediate to advanced snake owners.</p><h2>Housing the Green Tree Python </h2><p>When having a reptile as a pet, it's important to provide a hiding place. Snakes like the green tree python prefer to have a place to take cover, although you won't want them to have a place where they could hide potentially permanently. The green tree python is not considered to be a particularly social species of snake, and therefore if given the opportunity they are likely to hide constantly and remain in one placethis could interfere with their ability to thermoregulate properly and potentially lead to illness.</p><p>In fact, their shy nature also means they often feel threatened and can be prone to biting. They can be socialized over time so they become more docile and receptive to handling on a regular basis.</p><h2>Heat </h2><p>The temperature in your green tree python's enclosure should be kept between about 86-88 degrees Fahrenheit. It's important to provide a range of temperatures for your pet snake; the cooler side of the cage should hover around 78 to 80 degrees, while at night the temperatures can drop to between 70 to 75 degrees. You'll want to avoid going below 70 degrees at any time.</p><h2>Light </h2><p>Unlike many other pets, the good news about most snakes, including the green tree python, is that they don't require special lighting. While they don't require full-spectrum lighting, it will enable you to be able to truly see the brilliant colors of the green tree python.</p><h2>Humidity </h2><p>The green tree python is a species that requires humidity. Once you have the appropriate-sized enclosure (which should also have the ability to retain humidity and provide adequate airflow), you have to be sure to keep both the temperatures and the humidity level within the correct range. The green tree python's enclosure should be kept humid (but not wet) in order to prevent both skin and respiratory issues.</p><p>You'll want to provide a basking spot with an over-the-cage heat lamp, ceramic heat emitter, or radiant heat panel.These should be controlled with a thermostat, and you should also consider investing in a hydrometer, a device that measures humidity, to ensure that the humidity levels in your green tree python's enclosure range between 40 to 70 percent.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most substrates will be suitable for green tree pythons. But while newspaper is the cheapest and probably easiest to obtain, many snake owners opt for a more natural substrate, such as coconut husk. It can hold moisture for several days and help ensure proper cleanliness and hygiene in your snake's enclosure.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Green tree pythons prefer to eat mostly small mammals and other reptiles; in the wild they are known to eat frogs, birds, lizards, bats, and other vertebrates, especially those found in trees. They will sometimes leave the trees and feed on ground-dwelling rodents, which is why when kept as pets they are often fed a diet that primarily consists of rats and mice.</p><p>As juveniles, these snakes are considered to be diurnal, which means they'll be more active and hunt their prey during the day. But as they become adults, the green tree python will become nocturnal and their hunting and other activity will primarily occur in the overnight hours.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>As long as you properly care for your green tree python, you can expect it to live into its mid-teen years or even early 20s, especially while in human care. Though they are considered a bit more fragile than other popular pet snake species, such as boas, ball pythons, kingsnakes, or corn snakes, if their care requirements are met they generally live a long, healthy life.</p><h2>Choosing your Green Tree Python </h2><p>When purchasing a green tree python, be sure you're working with a breeder in order to avoid ending up with a snake with health issues such as parasites or other conditions.Keep in mind that these are definitely not a species that's meant for inexperienced keepers.</p>",982

They typically grow to be up to five feet long, they are not as large as many of the other constricting snakes that are kept as pets,they are quite docile, and they are easy to handle.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Ball python</p><p>Adult Size: 4-5 feet</p><p>Life Expectancy: Typically 20 to 30 years, but 50 or more is possible</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Docile Ball Python</h3><h2>Behavior and Temperament of Ball Pythons </h2><p>Ball pythons are so named because, when threatened, they roll themselves into a tight ball, tucking their head inside their coils. Young ball pythons grow about a foot a year for three years. They can live for 20-30 years with proper care, and it's possible for them to live for decades longer.</p><p>Wild-caught snakes tend to be very stressed from capture and transport and can harbor a large parasite load. Captive-bred snakes tend to be more expensive, but they are readily available.</p><h2>Housing Ball Pythons </h2><p>Ball pythons are not terribly active snakes,so a smaller enclosure is fine (use a 20-gallon tank for younger snakes and a 30-gallon tank for an adult). They are, however, adept escape artists, so a securely fitted top is absolutely necessary.</p><p>You have many options for a substrate for your snake including shredded bark, newsprint, and Astroturf. Astroturf is probably the easiest because you can cut a few pieces to fit the cage and simply replace the dirty pieces as necessary. The soiled pieces can be soaked in a solution of one gallon of water with 2 tablespoons of bleach, rinsed well, dried, and then used again.</p><p>Provide sturdy branches and a dark hiding place for your snake. They like to feel securely enclosed, so it should be just large enough to accommodate the snake.</p><p>The temperature in your ball python's cage should range from 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit on the cool side with a basking spot maintained at 88-92 degrees F. Nighttime temperatures can fall to around 75 degrees F.</p><p>An under-the-tank heating pad designed for reptiles works well but can make it difficult to monitor the temperature. An incandescent heat bulb or ceramic heating element can be used to achieve the basking temperatures.</p><p>Never use hot rocks with pet reptiles, and make sure the bulb or heat element is screened off to prevent contact with the snake otherwise burns may result. Use multiple thermometers to monitor the temperatures in the cage: one at the bottom of the cage and one at the basking spot.</p><p>Provide a dish large enough for your snake to soak in. Soaking is particularly helpful during sheds. Some owners like to provide a covered dish (e.g. plastic storage container) with a hole in the lid to provide security for the snake, so it will soak longer if necessary.</p><p>Another alternative is to provide a humidity retreat, which similarly uses a covered container with an access hole lined with damp sphagnum moss or paper towels to provide moisture (a water dish is still provided outside the retreat).</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Ball pythons can be fed exclusively mice or small to medium-sized rats (as appropriate for the size of the snake) and only need to be fed every week or two. Young snakes should be fed fuzzy mice every 5 to 7 days, while older snakes should be fed increasinglylarger preyand can go a little longer, up to two weeks. Usepre-killed prey sincelive micecan injure a snake. Dangling the prey in front of the snake with forceps usually gets the snake interested in it.</p><p>Moving the snake out of its cage into a separate enclosure for feeding is a good idea and will help in the taming process. The snake will associate eating with the other enclosure and is less likely to confuse your hand for prey when you put your hand into the cage. This will make it easier to reach into the cage to get the ball python out for handling.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>If you already have a constricting snake at home, any new python (or boa) should be quarantined due to the risk of inclusion body disease. Experts vary on the length of recommended quarantine time, but 3 to 6 months is not extreme. In addition, a vet check is in order, especially for internal (take a recent stool sample) andexternal parasites.</p><p>Even captive-bred ball pythons sometimes refuse to eat, fasting for a couple of months. As long as body weight and condition are maintained, this is not problematic.</p><p>If your snake stops eating, carefully examine the husbandry, handling, health, and environment of the snake to make sure stress isn't the culprit. Consult a knowledgeable vet or experienced keeper for help if the fast is prolonged or causes weight loss over 10%.</p><p>If necessary, some tricks to entice a python to eat include dipping the prey in chicken broth, trying different colors of mice, exposing the brain of the prey before feeding it, feeding at night, and covering the cage with towels after offering a mouse.</p><p>You may even want to tryfeeding a hamster, although this may make your snake more likely to refuse mice if it develops a preference.</p><h2>Choosing a Ball Python </h2><p>When you are ready to get your ball python, look for a young, captive-bred snake (you may have to find a breeder for this). Choose a snake that has a well-rounded body, clean eyes and vent, and that shows no signs of respiratory problems (wheezing, bubbles around nostrils).</p><p>Look for one that is alert and curious and gently grips your hand/arms when handled. It may be skittish but should calm after handling for a bit. It is not a bad idea to ask for a feeding demonstration to be sure the snake readily takes a meal.</p>",959

Red-tails grow to be around 10 feet long but can be larger with lengths of 15 feet recorded. They don't make good pets for those unwilling to make the commitment to care for a snake that eats large rats or rabbits and can live about 30 years or longer in captivity.</p><p>They are known for the distinct red tip on the end of their tails.</p><h3>Kenyan Sand Boa</h3><p>Growing to be about a foot and a half long, these are unique burrowing snakes. They are usually docile snakes that burrow their entire body under sand while keeping just their tiny head exposed to strike at passing prey. They are beautifully colored with yellow and brown patterns.</p><h2>Pythonidae </h2><h3>Ball Python</h3><p>Arguably the most popular pet snake there is, the ball python is a very even-tempered, docile snake. They only grow to be about 3-5 feet in length but can live as long as 35 years in captivity. They get their name from the tight ball they curl up into when they feel threatened. These snakes don't require much in the way of heating or lighting and make great first snake pets but do have specific requirements to stay healthy. Find out more here.</p><h3>Burmese Python</h3><p>These are large snakes but still regularly seen as pets. Growing to be 15-20 feet long (and sometimes even longer), Burmese are usually pretty docile but a little more active than your smaller ball python. Feeding these big guys isn't for someone scared of handling dead rats, or other larger prey items. Due to their heavy weight when full grown and their extreme length, Burmese pythons may be better left for adult snake owners.</p><h3>Green Tree Python </h3><p>Arboreal snakes add a little more interest to a typical snake enclosure. Green tree pythons like to curl up in an elegant clump and hang onto a little tree limb. Very vibrant green (sometimes with yellow or blue dots) as adults, they reach lengths of about 5 feet and are often confused with the emerald tree boa.</p><h3>Blood Python </h3><p>Known to be a little temperamental, the blood python is a stocky snake with lovely patterns. They have short tails and can grow to be between 6 and 8 feet long. They get their name from the brick-red blotches commonly found in their patterns.</p><h2>Colubridae </h2><h3>King Snake</h3><p>Closely related to the milk snake, king snakes grow to be about 5-7 feet in length making them a smaller pet snake. They got their name from the fact that they will readily eat other snakes so they should definitely be housed alone. King snakes are native to North America and breed regularly in captivity so finding a captive-bred pet shouldn't be difficult.</p><h3>Milk Snake</h3><p>Actually, a species king snake, the milk snake ismost commonly seen in the pet trade closely mimics the color patterns of the venomous coral snake (known as Batesian mimicry). The common saying, ""Red on yellow will kill a fellow, but red on black is a friend of Jack"" refers to the band patterns found on coral and milk snakes. Coral snakes have red bands next to yellow bands while milk snakes have red bands next to black bands.</p><h3>Black Rat Snake </h3><p>Perhaps one of the plainer looking snakes, the rat snake makes up for his lack of luster in his athletic abilities. Able to swim and climb trees, this is an active snake. They will wrinkle their bodies up to resemble a rattlesnake and even vibrate the ends of their tails when startled or frightened. The rat snake constricts his prey before eating it and is native to the central and eastern United States.</p><h3>Corn Snake</h3><p>A species of rat snake, the corn snake is a popular beginners snake due it's small size but also a well-loved snake to the experienced keeper because of their varying color patterns. Corn snakes usually max out at about 5 feet and are excellent escape artists, as are many snakes. They aren't known to be biters and are pretty docile snakes.</p><p>Depending on breed, your pet snake can cost anywhere from $15 to $1000.</p><p>Local pet shops are a great place to find a snake; you can also look online for reputable breeders.</p><p>Gently pick up the snake in the middle, and don't hold on too tight. Remember to support it with both hands.</p><p>You don't. Snakes do not love being pet, but with some time and familiarity yours won't mind being handled by you.</p>",839

But tortoises can live a very long time (anywhere from 50 to 100 years). If you take one as a pet, be prepared to provide a lifetime of care and consider that your pet might even outlive you.</p><h2>Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Most tortoises are docile and tend to be shy unless two males are put into an enclosure with each other. This is not advisable; two male tortoises could become aggressive toward each other and even attack each other, sometimes resulting in serious injury.</p><p>Most tortoises are too large to handle as adults, and it's advisable not to handle them to any great degree when they are smaller, either. This can cause the tortoise stress, which often leads to illness if the stressful situation is ongoing.</p><p>The biggest drawback to a pet tortoise for most people is its long lifespan. Larger tortoises, like the sulcata, can live for up to 80 years, so you'll need to have a plan for caring for a pet tortoise in their (and your) old age.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Many tortoisespecies are fairly large and need a decent-sized enclosure, preferably outdoors. Because of these preferable housing arrangements, pet tortoises are best suited for areas with milder climates.</p><p>Depending on the temperatures where the tortoise originates and the area where you live, it may be necessary to bring pet tortoises indoors overnight or during cooler weather, and with the larger tortoises, providing indoor housing can be a big challenge. Some species also need to hibernate, which can be very stressful on the tortoise and requires special environmental conditions.</p><p>When constructing an outdoor pen, you must make sure it is strong and that you bury your fences if you have a burrowing pet tortoise. Tortoises are quite strong, especially the larger ones, and flimsy enclosures won't hold them for very long.</p><p>Some tortoises also climb surprisingly well, so they may require a roofed pen. It is also very important to make sure the enclosure keeps predators out (including dogs). Make sure there are no dangers in the pen, including poisonous plants. Provide only shallow water, no sharp objects, and no small, inedible objects that may be accidentally ingested.</p><p>Also for some tortoises, trying to climb steps or other obstacles can result in them tipping onto their backs, which is something that should be avoided. Most pet tortoises will also need some shelter outdoors, such as a dog house (many owners often heat these).</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Tortoises can makeinteresting pets, although they can present some challenges due to their size and dietary habits. Diets vary based on species, but all pet tortoises need quite a variety of foods with careful attention paidto the amount of roughage as well as thecalcium/phosphorusbalances of their food.</p><p>Some species have voracious appetites and also need a large amount of food. Time for daily food preparation and the costs associated with the amount of food a tortoise eats should be taken into consideration before getting one as a pet.</p><h3>Watch Now: Top Names and Facts About Pet Turtles</h3><h2>Choosing Your Pet </h2><p>It isbest, as with any reptile, to get a captive-bred pet tortoiseif at all possible. This isn't easy to do for some species, but the capture and shipping conditions can be appalling and result in stressed animals that are then more prone to disease. It is also possible in some areas to locate pet tortoises from rescues; many of these are from owners who decided they couldn't handle the amount of upkeep and care a tortoise requires.</p><p>Any pet tortoise that is new to your household should be checked for parasites and quarantined for a while to ensure that it is healthy, especially if other tortoises are present. Some species can be aggressive with other tortoises, and if a couple of males are kept in too small of an enclosure, fighting may result. This could lead to potentially serious injuries around the eyes and on the legs.</p><p>It is vital to choose the right species of pet tortoisefor youbased on housing needs, environmental needs, and diet requirements. Different species have markedly different adult sizes, temperature and light needs, diets, and some need to hibernate while others do not.</p><p>Be sure to research each individual species of tortoise you are considering, prior to acquiringyour new pet. Common pet tortoises include Russian, red-footed (and cherry head varieties), sulcata, Greek, and radiated tortoises, but there are also many others.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like most reptiles, tortoises are prone to respiratory infections. Pet tortoises that were raised in the wild are more likely to suffer from respiratory infections, which result from unsanitary conditions. Much like aquatic turtles, a tortoise with a respiratory infection will appear lethargic, lose weight, and may show excess mucus around its mouth and nasal passages. Early signs of a respiratory infection include wheezing and a tortoise refusing food.</p><p>Respiratory infections are usually treated with antibiotics that are given via injection, but this requires a diagnosis from a qualified reptile veterinarian. While your tortoise is undergoing treatment for a respiratory infection, it should be kept warm.</p><p>Tortoises also are susceptible to metabolic bone disease (MBD), which is the result of a diet that doesn't have enough calcium. Like many reptiles, tortoises need to be exposed to ultraviolet radiation A and B (UVA/B) to be able to absorb calcium. Tortoises in the wild typically bask in the sun for most of their waking hours to get this level of UVA/B exposure.</p><p>If a tortoise doesn't get enough calcium, its shell will show the signs first. If it's a young tortoise, the shell may not grow at a rapid enough rate. Older tortoises may develop weak bones in their legs, have difficulty walking, or even suffer bone fractures.</p><p>MBD is treatable, but the longer it persists, the less chance of recovery the tortoise has. Consult a qualified veterinarian, who will likely advise a calcium-heavy diet and more exposure to sunlight or UVA/B rays.</p><h2>Suitable Species </h2><p>As you consider bringing a pet tortoise into your home, you may find it useful to read further about certain species mentioned here, such as the sulcata, Greek tortoise, and the red-footed tortoise. Hermann's tortoise is another good species to keep as pets, or you may find that another breed of tortoise would be the right pet for you.</p><p>Greek tortoises are super easy to care for and grow to be 5 to 8 inches long. Egyptian tortoises are fun because they are small enough for apartment dwellers. Pancake tortoises are flat-shaped and move quickly, perfect for playing with. Leopard tortoises have gorgeous shells, and grow to be 10 to 18 inches long.</p><p>It's best to approach your tortoise so it can see you, head-on. Make sure it's on a flat surface, with no way of falling off (its cage or the floor is best). Pet its head, avoiding its eyes. If it lets you do this, try rubbing its cheeks and under its chin.</p><p>Tortoises can also feel through their shells, so pet yours on its back with your fingers, running them back and forth along their shell or making circular motions.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of your pet tortoise's food should be fresh veggies: sweet peppers, kale, collard greens, cauliflower, or dandelions, Every few feedings, about 5 to 10 percent of its diet, you can offer fresh fruitmelon, berries, or oranges. The rest of its diet should be alfalfa hay and commercial tortoise food.</p>",1250
63,https://www.thesprucepets.com/turtle-and-tortoise-shells-1239381,Reptiles & Amphibians > Tortoises,<h1>Turtle and Tortoise Shells</h1>,"<h1>Turtle and Tortoise Shells</h1><h2>Can Help You Determine If Your Pet Is Healthy</h2><p>Turtles and tortoisesof different species have shells that vary in size, color, and shape but they all have one thing in common - their shells are hard and protective. Sometimes environmental conditions, nutrition, diseases, or trauma can alter the appearance and effectiveness of these shells and knowing more about them can help you determine whether or not your turtle or tortoise is healthy.</p><h2>Normal Shells </h2><p>Turtles and tortoises have a carapace (the top or dorsal shell) and a plastron (the bottom or ventral shell), both of which should always be hard (unless it is a hatchling turtle or a species of water turtle that always has a soft shell). Both parts of the shell are connected on the side of the body to protect the turtle's organs and the majority of its body. The turtle shell is made up of visible sections referred to as scutes.</p><h3>What is a scute on a tortoise?</h3><p>Scutes on a tortoise are the hard scales making up its shell that look like separate plates. Scutes form a protective exterior layer covering the tortoise's shell bones and epithelium.</p><p>Scutes are made of keratin, similar to fingernails. The scutes cover a layer of epithelium which overlies the bony shell. As the turtle or tortoise grows, the epithelium secretes newer and bigger scutes under the outer scutes. The outer layer of scutes is the oldest. These scutes in some species of water turtles will normally shed off as individual sections as the turtle grows and sheds theirskin but the bone underneath the scutes should never be exposed. Land turtles and tortoises do not shed their scutes, but the outer layers are often worn down in species that dig burrows. The turtle's spine and ribs are attached to the carapace shell bones.</p><h2>Pyramiding </h2><p>Since turtle shells canvary in appearance from species to species, some tortoises and turtles naturally have peaks to their shells (such as the Indian Star Tortoise) but most species do not.</p><p>Pyramiding refers to the abnormal shape that the individual sections (scutes) form in the shape of a pyramid or raised peak. It is usually a husbandry issue and occurs with chronic malnutrition or inappropriate lighting. Wild turtles and tortoises do not get this problem unless some sort of trauma causes the shell to appear to be pyramiding.</p><p>Too much of a specific dietary requirement, such as protein, a lack of calcium or Vitamin D in the diet, or no Ultraviolet (UVB) lighting that enables vitamin D production, can all produce pyramids on your turtle's or tortoise's shell. These malformations are completely avoidable by providing appropriate foods, supplements, lighting, and environments for your turtles. These pyramids will remain for the life of your turtle, even after correcting the problems with the appropriate nutrition and husbandry.</p><h2>Shell Rot </h2><p>""Rot"" is a term that reptile enthusiasts use to refer to an infection somewhere on the body. Shell rot obviously refers to an infection of the shell. Both the carapace and plastron can get shell rot.</p><p>Shell rot is usually caused by bacteria growing in dirty environments, such as with dirty water (therefore it is important to knowhow to keep the water in your aquatic turtle tank clean) or moldy bedding. It occurs when bacteria infect the blood vessels and shell of a turtle and will eventually cause small pits and divots or give it a moth-eaten appearance. Soft spots may start to form or even have areas of bloody discharge. Very bad shell rot will cause entire scutes to fall off, exposing the bone (and nerves) underneath.</p><p>Shell rot needs aggressive antibiotics to treat and will take a long time to heal. Contact your exotics veterinarian if you think your turtle has an infection before it causes pain to your turtle.</p><h2>SCUD </h2><p>Septicemic cutaneous ulcerative disease (SCUD)is a serious disease that can start as an infection on the shell from some sort of trauma or wound combined with poor husbandry. It will eventually affect the liver and other organs due to the bacteria that enter the bloodstream from the wound on the shell. You should get your turtle or tortoise checked out by an exotics vet if he ever has any wound or trauma.</p><h2>Shedding </h2><p>In many species of water turtles, individual scutes should naturally shed off once or twice a year and expose only new scutes underneath. If scutes are falling off and exposing the cream/white bone then there is most likely a serious infection or some sort of trauma that has occurred to the shell. Exposed bone is painful to your turtle and is very serious.</p><h2>Metabolic Bone Disease </h2><p>MBD (metabolic bone disease) is a result of your turtle receiving inadequate calcium, Vitamin D, and UVB rays. It causes their bones to lose their calcium and their shells eventually soften or become malformed. It can be easily avoided with proper husbandry and nutrition and often times corrected with therapies.</p><h2>Keep an Eye on It </h2><p>All in all, water turtle shells should typically be free of algae, fairly smooth and even, and hard. There are always exceptions to the rules, but if your turtle's or tortoise's shell ever looks strange to you be sure to get him checked out by the vet. Reptiles heal and grow very slowly so it may take years, or may never improve depending on the disease, for the effects of shell damage to disappear if left untreated.</p><p>Lesson: Learn About The Western Chicken Turtle.</p><p>Pyramiding.</p><p>Superficial Shell Rot On Turtle.</p><p>Bacterial Diseases Of Reptiles.</p><p>Metabolic Bone Disease In Reptiles.</p>",910
64,https://www.thesprucepets.com/respiratory-infections-in-turtles-and-tortoises-1239416,Reptiles & Amphibians > Tortoises,<h1>Respiratory Infections in Turtles and Tortoises</h1>,"<h1>Respiratory Infections in Turtles and Tortoises</h1><p>Similarly to a person catching a cold or getting pneumonia, turtles and tortoises are prone to developing respiratory infections. While our pet turtles don't have play dates with other turtles that are sick, they are often subjected to an environment that may cause them to get sick.</p><h2>How Does a Turtle or Tortoise Catch a Cold? </h2><p>One of the most common reasons a turtle or tortoise gets a respiratory infection is due to its environment being too cold.</p><p>Transporting your turtle when it's cold outside can also cause it to get a chill and fall ill as well as shared air space with a sick turtle or tortoise. Your turtle may contract the same infection as the sick turtle if it is contagious so any sick turtle should always be kept in quarantine to avoid spreading germs.</p><h2>Signs to Lookout For </h2><p>The most obvious signs of respiratory infection in a turtle or tortoise are difficulty breathing (outstretched head and gulping air), a decrease in energy, a lack of appetite, swimming lopsided, unable to dive, open mouth breathing, whistling while breathing, and drainage or bubbles coming from the mouth, eyes, or nostrils.</p><h2>How Serious Is It? </h2><p>A cold or respiratory infection can turn into pneumonia and be life-threatening to your turtle. If your turtle goes for more than a few days (species and age-dependent) without being interested in food and/or is showing any signs of having a respiratory infection, it should not be ignored.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>First and foremost, check the temperatures in your turtle's enclosure both during the day and at night. If it is a large enclosure, also be sure to check multiple areas of it for cold spots. More often than not, you will find that the basking area isn't warm enough for your turtle or it is getting too cold in the enclosure at night.</p><p>Second, correct the problems if you find them. If any light bulbs have blown or the air temperature just isn't what it should be inside your turtle's enclosure, make sure you warm your turtle up. Sometimes, just increasing the temperature in the enclosure will make your turtle feel better until it can be seen by a vet. Increasing the humidity is also helpful in loosening up any debris in your turtle's respiratory tract, just like a humidifier or vaporizer helps you when you have a cold. Be sure to avoid using any human medications for your turtle or tortoise unless you are directed to do so by your veterinarian.</p><p>Finally, schedule an appointment with your exotics vet since you will most likely need turtle-safe medications to battle an infection. Cytology of any discharge that is seen may be performed to look for an infection, X-rays may be recommended to see if there are any visible changes to the heart or lungs to explain any breathing difficulties, a culture of the discharge may be recommended, and other diagnostic tests may also be discussed. Depending on the severity of the infection, your vet may want to run these and other tests or they may feel comfortable trying antibiotics first.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>You should always monitor the temperatures of your turtle's enclosureespecially with reputable products like a temperature gun. Be sure to check a variety of spots that your turtle or tortoise can get to in the enclosure at different times during the day since they may vary. You may find that at night it gets too cold when the basking light turns off or there is a cool spot in the back of the enclosure because of a draftfix this with a mercury vapor bulb that emits no light. Correct any issues you find in the enclosure and be sure to keep your turtle warm to decrease the likelihood of it catching a cold.</p>",657
