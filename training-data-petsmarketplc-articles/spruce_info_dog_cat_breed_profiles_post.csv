Despite their regal appearance, they are playful and goofy pals that sometimes act more like dogs than cats. They may look like they were pets of the pharoahs, but, in fact, they originally hail from Canada in the 1960s.</p><p>Sphynxes stand out among other cats due to their lack of fur or hair an uncommon occurrence among most mammals. These non-furry felines love to sprawl out in sunspots for warmth whenever possible. They make excellent cuddle buddies and prefer to keep warm under the covers with their owners at night. These outgoing, exceptionally friendly and playful felines generally enjoy the company of other cats, dogs, and children, making them a great choice for a family pet.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Playful, affectionate, friendly, energetic, and loving</p><p>Weight: Less than 12 pounds</p><p>Length: 13 to 15 inches, head to tail</p><p>Coat Length: Nearly hairless, peach fuzz</p><p>Coat Color: Any color, including white, black, red, brown, white, and lilac</p><p>Coat Patterns: Any pattern, including solid, bi-color, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, tuxedo, and pointed</p><p>Eye Color: Any possible feline eye color</p><p>Lifespan: 8 to 14 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Canada</p><h2>Sphynx Characteristics</h2><p>What the sphynx lacks in hair, it more than makes up for in personality. These peach-fuzz-coated cats are known for their exceptionally friendly, affectionate, and cuddly personalities. Many are dog-like in their desire to be close to their favorite humans whenever possible. They enjoy cuddling and other affectionate interactions, and they are rarely shy with new people, children, other cats, and even dogs.</p><p>These are very energetic cats that like to play and explore, but once playtime is over, they will unfailingly seek out a nearby lap for cuddling, or else a warm and sunny spot for a good catnap. While sphynx cats make wonderful family pets, these felines hate being alone for long, so if you cannot devote plenty of regular attention to your cat, the sphynx is not the right breed for you.</p><h2>History of the Sphynx Cat</h2><p>While the ancient Aztecs bred hairless cats hundreds of years ago, the sphynx cat we know today is actually a Canadian breed originating in Toronto in 1966 from a random genetic mutation. The mutation caused the kitten to be hairless. Some breeders took a liking to the hairless cat and decided to breed individuals that produced consistently hairless offspring.</p><p>Originally called the Canadian hairless, the breed made its way to America, and both American and Canadian breeders continued to develop the new breed, cross-breeding sphynx cats with Devon rex cats, another breed that has little hair. Over time, the sphynx cat was established as a new breed with its own breed standards.</p><p>The sphynx breed was recognized by The International Cat Association in 2005, the Cat Fanciers Association in 2002, and several independent cat clubs in Europe, though standards for the breed all differ slightly. The American Cat Fanciers' Association also recognizes the breed.</p><p>Some purebred feline registries will not recognize the sphynx cat based on the idea that the breed's hairlessness is a genetic abnormality that could be harmful to individual cats' health and longevity.</p><h2>Sphynx Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>You might assume that a cat with little-to-no fur wouldn't require much grooming, but in fact, the sphynx cat needs more grooming than many other normally furred breeds. Because they have no hair to absorb their body oils, the sphynx cat's skin must be washed regularly to maintain a healthy<br/>balance of oil and prevent skin problems and oil spots on furniture.</p><p>You should bathe your sphynx cat weekly or biweekly to remove oil build-up. Use a gentle shampoo formulated specifically for cats to avoid skin irritation or excessive dryness. Most breeders of sphynx cats accustom the kittens to regular baths, so the majority of these felines are quite agreeable to submersion in water, unlike many other breeds of felines.</p><p>Another area to focus on is your sphynx's ears. Due to the lack of fur, these cats tend to accumulate quite a bit of wax and dust inside their ears, which is both unsightly and potentially a source of infection. Use a cotton ball not a swab to gently remove wax and grime from your pet's ears once per week. If you notice redness, sores or scabs, excessive debris, or a bad smell, it's time for a call to your veterinarian.</p><p>Like any cat, your sphynx also needs regular nail trims and should have its teeth brushed regularly, as well.</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, sphynx cats are not completely hypoallergenic. They may look hairless, but these cats are actually covered in a very fine, suede-like coat. Doctors may, however, still recommend a sphynx cat as a solution for cat lovers who are searching for a breed that carries less allergens on their fur than others.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Sphynx cats are loyal and full of love for their humans and can often be spotted following them around or snuggling up while wagging their tail. Even though they would almost always rather be cuddling, sphynx cats are natural athletes and playful pals. Though sphynx cats are exceptionally active felines, their exercise needs are low.</p><p>These cats are happy to entertain themselves for hours at a time, but some might love to have a buddy. If you are away from home for most of the day, you might want to get two sphynx cats. Sphynxes get along with other pets, too, so you can rest easy knowing they will be happy if you have another animal they can snuggle with at home, including dogs. </p><p>Sphynx cats love to play, jump, and may even fetch once trained. Social and smart, sphynx cats respond well to positive reinforcement training.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>As with all purebred pets, always ask your breeder for a health guarantee for your sphynx kitten. When bred responsibly, sphynx cats have a generally healthy outlook.</p><p>Due to its hairlessness, Sphynx cats are sensitive to sun exposure as they have no fur to protect their skin from harmful UV rays. Their direct sun exposure should be limited, as just like humans, these cats can get a sunburn if exposed to sunlight for too long. For this reason, sphynxes should remain indoor pets or be monitored closely when outside.</p><p>Your sphynx should have annual health checkups with your veterinarian to detect potential health problems before they become serious. Of course, should your cat show signs of illness, it's always a good idea to contact your vet.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The most obvious and striking thing about a sphynx cat's appearance is its lack of fur. Note that these cats are not always completely bald, though; according to their breed standards, they can have a ""peach-fuzz"" coating of hair that is no more than 1/8-inch in length. They do typically all have a bit of short hair on the bridge of their nose and the backs of their ears. Most do not have whiskers, although they do have the characteristic whisker pads above the mouth.</p><p>The skin of a sphynx should have some wrinkles, especially around its shoulders and between its ears. The ears themselves are very large, giving the cat an ""elf-like"" expression. The eyes are also large and set fairly far apart on the animal's head. A sphynx cat's eyes can be any color genetically possible in felines, including blue, green, amber, orange, brown, yellow, or two different eye colors.</p>",1210

This distinguished dog breed has plenty of history and heart, and while it may share a resemblance with one of America's most popular dogs, this hound is much more than a larger Beagle. The hardworking foxhound is all-American despite its British and European heritage, and this leggy, vocal breed is best recognized for its melodious bay.</p><p>Historically speaking, the American foxhound was prized for its pack hunting prowess, and it was a favorite choice among hunters (particularly on horseback). In more recent years, the breed has found a place in family homes and hearts thanks to its easygoing and friendly nature. American foxhounds are particularly noted for being very patient with children, and they're great companions for active households. If you can meet the activity and environmental needs of this breed, you'll be delighted to have the loyal foxhound by your side.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 22 to 25 inches (males); 21 to 24 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 65 to 70 pounds (males); 60 to 65 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth coat</p><p>Coat Color: Combinations of white, black, and tan</p><p>Life Span: 11 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Sweet-tempered, active, independent, stubborn, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the American Foxhound</h2><p>As pack animals, American foxhounds aren't content to lead a solitary life. They crave companionship whether human or animal and do best in homes with people around for most of the day. Your foxhound will enjoy the company of other dogs when you're away from home.</p><p>When well-exercised and socialized, not much seems to rattle the foxhound. However, keep in mind that like all hounds, they were bred to work. These aren't lap dogs; they tend to have an independent temperament and can be shy or standoffish toward strangers. The best way to sum up the American foxhound's personality may be ""docile but reserved.""</p><p>The attributes that make the American foxhound a superb hunter are also a challenge for city life. The dogs possess a unique and far-reaching bay (a special hunting bark that more resembles a howl). This bay is particularly melodious, according to experts, but some foxhounds develop separation anxiety and bay excessively when left alone. Baying is an inherited behavior and can't be trained out of the dog. Hound enthusiasts love this unique bark, but it also means these dogs are best-suited to rural life.<br/></p><h2>History of the American Foxhound</h2><p>The origin story of the American foxhound starts across the pond. In 1650, English foxhounds were brought to colonial America from Britain by a man named Robert Brooks. However, the new frontier had its own topography and challenges, and it was recognized early on that the breed needed longer legs to cover the land and keep pace on a hunt. The English foxhound was bred with other European hounds in the United States, and the resulting hunting companion came to be known as the American foxhound.</p><p> As it turns out, America's founding father was also key to developing the American foxhound as we know it today. Later, the dogs were crossed with Irish hounds to create a speedier animal that could keep better pace with American foxes.</p><p>The American foxhound was first bred in Virginia and Maryland, and it received AKC recognition in 1886. As a nod to the breed's rich history in the area, Virginia made it the official state dog in 1966. Not generally known as a household pet, the American foxhound has been bred and prized for its sporting ability and seemingly endless stamina. The sport of foxhunting has greatly contributed to the breed's longevity. In fact, early American history shows that foxhunting was one of the most popular sports for the American gentry until the Civil War era. Even today, the sport is popular in equestrian society and relies on the participation of pack hounds many of which are the classic American foxhound.</p><h2>American Foxhound Care</h2><p>Understanding the nature of the American foxhound is key to living a happy life with this easygoing but energetic breed. These dogs need plenty of exercise every day to be satisfied, and they're known for stubbornly following their own desires (a trait that makes them excel when pursuing a scent on the hunt). In the grooming department, the American foxhound's short coat is easy to care for.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Owners should be aware that these dogs have boundless energy that needs a daily outlet to avoid undesirable behavior. It's important to remember that American foxhounds were bred for their speed and stamina. They have a seemingly limitless amount of energy, and this comes with significant daily exercise needs. Be prepared to spend up to two hours every day exercising your foxhound. It's best if you have a secure, fenced area for your dog to run in as a supplement to structured exercise time. These dogs love to be on the move, and if they're left alone in the house, they can become destructive when finding their own entertainment.</p><p>Like other scent hounds, the American foxhound has a keen sense of smell and a one-track mind when it gets on the trail of prey. For this reason, you should never trust your foxhound to walk off-leash especially in the city, where the threat of being hit by a car or becoming lost is even greater. This dog was bred to follow a scent and ignore everything else in its surroundings. This means that your foxhound is very unlikely to follow recall commands if it takes off after birds, cars, people, or other animals.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>One area where the foxhound is particularly low-maintenance is grooming. These dogs have a short, smooth coat that lies close to the body. The coarse hair doesn't become easily matted, but it does have a tendency to shed around the house. Owners should brush this breed about once per week to keep its coat healthy and reduce shedding. Bathe your foxhound on an as-needed basis when its fur becomes noticeably dirty.</p><p>Like other dog breeds, foxhounds should also have their teeth brushed, nails trimmed, and ears cleaned on a regular basis. Checking your dog's ears for debris each week and cleaning them monthly is especially important for this breed. Floppy ears hold in moisture, and this makes the foxhound easily susceptible to ear infections. If you notice signs like redness, irritation, swelling, or your dog pawing at its ears and shaking its head often, a trip to the vet should be scheduled as soon as possible to begin medication. Ear infections can progress quickly and become very painful. For dogs that have experienced multiple infections, owners should talk to a veterinarian to determine how often the ears should be cleaned.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The American foxhound has an independent streak that helps it excel in the field, but this can cause challenges in household settings. As a foxhound owner, you should make obedience training a priority from an early age when puppies are about eight weeks old. Otherwise, you may end up with a stubborn dog that resists learning the basics of house training or recall commands.</p><p>Positive reinforcement methods are effective for this breed. Training sessions should be kept short and performed frequently to keep the dog interested, as it's likely to wander off when training becomes boring. Avoid any methods that use punishment these are often counterproductive. Foxhounds have very sensitive personalities and may become fearful of their owners (and thus, less likely to obey their commands) if yelling is involved.</p>",1250

As their coats can come in a wide variety of colors and patterns, and their hair can be either short or long, it's the unique ears of American Curls that make them stand out among other cat breeds. Today, their backwards-curled ears are a desirable trait among breeders, but they were originally the product of a natural (and harmless) genetic mutation first identified in the United States during the 1980s.</p><p>But it's not only their curled ears that make these cats so special. Sometimes nicknamed the ""Peter Pan cat,"" these felines retain kitten-like natures into adulthood, and love to play, investigate, climb, and keep a close eye on their owners. They are very affectionate and easily accept children and other pets, making them an ideal family cat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Playful, friendly, affectionate, inquisitive, and easy going</p><p>Weight: Males weigh between 7 and 10 pounds, while females weigh less than 8 pounds.</p><p>Length: 18 to 20 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short haired or long haired</p><p>Coat Colors: Any possible feline color, including black, white, gray, brown, cream, or red</p><p>Coat Patterns: Any possible feline pattern, including solid, bi-color, tabby, tortoiseshell, tuxedo, and calico</p><p>Eye Color: Any possible feline color, including amber, aqua, blue, copper, green, gold, hazel, odd-eyed, orange, yellow</p><p>Life expectancy: Typically 10 to 18 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>American Curl Characteristics</h2><p>American Curls are friendly, affectionate, and active cats that are often said to have a somewhat ""doglike"" attachment to their owners. They like to gently poke and prod their humans with their paws and will often follow their favorite family members from room to room around the house. They are exceptionally intelligent cats as well. Some have been known to figure out how to flick light switches on and off, and many learn how to open and close doors and cupboards.</p><p>They typically retain a kitten-like playfulness throughout their entire lives and love to play with toys, climb and explore furniture and cat trees, investigate anything new brought into the home, and even play fetch. However, once playtime is over, your American Curl is likely to cuddle up on your lap, give you some affectionate head bumps, and spend some time in peaceful companionship.</p><p>It's important to note, however, that American Curls don't like to be left alone for too long so you might have to consider whether your schedule can accommodate several hours of attention and playtime each day.</p><p>These friendly felines aren't too large when fully grown, although they are somewhat muscular for their small-to-medium size. They generally reach maturity by one to two years of age. American Curls aren't especially talkative cats, tending towards quiet trills rather than loud meows. A sociable cat, most American Curls take readily to children and other pets in the home, especially if they offer extra opportunities for play and fun.</p><h2>History of the American Curl</h2><p>Despite their popularity, American Curls don't have a long history as a distinct breed. In fact, the first American Curl litter was born only a few decades ago in Southern California.</p><p>In 1981, founding breeders Joe and Grace Ruga adopted a stray, long-haired black kitten with the Curl's distinctive ears and named her Shulamith. Only a few months later, Shulamith gave birth to a litter of kittens, half of which had the same curled ears. By 1983, cat breeders were working hard to selectively breed cats to preserve and propagate this unique characteristic. Fortunately, genetics were on their side: A feline geneticist named Roy Robinson found that the ear-curling gene was a dominant trait, so cats with only one copy of the gene would be born with curled ears.</p><p>The American Curl became incredibly popular over a short period of time, and was quickly recognized by the International Cat Association in 1987 and by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1993. Today, American Curls are ranked 27th among the United States' most popular cat breeds.</p><h2>American Curl Care</h2><p>The frequency with which you groom your American Curl depends on its coat length. If your American Curl is short-haired, you can expect to groom its coat with a brush or comb once or twice weekly in order to keep it healthy and shiny. If your American Curl is long-haired, grooming should be increased to two or three times weekly, in order to remove any tangles, mats, or debris from the coat before it becomes a problem. Use a brush specifically designed for long-haired cats to avoid breaking or damaging the fur.</p><p>Like most cats, the American Curl is susceptible to ear issues, including ear mites. Be sure to check your Curl's ears weekly, and gently remove any dirt or debris with a dampened cloth or cotton round. Avoid using cotton swabs, as they can cause severe damage to your Curl's delicate inner-ear structures. If your Curl's ears are very dirty, red, inflamed, or smell funny, make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible. These symptoms may indicate infection or injury.</p><p>Regular dental hygiene can help protect your Curl from periodontal disease, so aim to brush its teeth several times per week. Daily brushing is ideal, but regular maintenance can support proper dental health. You can supplement brushing with plaque-removing treats, but give them to your Curl in moderation they're packed with additional calories and are meant only to support a regular dental hygiene routine.</p><p>The American Curl is intelligent and needs adequate exercise, so choose games that will challenge its mental and physical abilities. Try puzzles designed specifically for cats or games like hide and seek. Many Curls are also happy to play fetch with a small toy or rolled up piece of paper. The American Curl requires several hours of attention each day, so it's important to make sure your family's schedule can accommodate proper playtime before bringing a Curl into the home.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>American Curls are generally healthy and aren't predisposed to any specific genetic disorders. But as with any cat, the possibility always exists for your feline to develop some type of disease or condition during its lifetime.</p><p>Due to the unique shape of the American Curl's ears, some may be born with narrowed ear canals. These narrowed canals can trap wax, which can lead to ongoing ear infections. The opposite can also occur, where chronic ear infections lead to inflamed, narrow ear canals. Be sure to examine your Curl's ears every week to prevent or identify any ear or inner-ear issues. If you're concerned about the health of your Curl's ears, call your veterinarian for advice.</p>",1093

These dogs stand only about a foot tall but pack plenty of personality and adventure into their compact, muscular bodies. The JRT, as it's sometimes referred to, is both an agile hunting dog and a fun-loving family companion. But don't be fooled by the small size because these dogs have surprising stamina and willpower, so they can be a challenge for novice dog owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 15 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short coat that can be smooth or rough</p><p>COAT COLOR: White with black, tan, or brown markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 18 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, fearless, clownish, quirky, athletic, energetic</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>While Jack Russell terriers often make great family pets, it's important that they are taught proper obedience and that children are also taught proper boundaries. These dogs are playful and fun-loving, though, making them terrific companions for active families. However, their strong prey drive can be problematic in households with other small pets, including cats. It's important to socialize your JRT early and often for a well-balanced pet.</p><h2>History of the Jack Russell Terrier</h2><p>The Jack Russell terrier originated in England in the mid-to-late 1800s in response to a need for a small but feisty fox hunting dog. While foxhounds had gained much popularity among England's gentry for horse-and-hound hunting, a pastor named John Russell saw the need for a small terrier that could pursue the fox into the ground. As a result, he began a selective breeding program squarely aimed at developing a tenacious but tiny hunter.</p><p>There is little historical documentation of Russell's breeding programs. It seems that the pastor was an avid huntsman who was looking to create a fox hunting companion without realizing that he was going to become the originator of an entirely new breed. The most likely conclusion is that JRTs owe their existence to selective breeding of white terriers (now extinct) and English foxhounds. The resulting dogs were initially referred to as simply fox terriers, the term used for any fox hunting dogs of the day.</p><p>The Jack Russell terrier gained in popularity quickly, with a name inspired by the breed's founding father himself. The small but agile dogs were bred with speed they could keep up with horses on the chase. They also were built with trademark terrier tenacity. These dogs were successful in hunting foxes, raccoons, woodchucks, and other small game. They especially found a niche when used in conjunction with larger foxhounds. While the larger hunting dogs could pursue a fox until it retreated into its den, the smaller JRT could flush the fox from its hiding place and the chase could continue.</p><p>It also wasn't uncommon to see hunters sling this pocket-sized hunting dog into their saddlebags for long distances. With so much to offer in a small package, it's no surprise that Jack Russell's terriers soon became a breed of their own. In time, the JRT was brought to the United States. While the exact history is unclear, it appears that the breed was known stateside by the 1930s.</p><p>A devoted and loyal community of JRT owners sprang up, and the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America was formed in 1976. The organization was established to promote and protect the breed and continues to maintain the breed's official registry. The JRTCA focuses on preserving the breed's working heritage and is strongly positioned against AKC or any other kennel club registration.</p><p>However, not all enthusiasts of the breed have shared the JRTCA's approach. Some JRT owners were in favor of AKC recognition. In 1997, the AKC recognized a new breed known as the Parson Russell terrier. Jack Russell terriers that met a specific set of criteria for the new breed standard became eligible for registration with the AKC. Another derivative of the JRT, the smaller Russell terrier, also gained AKC recognition in 2012. </p><p>Jack Russell terrier purists stand by the JRCTA and their breed standard and registry. The club hosts competitions throughout the year to provide breed enthusiasts an opportunity to highlight their terrier's strengths and earn recognition from the breed community. Trials include conformation, go-to-ground, trailing and locating, racing, agility, and obedience. </p><h2>Jack Russell Terrier Care</h2><p>If you're thinking about adding a Jack Russell terrier to your family, be prepared to expend the energy necessary to keep this bouncy pup happy and well-balanced. Jack Russell terrier puppies are almost too cute for words, but these pups grow into active and athletic dogs that require a major commitment in terms of exercise, mental stimulation, and training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>No discussion of the care of a Jack Russell terrier would be complete without strong advice regarding exercise. These dogs may be small, but they have major exercise needs. Don't confuse the JRT with your average lap dog. While they do make great family dogs that love human companionship, they were bred to hunt. A dog that is only 10 to 15 inches tall but was bred to run with horses will give you an idea of what type of activity outlet these canines crave.</p><p>Plan to give your JRT about 90 minutes of vigorous exercise daily depending on age, which should include several substantial walks a day. Runners looking for a jogging companion will be surprised to find that the tiny Jack Russell terrier makes a capable partner. In addition, it's almost imperative that you have a yard to let your little terrier run and stretch its legs. The JRT also has an impressive vertical this breed can jump up to 5 feet high. So be sure that any enclosure is of sufficient height to prevent escape. Also keep in mind that these dogs have a reputation for being notorious diggers, so make sure that you don't allow digging escapades to turn into a terrier great escape.</p><p>The Jack Russell terrier excels at agility work and go-to-ground trials. The latter are timed trials that test the speed and agility of this working breed as it completes a tunnel course.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming is fairly simple with a Jack Russell terrier. The short coat is easily combed to remove loose hair and an occasional bath will keep dirt and dander under control. The coat of a Jack Russel terrier can be smooth or rough, which is wiry in appearance. A third coat is referred to as broken and is a combination of smooth and rough patches of fur. Like all dogs, give regular attention to nail trimming and ear cleaning to keep this dog happy and healthy. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Jack Russell terrier is extremely smart which makes it easy to train. They quickly learn tricks but can also be quite naughty. It's imperative that you instill proper pack order in the mind of your dog from an early age and set clear boundaries within the house. Obedience work can also be a great challenge for the mind and heart of the JRT. However, a heavy hand and overbearing manner won't bring out the best in this friendly dog. Instead, use short, frequent training sessions to engage the active mind of your JRT and positive reinforcement to train your dog to work alongside you not against you.</p>",1195

The intelligence and sociable nature possessed by these stately canines make them outstanding companions.

However, it's not a passive pet that you can just leave to its own devices. Be sure that you understand the nature and needs of a schnauzer before you bring one home.</p><h2>History of the Standard Schnauzer</h2><p>The end of the Middle Ages saw the beginning of the bearded Bavarian farm dog today known as the schnauzer. Originating in Germany sometime during the 15<sup>th</sup>century, these adaptable and hardworking dogs served as an indispensable part of farm life. Their medium size also made them ideal for taking goods to market. The breed was compact enough to sit in the wagon but wouldn't hesitate to ward off thieves with a booming bark and a bite if the intruder didn't get the hint.</p><p>Back at home, schnauzers were tasked with hunting vermin and other small prey, guarding against intruders, and assisting in herding activities. As a result, these dogs developed a watchful attitude, a keen prey drive, and a steady disposition. Today, they retain the drive of a dog bred to work but also relish their role as a family companion.</p><p>Interestingly, the schnauzer was originally known as the wire-haired pinscher and considered to be the same breed as the dog we today know as a German pinscher. In the early 1900s, the wire-haired pinscher established its own identity as a distinct breed and left the pinscher name behind. The name 'schnauzer' is taken from the German word for muzzle or snout and with such a distinctive wiry beard, it's not hard to see why this became the defining feature and moniker for the breed.</p><p>Around this time, breed enthusiasts introduced grey keeshonds and black poodles to solidify the coat colors carried in the genes of schnauzers today: salt and pepper, and black. As the schnauzer staked its place in the dog breed world, fanciers began breeding miniature and giant versions, although the medium size of the standard schnauzer is often described by people as just right for any activity.</p><p>The reliability of the schnauzer breed has been put to use in police work, bomb detection, and search and rescue work. During World War I and World War II, schnauzers assisted the troops and also worked with the Red Cross.</p><p>As early as 1904, the AKC recognized the schnauzer but the breed remained relatively rare in the United States. After World War I, schnauzers were imported to the United States with greater frequency than in the decades preceding the war. In 1925, a breed club was created to represent the interests of the breed and serve as a protector and ambassador. It was known as the Schnauzer Club of America, which later divided into the Standard Schnauzer Club of America and a separate organization for miniature schnauzers the American Miniature Schnauzer Club.  </p><h2>Standard Schnauzer Care</h2><p>The schnauzer approaches life with a focused mentality and is ever alert. At the same time, this breed learns quickly and adapts readily to its owner. The schnauzer needs an outlet for its energy, but when properly exercised and engaged, the breed is neither characteristically hyperactive nor overly lethargic. This companion dog should not be left to fend for itself. They are very smart and sociable, so they crave interaction with their human companions. Plenty of exercise, frequent training sessions, and opportunities for play will tire both the mind and body of the schnauzer.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>A standard schnauzer will benefit from exercise that includes at least one long walk daily, plus several shorter outings, and play sessions that total about an hour a day. Some schnauzer owners report that their dogs have excellent recall and never stray far off-leash but use caution in deciding whether to let your schnauzer roam free. The safest course is to only let your dog off-leash in a fenced area. </p><p>Schnauzers make great jogging partners, will be up for a hike, and also enjoy canine competitions like agility, rally, and obedience. Training for such events also allows the schnauzer to fulfill its need to work with you and for you. At the same time, lots of schnauzer owners love that their dogs are always happy to curl up on the couch and spend time relaxing with their owners.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The schnauzer's characteristic double coat requires some TLC to keep it looking great. Regular brushing of the fur is important to keep mats from forming and to keep the eyebrows, beard, and leg feathering free of debris. Many schnauzer owners lament how drippy and dirty the beard of a schnauzer can become from eating and drinking. Be sure to regularly wipe your schnauzer's beard to help reduce odors and discoloration.</p><p>Schnauzers are non-shedding and are sometimes better tolerated by allergy sufferers. However, since the hair grows continuously, regular grooming is required to keep the coat in check. There are two ways to approach grooming schnauzer: hand stripping or clipping.</p><p>It may take some searching to find a groomer that can hand strip (pluck/remove dead hairs by hand) your schnauzer. However, purists of the breed recommend this over the more common clipper method of grooming. Using clippers on a schnauzer's coat gradually reduces the wiry top layer of fur and reduces the coat's resistance to water and debris, along with changing the color and appearance. Hand stripping might be more expensive or difficult to find, but it should be noted that doing so leads to slower hair re-growth. You can expect up to five or six months in between hand stripping sessions versus the six to eight weeks between clipping sessions. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Keep in mind that mental engagement is a critical part of the training and care for a standard schnauzer. As a working dog, the schnauzer thrives when it has a task to do. Unlike many high-energy sporting breeds, it's not just a matter of giving your schnauzer a good physical workout. These dogs also need to find fulfillment in using their intelligence and work ethic. If this is overlooked, they will find their own work to be done which can include destructive behaviors or becoming too territorial over people and property.</p><p>However, schnauzers raised by responsible dog owners are known for having well-rounded and reliable personalities. They have an innate alertness and will be quick to sound the alarm over perceived intruders, but they are not generally known to be excessive barkers (especially when compared to the miniature schnauzer). They may regard newcomers with wariness, but will be put at ease when they see these guests warmly welcomed by the pack leader.</p><p>Balance is the important thing when training a schnauzer. If you include the right ratio of exercise, training, and mental stimulation, these dogs blossom into wonderful companions. Just be sure that you maintain your position as the pack leader, since the intelligence of this breed can quickly lead to dominance or stubborn tendencies.</p>",1255

For a calm and steady companion by your side, look no further than this well-mannered breed. The Clumber spaniel is often described as dignified and determined; they make excellent family pets and reliable hunting dogs.</p><p>The largest of the game-flushing spaniels, the Clumber is a solidly built dog whose low stature belies its substantial size. Built to barrel through the underbrush and overcome tricky terrain, the Clumber spaniel is not keen on speed but unstoppable on the scent of a bird.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 18 to 20 inches (males); 17 to 19 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 70 to 85 pounds (males); 55 to 70 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, straight to wavy, and soft coat</p><p>Coat Color: White, often with yellow or orange markings</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, friendly, sweet-tempered, gentle, calm</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Clumber Spaniel</h2><p>Clumber spaniels do best in the company of other pets and their human families. Highly trainable and having a friendly personality toward new people, this breed is a great choice for owners that socialize often and spend lots of time at home. Clumber spaniels are often noted for being loyal and patient with kids, but their sturdy size could inadvertently knock down small children, so proper supervision is necessary. Thankfully, their calm temperament and quiet nature make them great companions around the house. These dogs are also known for their floppy, drool-prone jowls, so owners should prepare for messy kisses from this loving spaniel.</p><h2>History of the Clumber Spaniel</h2><p>The origin of the Clumber spaniel is subject to speculation, but it's likely that England can lay claim to this stately breed. This spaniel has been in existence since the 1700s when it was in high demand among nobility looking for hunting companions to flush birds. It's thought that the breed as we know it today was first developed from Alpine spaniels (now extinct), Basset hounds, and Saint Bernards. Since the Clumber has hound-like features, a spaniel's instinct to flush and retrieve bird game, and the steady and devoted disposition of Saint Bernards, it's not hard to see how this heritage is within the realm of possibility.</p><p>Clumber spaniels get their name from Clumber Park, located in Nottinghamshire, England. The Duke of Newcastle relied upon them as gun dogs. His gamekeeper, William Mansel, played a significant role in advancing the breed. Clumbers were kept by British nobility and breeding was restricted to these estates.</p><h2>Clumber Spaniel Care</h2><p>The Clumber spaniel is an adaptable and easygoing companion, but it needs considerable time and effort from its family to thrive. To keep these dogs happy and healthy, owners need to understand and fulfill their grooming, exercise, and social needs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bred to be in the field, these dogs enjoy putting their minds and bodies to work. Provide your Clumber spaniel with at least 30 minutes to an hour of exercise per day. One long walk or two shorter walks should keep your spaniel content to lounge indoors. While they're not likely to be speedsters, they can enjoy competing in agility, obedience, and rallies. They're also avid retrievers, so a solid game of fetch will put this bird dog in its element.</p><p>Take note that while Clumber spaniels are confident and self-assured, they were bred to be hunting companions that work in a pack. As such, they're not well-suited to be left alone outdoors all day. In fact, if Clumbers are left alone for excessively long periods, they can become anxious or destructive.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>While this breed isn't a heavy shedder, its medium-length hair is prone to shedding all year long (with heavier fallout during the winter and spring). Brush your Clumber with a slicker brush several times a week to keep shedding to a minimum. It's also important for owners to brush their dog's teeth, trim their nails, and check their ears for dirt and debris. Clean the ears with a dog-safe ear cleaner as needed to prevent infections.</p><p>One thing you may not know about the Clumber is that this breed is known for drooling. Clumber kisses come with plenty of slobber thanks to the breed's flappy flews (the canine equivalent of upper lips). However, the dog hair and an occasional dollop of drool are the most significant considerations when it comes to Clumber spaniel care. With regular baths, an average amount of exercise, and plenty of love, you'll have a well-balanced and healthy dog to share your home with.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Clumber spaniel is known for its intelligent and easily trainable nature. When it comes to basic obedience, these dogs excel without too much extra effort from their owners. Simple lessons can begin when puppies are as young as six weeks old, but more advanced training can continue through your dog's life. This breed is eager to learn and responds well to positive reinforcement methods that don't involve punishment.</p><p>As with any dog breed, provide proper socialization for your Clumber spaniel early in life to ensure that they're friendly toward people, children, and other animals. When it comes to stranger danger, the Clumber spaniel isn't overly shy about new faces, but it also isn't quick to sound the alarm. In fact, Clumbers are a relatively quiet breed that isn't known for barking often.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>A breed with a long pedigreed history, the Clumber spaniel isn't overly plagued by health problems, but it is susceptible to a few common conditions. Some of these concerns can be mitigated with testing, like hip and elbow evaluations, an ophthalmology exam, and PDP1 testing for a rare genetic enzyme deficiency.</p><p>You should also know that the Clumber spaniel has an affinity for carrying things in its mouth, thanks to its bird retrieving instincts. This can easily lead to the dog ingesting a foreign object that causes health complications and may even require surgery. Teach your Clumber not to chew on household objects and only provide safe toys for your pet to play with or chew on.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Ask any Clumber spaniel owner, and they'll likely tell you that these dogs are opportunistic eaters. These spaniels take advantage of food left unattended on counters or tables, and despite their somewhat short stature, they're surprisingly skilled at overcoming vertical challenges to steal a snack.</p><p>Feed your Clumber spaniel in moderation with high-quality dog food. They're food-motivated, so treats can be an effective training incentive-but don't overfeed these dogs. With the breed's long, low stance, weight gain can cause excessive strain on the back and lead to problems like IVDD or joint strain. Ask your veterinarian to help you determine a healthy meal plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p>",1124

This striking sheepdog is closely related to the other three shepherds native to Belgium: the Groenendael, Malinois, and Tervuren. However, the Laekenois stands apart thanks to its unique coat. While its name looks like a tongue-twister, it is simply pronounced ""Lak-in-wah.""</p><p>The personality and work ethic of these dogs make them outstanding protectors, but affectionate companions. At the same time, this is not a dog breed for the novice owner. They require abundant mental and physical exertion to keep their inner working-dog persona satisfied. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 24 to 26 inches (males); 22 to 24 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium length double coat with wiry, curly texture</p><p>Coat Color: Red, fawn, or gray with traces of black on muzzle or tail</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, protective, intelligent, active, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Belgium</p><h2>Characteristics of the Belgian Laekenois</h2><p>The Laekenois is known to be incredibly loving and attached to its family members, including children. It isn't known to have an aggressive personality toward strangers, but it is best described as very wary of them.</p><p>The breed standard of Laekenois dogs describes their temperament as watchful, attentive and always in motion when not under command. Owners report that these alert and sensitive dogs are hyper-aware of anything novel in their environment-including objects, people, noises, and more. This constant motion can be especially challenging during puppyhood and adolescence, while your dog is still learning to settle and control impulses.</p><p>While the training and care of a Laekenois is a lot of work, these dogs make wonderful companions for the right household. Their intelligence makes them a delight to work with, and they live to please their owners. You just need to be sure that you have the time, patience, and interest in devoting several hours each day to this dog and its exercise requirements.</p><h2>History of the Belgian Laekenois</h2><p>Originating in Belgium, the Laekenois was developed in a group of native herding breeds centuries ago. These dogs served as guardians of livestock, especially cattle and sheep. At the same time, they enjoyed close cooperation and companionship with their families. As a result, this Belgian shepherd developed into a capable working dog and a keen guardian of people and property.</p><p>In the 1890s, the Belgian shepherds were for the first time identified into four main types: the Groenendael (or Belgian sheepdog), the Malinois, the Tervuren, and the Laekenois. It should be noted that the four types shared a very similar stature and temperament; the defining factor for each type came down to coat.</p><h2>Belgian Laekenois Care</h2><p>This rare and striking breed originated with work to do. While your Laekenois might be several generations and thousands of miles removed from a sheepfold in Belgium, the mentality of this dog is ever alert and always on. If you don't give them enough activity and attention, they can become neurotic, destructive, and willful. While it requires less time than exercise and training, grooming these dogs is also a weekly job.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>It's no surprise that exercise is paramount for the health and mental wellbeing of a Laekenois. Plan to give this dog about two hours of your attention each day, divided between physical outlets and mental engagement. It's been said that you can't out-exercise a Belgian shepherd, so you must do your best to give them a physical outlet, then mentally tire them with training.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming a Laekoenois regularly is important, though not overly time-consuming. With a tousled coat about 2 1/2 inches in length, you will need to brush your dog at least weekly to prevent matting and remove debris. You should not clip the coat, since doing so damages the double layer of fur that acts as a natural regulator for body temperature. </p><p>Like all dogs, your Laekenois will also need to have its teeth brushed, nails trimmed, and ears checked regularly for dirt and debris that can lead to infection. Clean the ears as needed using a cotton ball dipped in a cleaning solution specifically for the ears.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>While some breeds are said to mature slowly and retain their puppyhood for several years, the Laekenois has been described as fast to mature if given the opportunity to learn. They do exceptionally well at obedience training, which should start when puppies are six to eight weeks old. This sets an excellent stage for advanced training down the road.</p><p>Obedience work will help to strengthen the bond between you and your powerful shepherd while establishing that you are the pack leader. This is important since the Laekenois has a strong sense of duty when it comes to guarding people and property. If you lose the top spot in this dog's mind, you lose the ability to control its impulses and actions. As soon as your puppy has had sufficient vaccinations for public outings, begin introducing him or her to as many people, animals, and situations as you can. Doing so from an early age will increase your dog's adaptability.</p><p>Laekenois owners often report that their dog's wariness of unfamiliar people or dogs is heightened at night. They tend to evaluate strange faces to assess the threat level, and they won't hesitate to guard against intruders. This underscores the reason why the Laekenois, like other Belgian shepherds, requires early socialization and ongoing training.</p><p>This breed does well with other animals as long as it's been properly introduced. Since the breed originated to protect other animals, it doesn't have a strong prey drive. However, its herding nature makes these dogs somewhat mouthy, and they may try to herd people and animals. When overstimulated and under-exercised, this tendency can make them more liable to bite.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Laekenois is considered to be relatively healthy. However, as a large breed dog, there are a few problems that the Laekenois should be screened for. Responsible breeders will test parent dogs before breeding and provide prospective adopters with the litter's family medical history.</p><p>The American Belgian Laekenois Association recommends the following evaluations: hip and elbow, cardiac exam, thyroid exam, ophthalmologist evaluation, and a dentition exam.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like any other breed, it's important to feed a Belgian Laekenois a diet of high-quality dog food with treats given sparingly. Too many treats or table scraps can negatively impact your dog's weight and long-term health.</p><p>In addition, the concerns of dental health in this breed make it advisable to skip wet food and feed only hard, crunchy kibble that will help keep plaque from developing. Choose a diet that avoids any of your dog's food allergies and consult your veterinarian to determine healthy portion sizes based on age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Belgian Laekenois</h2><p>Adopting a Laekenois puppy won't necessarily mean importing a dog from Belgium-although it might. The number of breeders in the United States is still very limited. It's essential to perform diligent research about breeders and come prepared with a list of questions regarding the lineage and temperament of a litter's parents. The attributes of a puppy can be strongly influenced by the temperament of the line they are bred from, and this can also greatly affect their long-term health. Laekenois puppies from breeders typically cost between $650 and $2,500 depending on availability and pedigree.</p><h2>Belgian Laekenois Overview</h2><p>Alert and watchful</p><p>Affectionate with family members</p><p>Excels in many canine sports; highly trainable</p><p>Requires hours of daily exercise and training</p><p>Can become restless and vocal when bored</p><p>Guarding instincts may lead to aggression</p>",1243

This Irish terrier was born and bred to work, and they have all the typical terrier tenacities, which makes them effective hunters but sometimes challenging canine companions.</p><p>Born an inky black color, the soft and wavy coat of the Kerry Blue is considered to be progressive gray. This means that, by the age of 18 months, the coat will gradually lighten, reaching a shade of gray ranging from a dark slate to a light blue-gray. In between, the coat may change color several times, including developing patches of brown fur that eventually fade into a uniformly gray coat. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 19 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 30 to 40 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short coat that is soft and wavy with no undercoat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Blue-gray in color upon maturing</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, alert, attentive, bright</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Ireland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Kerry Blue Terrier</h2><p>Kerry Blue terriers are the perfect dog option for owners looking for a pup that is personality-packed but relaxed. They are just as happy to chill with you on the couch as they are being put to work on a farm. Their distinctive look is sure to turn heads and they will be a loyal companion for years to come.</p><h2>History of the Kerry Blue Terrier</h2><p>The history of the Kerry Blue is mostly uncertain-for all practical purposes, it seems as if the dog just appeared on the coast of southwest Ireland at least 150 years ago. Plenty of tales abound as to how the breed may have come to be, including accounts of a shipwrecked dog with a blue coat swimming ashore.</p><p>The truth is, no one knows how this type of dog was developed, but the sturdy breed quickly became part of life in Kerry County, Ireland. The dogs became such a fixture in the community that it was natural for the breed to bear the name &lsquo;Kerry' in recognition of the county from which it originated.</p><p>Farmers relied on the Kerry Blue as an all-around working dog. They were often used to herd sheep and cattle, along with hunting mice, rats, and rabbits on the property. There's also reason to believe that, in the early days of the breed's history, peasants used these terriers to hunt small game on the property of nobility-who used much larger Irish Wolfhounds to guard their land.</p><p>Some have suggested that the Kerry Blue was bred from other terriers, including the Bedlington Terrier, Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier, or Irish Terrier. Irish Wolfhounds may have also played a role in the breed's development.</p><h2>Kerry Blue Terrier Care</h2><p>Kerry Blue Terriers take slightly above-average care when it comes to training and grooming. Their stubborn nature will mean that patience is key when instilling obedience and good behavior in your dog. Likewise, the unique coat that they've become known for needs to be properly cared for in order to look its best.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Exercise is key to the health and happiness of these dogs. They make excellent jogging companions and they can go the distance, despite their relatively compact size. At the very least, you should expect to take your Kerry Blue on several long walks a day. They also benefit from having a yard but can be prone to digging, so you'll have to keep a close eye on that behavior.</p><p>If you're looking for a sporty canine that excels in competition, this dog breed makes a great choice. They're eager to please and have plenty of energy to channel into dog sports, such as agility competitions. Obedience-work will also put the mind and heart of the Kerry Blue to work.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The importance of grooming the Kerry Blue's soft, wavy coat can't be dismissed. The fine hair easily becomes matted and is prone to collecting sticks, burrs, and other debris. You'll need to brush your Kerry at least every other day, though many breed experts advise a daily brushing session. On the plus side, the Kerry's coat is non-shedding, leading many to consider them a hypoallergenic breed.</p><p>You will also need to have this breed professionally groomed on a regular basis. The coat grows continuously, so a trip to the groomer will keep this terrier looking trim and tidy. Typically, every six weeks is enough to keep the terrier's coat in check.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>When properly trained and socialized, the Kerry Blue is loyal, obedient, and athletic. These dogs are highly alert and can make a good watchdog. They also are a sturdy play companion for older children but may not be as well-suited for a home with young children. Keep in mind that these feisty terriers were bred to hunt small vermin like mice and rabbits-so their prey drive tends to be strong. They aren't typically recommended for homes with cats or other small animals, though early socialization and training can offset this natural tendency.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Kerry Blue is a relatively hearty breed, but it does have several health problems you should be aware of. The National Breed Club recommends hip and eye evaluations and many breeders also perform DNA testing to screen for hereditary health problems.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Kerry Blue terrier has dietary requirements similar to any other dog. Feed it a high-quality, well-balanced diet to maintain your dog's health and weight. Like many other breeds, some Kerry Blues suffer from allergies, so be sure to choose a formula that is free of fillers and features a quality source of animal protein. </p><h2>Where to Adopt of Buy a Kerry Blue Terrier</h2><p>Kerry Blue terriers enjoy a loyal and devoted community in the United States. If you're looking for a breeder, it's normal to be put on a waiting list, but there are generally puppies available throughout the year. The breeder should be able to answer any questions you have regarding the pedigree, health, and history of the litter and its parents.

8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/himalayan-cat-breed-profile-4691062,Cats > Cat Breeds > Long-Haired Cat Breeds,"<h1>Himalayan: Cat Breed Profile, Characteristics & Care</h1>","<h1>Himalayan: Cat Breed Profile, Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>Appearance, Personality, History, Care, & Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>Himalayan cats, also known as ""Himmies,"" are a hybrid breed of Persian and Siamese cats first developed in the United States. The result is a beautiful feline with a long, silky, Persian-like coat and Siamese-like pointed coloring on the ears, tail, face, and paws. Their bright blue eyes are also a nod to their Siamese ancestry.</p><p>Despite their larger size, Himalayans can be considered a ""gentle giant"" of the feline world. They adore the attention and affection of their owners, have sweet, temperate personalities, and are very playful. If you're looking for a low-maintenance cat, however, a Himalayan may not be the right pick for you their long, silky coats require daily care.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Himmy</p><p>Personality: Sedate, affectionate, gentle, friendly, and intelligent</p><p>Weight: 7 to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: 12 to 16 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Long hair</p><p>Coat Color: White to cream</p><p>Coat Patterns: Pointed markings, which can be a wide range of colors including chocolate, seal, blue, lilac, and red</p><p>Eye Color: Blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Himalayan Characteristics</h2><p>Himmies are gentle, somewhat sedate cats, but don't think that makes them boring. These felines enjoy playing with toys, although they aren't likely to go wild climbing your curtains like some other breeds. They are intelligent and very attuned to their owners, often greeting them at the door after an absence. Himalayan cats love to cuddle, be petted, and spend time interacting with their family.</p><p>These medium-to-large, sociable cats generally get along well with children, as long as they aren't too boisterous, and can settle in very well to a home with other cats and cat-friendly dogs.</p><h2>History of the Himalayan</h2><p>Unlike many other breeds, Himalayans don't have a very long history. They've existed for less than 100 years, but attempts to breed a long-haired Siamese stretched over decades.</p><p>Through the 1920s and 1930s, breeders around the world attempted to produce a cat with a Persian body and Siamese markings. In 1935, two medical researchers from Harvard cross-bred a black, Persian male with a Siamese female to study how certain genetic characteristics were inherited. After creating and cross-breeding several litters, these researchers finally produced the first true long-haired Siamese, which they named Newton's Debutante.</p><p>Breeding slowed during World War II, but following the war, an American breeder named Marguerita Goforth continued working towards a Siamese-Persian cross. Her attempts to bring recognition to the Himalayan as a new breed were successful, as in 1957, this hybrid was officially recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and the American Cat Fanciers' Association (ACFA).</p><p>However, several years later, the Cat Fanciers' Association dropped recognition of the Himalayan as a truly separate breed, instead recognizing it as a division of the Persian. Today, many organizations still do not consider Himalayans and Persians to be distinctly separate breeds.</p><h2>Himalayan Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>If you're not willing to dedicate some time to grooming each day, the Himalayan probably isn't the right cat for you. Because they have long, silky hair that tangles and mats easily, a Himalayan's coat should be brushed with a sturdy, wide-toothed comb daily. This will help prevent tangling and mats, and also remove any dirt, dust, or debris, along with loose hair. It's also recommended that a Himalayan visits a professional groomer every few months to ensure its coat is healthy and clean. The good news: Himalayans love to get attention from their owners, which makes grooming easier and an excellent bonding experience for both the owner and Himalayan.</p><p>You can protect your furniture by trimming your Himalayan's nails regularly, removing just the tip of the claw so as not to cut into the quick. Dedicate some time each week to examine your cat's ears, too. If you find debris in your cat's ears, use a pet ear cleaner and cotton ball to gently remove it. use a cotton swab in your cat's ears it can cause serious damage to the delicate inner-ear structures. If the ears are very red or inflamed, very dirty, or smell bad, take it to the veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><p>Like other short-faced cat breeds, Himalayans are prone to tear-staining, called epiphora. This can leave unattractive reddish-brown stains on your cat's face. If this is an issue with your feline, gently wipe its face once or twice a day with a soft, damp cloth to remove the excess tears before they create stains. If the color persists, ask your vet to recommend a product specifically formulated to remove the stains. There are many sold over-the-counter.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Himalayans have low exercise needs, but they are extremely playful and will get into mischief if they become bored. You can keep them entertained and engaged by providing plenty of cat toys and dedicating a few minutes to playtime each day. Because Himalayans have such playful personalities, something as simple as a ball of paper will keep them entertained for hours.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like Persians, Himalayans are more prone than many other breeds to several health conditions. It's very important to ask for proof of health from the breeder if you are planning on purchasing a purebred Himalayan kitten. While this does not guarantee that your cat won't develop health issues, it can give you some indication of potentially inheritable conditions the kitten's parents might have passed on to their offspring.</p><p>Be sure to talk to your veterinarian about the best ways to reduce your Himalayan's risk of these health conditions. They'll be able to provide active steps you can take to protect it, as well as an action plan if a health condition does arise.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Medium to large in size, the stocky, thick-bodied Himalayan cat has a wide, deep chest, a rounded abdomen, and sturdy bones. A healthy Himalayan should feel muscular and solid, but not overly chubby. Their head is somewhat large in proportion to their body size, with a snubbed nose, flattened face, small ears, and large, wide-set blue eyes. Their tail is not long, but is exceptionally fluffy.</p><p>Of course, it's the gorgeous coat and coloring that truly makes the Himalayan stand out. The fur is long and flowing, with a tendency to mat if not frequently groomed. The body of a Himalayan is white to cream in color, with darker ""points"" on the face, ears, tail, and legs. There are several accepted colors of the points, including lilac, chocolate, seal, red, and blue. It is also acceptable to the breed standards for the points but not the rest of the cat's body to have tabby or tortoiseshell patterns.</p><p>The cat's eyes should be a vivid blue, and its nose and paw pads should match its point color.</p><p>The Himalayan is definitely not a hypoallergenic cat, and is prone to considerable shedding without regular grooming.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your cat's nutritional needs depend on its age, weight, and activity levels, so it's important to talk to your veterinarian about its feeding schedule. Because Himalayans are susceptible to hairballs their long, silky coats are highly prone to shedding you might want to ask your vet about a food specially formulated to prevent or reduce hairballs.</p><p>Feline obesity is a common problem among all breeds, so be careful not to overfeed your cat during regular mealtimes or with treats. If your cat is gaining excessive weight, your veterinarian can provide a customized diet plan.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Himalayan</h2><p>Himmies are very popular, so it is possible that you can find one in a cat rescue or shelter if you are persistent in your search. Check out pet-adoption websites like Petfinder for breed-specific adoptions, but be aware that you'll mostly find mixes, rather than purebred cats, in a shelter.</p>",1250

These friendly, active cats are known for being very loyal-in fact, their loyalty is often compared to that of dogs-and they are also both intelligent and affectionate.</p><p>These curious and playful felines love to cuddle, but can be mischievous as well. Because they are generally quite outgoing and even-tempered, they are a good fit for households with children, other cats, or even dogs. However, they need more grooming than you might expect, and they do not like to be left alone for long stretches of time.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Don Sphynx, Russian Hairless</p><p>Personality: Affectionate, curious, playful, intelligent, and friendly</p><p>Weight: 6 to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Bald or slight fuzz</p><p>Coat Color: Skin can be any color found in felines</p><p>Coat Patterns: Skin can have any pattern found in felines</p><p>Eye Color: Any color found in felines</p><p>Lifespan: 12 to 15+ years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Russia</p><h2>Donskoy Characteristics</h2><p>The first thing you'll notice about a Donskoy cat is its appearance. The next thing is likely to be its outgoing, friendly, and curious personality. These cats are almost dog-like in their enthusiasm for time spent with their humans, as well as their ability to be trained to come to their name, walk on a leash, or even perform simple tricks. They are very affectionate, as well, and love to cuddle, be petted, or sneak into your bed for a nap.</p><p>A medium-sized cat with a muscular build, the Donskoy, despite not normally having fur, is not a hypoallergenic breed. They are good-natured cats that get along well with humans young and old, other felines, and most dogs. They do need plenty of your time and affection, however, so are not the best choice for a home that is often empty.</p><h2>History of the Donskoy Cat</h2><p>Donskoy cats were first discovered in the late 1980s by Elena Kovaleva, a professor of the State Pedagogical Institute, in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. Kovaleva rescued a kitten from a group of boys who were mistreating it. She took the female kitten home and named it Varvara. After a few months, Varvara began losing her hair. Thinking the baldness was due to a health problem, Kovaleva attempted numerous treatments on her kitten's skin to no avail.</p><p>Varvara mated with a local tomcat and produced a litter of kittens a few years later, and the litter included both hairless and haired offspring. However, the kittens with hair eventually began to lose it, thus causing people to believe that their hair loss was caused by some sort of illness. There was little interest in the cats and people encouraged Kovaleva to get rid of them since they appeared to be unhealthy.</p><p> When a professional breeder named Irina Nemikina rescued one of the kittens and began a breeding program with it, the hairless coats continued with subsequent litters, thus confirming that it is an inherited genetic mutation, not an illness, that leads to the fur loss. Nemikina's breeding efforts created a new cat breed, which she named the Don Sphynx - Don for the nearby Don River and Sphynx as a nod to the cats' resemblance to the other breed of hairless cat.</p><h2>Donskoy Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because they're hairless (or nearly hairless), Donskoys have unique grooming needs. They won't need to be brushed, but Donskoy owners will need to wipe down their cats daily whenever possible with a soft, damp towel, as their body produces oils but doesn't have enough hair to absorb it. Full baths should be given once every month or two, using a gentle shampoo formulated specifically for cats.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These are very active cats, and they love to play, run, and jump. Your Donskoy will generally take care of its own exercise needs, however, as long as you provide plenty of toys, cat trees or similar climbing opportunities, and boxes or cat play tunnels for diving, leaping, and exploring. Still, it's always fun, and a good opportunity for bonding, to take some time each day to interact directly with your cat in a vigorous play session. Your Donskoy will love to chase a tossed crinkle ball, leap for a ""cat dancer"" feather on a string, or race after you as you drag a ribbon behind you while running through the house.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>With patience, repetition, and plenty of small treats, you can teach your Donskoy to come to its name, perform simple tricks, and walk on a leash. These intelligent cats learn quickly and are rather dog-like in their desire to interact with their humans.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>For the most part, Donskoys are healthy cats. However, because of their hairless bodies, sunburn, sensitivity to hot and cold weather, and other skin issues are potential concerns. These cats have also been associated with certain dental issues, such as tooth decay and gum disease, so tooth brushing is a must.</p><p>Today, not all cat registries recognize the Donskoy, mostly due to concerns about the genetic health of this particular breed. The dominant genetic mutation that causes hairlessness in both Donskoys and Peterbalds could potentially also cause feline ectodermal dysplasia, which is a complex health condition that can include an inability to sweat, abnormal teeth and gum development, and an inability for female cats to lactate after giving birth. Similar dominant mutations can also cause the condition in hairless dogs.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Donskoy is a muscular, medium-sized cat with a triangular head, large ears, and large eyes that give it an elf-like appearance. Its most striking characteristic, of course, is its lack of hair, although it is common to have a bit of peach fuzz on the ears and nose. Many Donskoy cats lack whiskers, as well. The skin of a Donskoy is quite wrinkled, especially on its face, neck, chest, and the base of its tail. Petting a Donskoy is often likened to stroking warm chamois cloth.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because Donskoys have a higher body temperature than most cats, this breed actually tends to eat more to maintain their body temperature during the winter. However, their intake should return to normal once winter is over. As with all pet cats, your Donskoy should eat a diet that is high in protein, moderate in fats, and low in carbohydrates. Whether that diet is purely kibble, all canned food, or a mixture of both is up to you, but your cat should have fresh water available at all times.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Donskoy Cat</h2><p>Because this is a rare breed of feline, you are unlikely to find one in a shelter or rescue. If you are determined to own a Donskoy, your best bet is to search for breeders online or visit cat shows where these cats compete.</p><h2>Types of Donskoy Cats</h2><p>Donskoys can have four different types of coats, based on the amount-or lack-of hair.</p><h2>Donskoy Overview</h2><p>The Donskoy is definitely not your average cat: These hairless felines combine an unusual, elf-like appearance with an outgoing, friendly, dog-like personality. These cats are happy to spend time playing and cuddling with their favorite humans, both young and old, and also typically get along well with other cats and cat-friendly dogs. </p><p>Friendly and good with kids</p><p>Intelligent</p><p>Easy to socialize</p><p>Can develop skin issues easily</p><p>Have unique and intensive grooming needs</p>",1215

Instead, the Havana Brown was created in England in the 1950s. So how did this breed come to be named for the lively Cuban city? No one knows for sure, but some theories include that the breed name was inspired by the Havana rabbit or that it was christened Havana Brown in reference to the rich brown color of its coat, reminiscent of the color of Havana tobacco.</p><p>Havana Brown cats are friendly, affectionate, and playful cats of a medium size. Hardly aloof or independent, Havana Brown cats want to be close to their people as much as possible. Some even use their paws like hands to reach out and beg for attention, and they need plenty of it. Havana Brown cats are also quite social with others of their species and happy to cuddle with all family members, whether human or feline. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Outgoing, playful, alert, and intelligent.</p><p>Weight: About 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Length: About 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short to medium length hair</p><p>Coat Color: Rich and even shade of warm brown; color tends toward red-brown (mahogany) rather than black-brown</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid</p><p>Eye Color: Any vivid and level shade of green</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Havana Brown Characteristics</h2><p>While every cat of course has its own personality, as a general rule, Havana Brown cats tend to be very friendly, sociable, and interested in everything happening within their home. They enjoy interactions with their humans, and will happily spend time purring on their owner's lap, engaging in a spirited game of catch the ribbon, or being brushed or stroked. If their favorite human isn't available, Havana Browns are generally more than happy to play with other household pets, both feline and canine. They get along with children, as well.</p><p>Adult Havana Brown cats are a medium size, with a somewhat muscular appearance that is graceful in action. When not investigating, socializing, or playing, they are likely to be engaging in another of their favorite activities: taking a nice, long nap, possibly on their owner's pillow or chair.</p><h2>History of the Havana Brown Cat</h2><p>To learn how the Havana Brown cat came to be, first we must travel back to late 19th century England. During this time, solid-brown cats (called self-brown cats) were being exhibited at British cat shows under various names, one of which was Swiss Mountain Cat. These brown cats looked a lot like Siamese but rather than blue eyes, they had green eyes.</p><p>As the story goes, the Siamese Cat Club of Britain issued an edict in 1920 stating that Siamese may only have blue eyes-not green. As a result, the solid-brown cats slowly disappeared. Fast forward to the 1950s and some English cat breeders decided they would like to recreate that lost brown cat from the past. The group began researching color genetics and performing breeding experiments until they identified how to produce a self-brown cat. </p><p>These breeders found success when a self-brown male kitten, named Praha Gypka, was born via a breeding between a solid black shorthair cat and a chocolate-point Siamese. Around the same time, an accidental breeding took place between a solid black shorthair cat and a seal-point Siamese. That breeding resulted in another brown male kitten, Elmtower Bronze Idol. The first cat to be registered in England as a Havana Brown, Elmtower Bronze Idol today is considered the forerunner of the Havana Brown breed. </p><h2>Havana Brown Care</h2><p>The Havana Brown's short, smooth coat requires minimal grooming. Brush once a week with a soft slicker or rubber curry brush to remove the loose hair. To give the coat a brilliant shine, polish it with chamois cloth after brushing. Keep your Havana Brown cat's nails trimmed short and check inside the ears weekly. If you see any dirt in the ears, use a pet ear cleanser to clean the ears using a cotton ball (never stick anything like a cotton swab into a cat's ear). If the ears look red, inflamed or excessively dirty, or if you see your Havana Brown shaking its head or scratching at its ears, call for an appointment with your veterinarian.</p><p>Havana Browns are naturally active and curious, so it's easy to encourage daily exercise with indoor enrichment and play. Bring out toys a few times daily and engage your Havana Brown in play. The breed is quite frisky, and many love to play fetch with small toys like a dog might. Give your Havana Brown plenty of climbing opportunities, as well, with cat trees, shelving, or kitty condos.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although any cat can develop a health issue during its life, some pedigreed cat breeds are more prone to certain congenital health problems. However, the Havana Brown has no known specific conditions. Even so, it's a good idea to buy a kitten from a breeder who offers a health guarantee of some kind. </p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Havana Brown is a striking cat, thanks to its sleek and shiny coat, which is a warm brown from the tips of its ears to the tip of its tail. Even the whiskers and nose are brown. While Havana Brown kittens and young adults might have very faint tabby stripes showing through their coats, these ""ghost"" markings should fade away by the time the cat reaches mature adulthood. The coat is fairly short, although some individual cats might have a bit longer fur.</p><p>Dazzling green eyes are another hallmark of the breed. Any even color of vivid green is permitted by breed standards, but the deeper the better. Some of these cats have emerald-green eyes that are truly spectacular against their brown coats. The overall shape of the head is somewhat triangular, which is a nod to the breed's Siamese heritage.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Havana Browns like to eat. Take care to ensure your Havana Brown doesn't eat too much and gain too much weight. Keeping your cat lean may help to prevent certain weight-related health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Feed measured amounts of a healthy cat food at regular times (twice a day for adult cats). Free feeding (leaving food out all day) can lead to snacking and contribute to obesity. If you're not sure what to feed your Havana Brown, talk to your veterinarian or breeder for advice.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Havana Brown Cat</h2><p>The Havana Brown is an extremely rare cat breed. If you long for a Havana Brown kitten, it may be difficult to find. Your best bet is attending a local cat show, where you can meet reputable breeders. Cat shows are fun to watch, and you can view many different cat breeds all together. To find a cat show in your area, do an internet search for cat show near me or check The Cat Fancier's Association website, which lists registered cat shows all over the world. </p><h2>Havana Brown Overview</h2><p>Beautiful, playful, intelligent, and sociable, a Havana Brown cat is sure to win your heart. These sleek, warm-brown cats with bright green eyes love to interact with their household, including humans of all ages and fellow pets. As a plus, they don't shed as much as many other cats, although they still benefit from regular grooming, and generally enjoy it as well.</p><p>Friendly and affectionate </p><p>Social with other cats </p><p>Low shedding</p><p>Doesn't do well if left alone</p><p>Needs a lot of attention</p><p>Rare/hard to find</p>",1229

These terriers have instant appeal, thanks to their petite size and lively expressions. Originally bred for hunting foxes, these pint-sized canines excel in everything from agility to dock diving and barn hunts. They make excellent pets-if you can stay one step ahead of these clever little dogs who can be independent thinkers and strong-willed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 13 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 17 pounds</p><p>Coat: Smooth or rough short double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Solid white or white with markings in black, tan, or both (known as tri-color) </p><p>Life Span: 15 to 18 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, energetic, bold, playful, lively</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Parson Russell Terrier</h2><p>If you're a big personality looking for a pet that can say the same, the Parson Russell terrier might be for you. Small in stature but big on energy, they'll bring a lively enthusiasm to any activity you involve them in, from tug of war to a day in the dog park.</p><h2>History of the Parson Russell Terrier</h2><p>The history of the Parson Russell terrier traces back to England in the 1800s. Parson John Russell, a minister and avid English sportsman, desired a smaller foxhound that could keep up with foxes on the hunt and easily ""go to ground"" to pursue the swift creatures into their underground burrows and flush them out.</p><p>Starting with a small terrier of uncertain pedigree named Trump, Russell began a selective breeding program that would eventually produce a kennel of petite terriers with a distinct look and tenacious personality on the hunt. The dogs were of sufficient stature to run with larger English foxhounds across the English countryside but had a flexible frame and slight enough build to squeeze into foxholes and bay the fox from its hiding place.</p><p>Russell died in 1883, but the legacy of his small but mighty hunters would live on. In fact, the term Jack Russell terrier began to be used to describe a wide range of small working terriers and hounds. This speaks to the impact that Russell made on the world of hunting dogs in England and beyond, but also brought its own challenges.</p><p>A growing number of breed enthusiasts felt that the term Jack Russell terrier was being applied too liberally to an increasingly diverse pool of terriers, many of which had shorter legs and a longer back than the standard to which Russell developed his breed. In 1904, Arthur Heinemann is credited with the first breed standard for the Jack Russell terrier. A decade later, he would found the Parson Jack Russell Terrier Club in England which aimed to keep the breed true to the type and vision that Parson John Russell worked so hard to develop.</p><p>However, a great number of dogs with a diversity of characteristics were exported to other countries, including the United States under the term Jack Russell terrier. This has sparked decades of debate between purists of the breed standard and those who place an emphasis on the breed's working ability.</p><p>In 1985, the Jack Russell Terrier Association of America was founded. The club's breed standard reflected Heinmann's breed standard from 1904. Then in 1990, England's Kennel Club recognized the Parson Jack Russell terrier as a variant of the fox terrier and adopted a 14-inch standard for the breed. Moving forward in time, the AKC gave the Jack Russell terrier registration status in 1997 and then added it to the terrier group in 2003.</p><h2>Parson Russell Terrier Care</h2><p>When it comes to caring for a Parson Russell terrier, make no mistake about it-these small dogs involve a big commitment. Equipped with seemingly endless energy and an inquisitive, intelligent nature, this dog breed is always on the go. For this reason, they often make good pets in homes with children, since they'll gladly play for hours. However, it's important to teach kids how to treat the dog with respect. Fortunately, the Parson Russell terrier's grooming needs are fairly routine.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Parson Russell terriers need several solid walks or a run each day. Once they've reached adulthood, this long-legged dog makes a compact jogging partner. Without sufficient exercise and mental stimulation, Parson Russell terriers can be high-strung and may resort to destructive behavior.</p><p>Fortunately, they are well-suited for a number of canine competitions. Aside from plenty of success in the show ring, Parson Russell terriers have enjoyed top honors in canine agility, dock diving, go-to-ground trials, and barn hunts. Such activities are a great way to bond with your dog while also giving this breed an outlet for his intensity and drive.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Though the training and care of this dog breed are anything but low maintenance, the grooming routine is. This dog's short, coarse coat just needs an occasional rub with a grooming mitt to keep it in order. A bath will keep dander in check and odors away, but it's not needed on a routine basis. Trim your dog's nails as needed, brush their teeth regularly, and be sure to keep the ears clean. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Parson Russell terrier is not generally recommended for first time dog owners or families who cannot dedicate the proper time and attention to detailed training. In addition to the breed's abundant energy, the terrier personality often manifests itself in a stubborn or independent streak. Owners of a Parson Russell terrier must exhibit effective leadership from the beginning to avoid this little dog from dominating the house or preferring to pursue his own ideas. The breed is not known for being overly shy or timid, but still benefits from a positive, firm approach.</p><p>Keeping in mind the breed's origin helps shed more light on its personality, although each individual dog is different. Initially bred to work with a pack, the Parson Russell terrier generally is compatible with other dogs. Aggressiveness or a quarrelsome nature were viewed as undesirable traits and were avoided in the early breeding program.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Parson Russell terrier generally enjoys a long life-up to 15 or more years, with few major health concerns. However, to help ensure the heartiness of the breed, responsible breeders screen for hereditary health issues such as eye problems, deafness, and more.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Parson Russell terrier is an active dog breed that will do best on a quality high-protein dog food. Don't let these little dogs become overweight; limit meals to twice a day and keep treats in check. Remember, too, that this agile breed is capable of jumping up to surprising heights, so don't leave your dinner table or any snacks unattended.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Parson Russell Terrier</h2><p>If you're looking for a Parson Russell terrier, you might want to begin your search with rescue groups. The energy and enthusiasm of the breed sometimes results in unprepared owners surrendering these dogs. However, if you know what to expect from a Parson Russell terrier, you might find your new best friend waiting at a rescue.</p><p>There are also a number of breeders of Parson Russell terriers throughout the United States. Both the breed club and the AKC are good resources to identify potential breeders.</p><h2>Parson Russell Terrier Overview</h2><p>Intelligent and quick learners</p><p>Low maintenance coat</p><p>Adaptable to many canine competitions</p><p>Needs strong leadership</p><p>High exercise needs for a small breed</p><p>Not recommended for novice dog owners</p>",1215
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bloodhound-dog-breed-profile-4782183,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hound Dog Breeds,<h1>Bloodhound: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Bloodhound: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The Bloodhound is a large hound dog from France with a hardy build, short fur, wrinkly skin, extra-long ears, and an incredibly powerful nose. This breed may bring the laid-back family dog from to mind, but these immense, powerful dogs are anything but lazy.</p><p>With the strongest sense of smell in the canine world, Bloodhounds are exceptionally skilled trackers-especially when looking for people-and their scenting abilities are so accurate that their findings are even admissible in a court of law. While they're some of the calmest, most even-tempered dogs in the house, Bloodhounds are tenacious when following a trail. With their families, these dogs are affectionate and eager to lounge.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (males); 23 to 25 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 90 to 110 pounds (males); 80 to 100 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Short, dense, and loose fur with many folds around the face, neck, and ears</p><p>Coat Color: Black and tan, liver and tan, or red</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, loving, even-tempered, stubborn, gentle</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bloodhound</h2><p>Because they're true pack dogs, Bloodhounds have a companionable temperament with other dogs and children. They also have high exercise needs and energy levels, so being left alone for extended periods of time can be detrimental. If your family has a busy schedule and you're away from home for most of the day, the Bloodhound likely is not the right dog for you. This breed does best in homes with large, fenced-in backyards (privacy fences are recommended). Apartment or small-space living is not suitable.</p><h2>History of the Bloodhound</h2><p>It's believed that the Bloodhound dates back to the first century AD in France, but the first written reference to the breed appeared in a poem by Sir Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford. The poem describes a dog carefully trailing a couple dressed up as bears.</p><p>Before they were known as Bloodhounds, these dogs were called St. Hubert hounds. Francois Hubert made it his life's work to breed dogs that could follow a cold (or old) trail, and he continued to develop the breed after retiring to a French monastery. Following his death, Hubert was canonized as the patron saint of hunters in France, hence the name St. Hubert hounds.</p><p>The modern Bloodhound breed was developed in England and eventually traveled to colonial America. Their popularity dipped during the Civil War-they had been depicted as vicious animals in the novel -but it had a resurgence in 1888 when English Bloodhounds competed in the Westminster Kennel Club show. After the show, many Americans brought Bloodhounds home and further populated the breed in North America.</p><h2>Bloodhound Care</h2><p>The Bloodhound's good nature and heartwarming, entertaining personality has made it a cherished breed among hound enthusiasts. However, these high-maintenance dogs don't become their best without plenty of time and effort from their owners. If you think the Bloodhound is right for you, it's best to research and prepare for the proper care that these dogs require.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bloodhounds are energetic dogs that require at least two hours per day of substantial exercise. Activities like running and hiking are great ways for owners to exercise with this breed. Bloodhounds are capable of walking or jogging for miles, but they're also content to play in the backyard.</p><p>These hounds have a tendency to follow their noses and drift away during walks or playtime, so keeping them on a leash or contained in a fenced-in yard is vital. Since the breed is known for being the best scenter of all, your Bloodhound is also the perfect candidate to play nose work games with you. Hide-and-seek, either to find treats or family members, is an especially fun activity that owners can do with these dogs.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because of the long, deep wrinkles around their faces, necks, and ears, Bloodhounds require consistent grooming and cleaning. Owners should expect to clean wrinkles daily. Wiping them with a damp washcloth and drying them thoroughly can help prevent bacterial infections from forming. Be sure to clean the folds around the mouth after every meal.</p><p>Bloodhounds have short, dense coats that should be brushed weekly using a rubber mitt or brush. They shed seasonally and may require additional brushing during this time. Since they have such thin, loose skin, it's important for owners to be careful and gentle when grooming. Like all breeds, you should also brush your Bloodhound's teeth regularly and trim his or her nails as needed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Bloodhounds can be stubborn, which may make training difficult. Obedience classes are recommended beginning in puppyhood at about eight weeks of age. The keys to training your dog are consistency and patience; be sure to utilize positive reinforcement with special toys and treats. Methods of punishment are not recommended for this breed, as it can be detrimental to their sensitive nature and lead to fear or anxiety when interacting with you.</p><p>Prospective owners should know that Bloodhounds of all ages are chewers, so it's important to establish which items in the house are designated for this in puppyhood. Like other hounds, this breed is also likely to be vocal. Rather than barking, it's known for its loud bay. This is another reason that the Bloodhound is recommended for homes with plenty of outdoor space (and preferably not too close to any neighbors).</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Bloodhounds are generally healthy dogs, but like most purebreds, they may be susceptible to certain inherited health problems. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards by performing medical tests on prospective parents before breeding.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Depending on your dog's age, size, and activity level, you can expect to feed him or her between 4 and 8 cups of high-quality dog food divided into two meals daily. Like other large breeds, some owners of Bloodhounds opt to use slow-feeder bowls or feed their dogs several smaller meals each to help prevent Bloat.</p><p>Monitor your dog's weight to prevent canine obesity, which can lead to other serious health conditions like diabetes and heart disease. If you've noticed your dog gaining weight, limit treats and consult your veterinarian about healthy options. Your vet can also help you determine the proper portions and nutrients that your dog needs at different stages of life.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bloodhound</h2><p>Bloodhounds aren't for every family. If you're away from the home often or live in a smaller space, a Bloodhound may not be the right pick for you. Unfortunately, many Bloodhounds are purchased from breeders without a clear understanding of the care and time required to raise this breed. For this reason, they can be surrendered to shelters or rescue groups. Contact your local animal shelter or breed-specific rescues to adopt a Bloodhound in need of a forever home.</p><p>If you plan to purchase a Bloodhound as a puppy, be sure to do your research and ensure you're working with an ethical breeder. Be on the lookout for common signs of backyard breeding, like unsanitary conditions at the breeding site, multiple litters available at the same time, or unhealthy dogs.

This breed is defined by contrasts: Small but sturdy, lively but laid-back, and driven but docile, Cesky terriers are well-rounded hunters that also make lovable family dogs. As you might expect, such a breed is hard to find, and the Cesky is one of the rarest dog breeds in the world.</p><p>Also known as the Bohemian terrier, the Cesky is the national dog of the Czech Republic. Cesky is pronounced like chess-kee (literally meaning Czech), which is fitting since the breed's beginnings were a product of one Czech man's vision and determination. Cesky terriers are longer than they are tall and sport a long, silky coat in varying shades of gray. A distinctive plume of fur cascades from the forehead and over the eyes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 24 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long, silky fur</p><p>Coat Color: Varying shades of gray from black to platinum</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, calm, quiet, playful, intelligent</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Czech Republic</p><h2>Characteristics of the Cesky Terrier</h2><p>The Cesky makes a great companion, happy to go on an adventure or curl up at home. These dogs are a great choice for apartment dwellers, but they also enjoy a backyard and regular playtime outdoors. This breed also does well with children and other dogs when introduced properly (though they may be likely to chase cats). Keep in mind that as terriers, they have an intelligent personality that needs to be channeled properly or mischief may ensue. In comparison to many other strong-willed terriers, you'll find the Cesky to be more obedient and submissive, making them a well-rounded pet with a friendly temperament.</p><h2>History of the Cesky Terrier</h2><p>It might seem like a far-fetched idea to design your ideal dog, but Frantisek Horak, a hunter from the city of Prague, had a vision in mind for a new dog breed. In the mid-1900s, Horak decided to embark on a breeding program to produce a terrier that would be an adaptable hunter, but also an easygoing and trainable companion dog.</p><p>Some terriers, while tenacious hunters, tend to be headstrong and dominant. The goal for the Cesky was to breed a small terrier that could still hunt independently or with a pack while being more easygoing and obedient than others.</p><p>To achieve his vision, Horak started selectively breeding Scottish terriers and Sealyham terriers that had the ideal traits for this new breed. While it isn't well-documented, some speculation exists that the Dandie Dinmont terrier and wirehaired dachshund were also contributors to the Cesky gene pool. This isn't a stretch to believe, since Dandie Dinmonts are known for their docile temperament-a top concern for Horak-while dachshunds have a long, low body type with the ability to hunt game large and small.</p><p>About two decades elapsed before the Cesky terrier was first imported to the United States in the 1980s. It would take several more decades before the breed achieved AKC recognition, which occurred in 2011. Today, this Bohemian terrier is on the AKC's list of the rarest dog breeds, making it all the more special to find one.</p><h2>Cesky Terrier Care</h2><p>Since the Cesky was bred specifically to have a docile, intelligent personality along with its hunting skills, these dogs are very trainable. They enjoy pleasing their families, and they're happy to come along for exercising together. When it comes to their long coats, Cesky terriers need a bit more time and effort from their owners.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As a small but active dog breed, you can expect the Cesky to be ready for long walks each day (and he can even join you for a jog). If you enjoy hiking or backpacking, this terrier will be right there with you-just be aware that his short stature means he might have some limitations when it comes to scrambling up rocks or negotiating river crossings. About one hour of activity per day in the form of walks, running in the yard, or playing games is sufficient to keep your Cesky happy.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Fittingly, the Bohemian terrier has a free-flowing and silky coat. It will require regular bathing since the fine texture of the hair tends to hold dirt. Additionally, a good brushing every few days will keep tangles at bay and decrease shedding. Plan to have this dog professionally groomed every six to eight weeks (depending on coat length) by trimming it with clippers rather than hand-stripping.</p><p>Like all breeds, your Cesky will also need to have its nails trimmed and ears checked as needed. If you notice a buildup of dirt in your dog's ears, clean them gently with a cotton ball and ear cleaner. Small dogs can also be more prone to dental problems, so it's important for owners to keep up with brushing their teeth.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Cesky's willingness to please makes this breed particularly easy to train. They typically grasp the basics of house training and obedience relatively quickly, and basic lessons can begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. Be on the lookout, though, for subtle stubbornness. As a terrier, the Cesky is still prone to an independent attitude if you're not active with training and maintain a good pack order. Their intelligence level means that they also love to learn new tricks, and this is a great opportunity to exercise their mind while strengthening your bond.</p><p>These dogs are known to be affectionate and loyal with family members, but more reserved with strangers. They're not particularly standoffish or even aggressive-just wary until they feel comfortable with the newcomer. A big bark in comparison to the Cesky's small size also serves as a good warning of intruders.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Springing from the careful breeding of pedigreed dogs, the Cesky is known as a healthy breed with few common health problems. Breeders that are committed to helping the Cesky continue to thrive and grow in popularity are key to continuing the longevity and healthy nature of this breed. However, like most purebred dogs, it is still susceptible to a few inherited issues.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Cesky terrier a balanced diet without overfeeding at mealtimes or with treats. These dogs can be very food-oriented, so it's important to keep them on a routine and not allow them to overeat. Too much weight gain can cause canine obesity and lead to other health problems.</p><p>The breed isn't known for suffering from many food allergies, so they generally do well on any high-quality food formula. To determine the best diet plan for your specific dog, talk to your veterinarian about portions and nutrients based on age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cesky Terrier</h2><p>Adopting a Cesky terrier typically costs between $1,200 and $2,600, but prices can vary depending on pedigree and availability. Advocates for the breed are very much interested in seeing these dogs become more widely known family pets, so they're generally happy to be of assistance in any way possible. To learn more about the adoption process, contact breed clubs and responsible breeders who are enthusiastic about these unique dogs.</p><h2>Cesky Terrier Overview</h2><p>Easy to train, docile demeanor</p><p>Gets along well with children</p><p>Less high-strung than other terriers</p><p>Can be dominant or aggressive toward smaller animals</p><p>Needs consistent grooming</p><p>Can be stranger-shy without proper socialization</p>",1221

Part of the terrier family, this breed has tenacity but is teeming with affection and antics. Their demeanor and appearance are largely similar to the standard bull terrier-but make no mistake about it, the MBT is a breed all its own with a devoted &lsquo;egghead' following.</p><p>Today, the mini bull terrier makes a popular pet and excels as a canine competitor, particularly in agility. However, these dogs require firm, patient training and aren't necessarily the best choice for a first-time dog owner. If you've got what it takes to stay one step ahead of the MBT, you'll fall in love with this breed's unique character.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 35 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, coarse coat</p><p>Coat Color: Various colors including white, red, fawn, brindle, or black (solid or mixed with white)</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Playful, stubborn, athletic, affectionate, independent, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Miniature Bull Terrier</h2><p>Your mini bull terrier will be the happiest when spending time with you. This breed is known for having a playful, affectionate temperament-but adopt with caution, as they're also very intelligent and become bored easily. MBTs need excessive amounts of training and exercise to stay happy, but even with the proper care, they're still likely to flaunt their stubborn temperament at times. This breed needs to be socialized consistently from a young age to prevent guarding behaviors toward strangers, and they aren't ideal for homes with other pets. However, that doesn't mean they aren't still excellent companions. For an experienced, mindful owner, the miniature bull terrier is an endless source of entertainment and love thanks to its goofy personality and extra-loyal nature.</p><h2>History of the Miniature Bull Terrier</h2><p>With one look at the miniature bull terrier, you'll see that this dog is a breed all its own. The characteristic egg-shaped head and triangular eyes give few insights into the breed's history. However, like all miniature breeds, we know that the MBT was bred down into a smaller package from the standard bull terrier.</p><p>The standard bull terrier is commonly thought to have been developed in the mid-1800s from a cross between the old English bulldog, the English white terrier, the English greyhound, and the Dalmatian. From this canine conglomeration emerged a terrier that excelled at hunting and killing rats in sporting events where spectators placed bets on the outcomes.</p><p>Seeing the breed's tenacity, hunters started breeding a miniature version to serve as smaller ""ratters"" that could hunt small prey even in tight quarters. The miniature bull terrier today holds onto the tenacity of the terrier, and the breed often exhibits a strong prey drive. However, the playful and sweet nature of the mini is what makes this breed an outstanding companion pet.</p><h2>Miniature Bull Terrier Care</h2><p>Like many terriers, the mini bull terrier has a big heart inside its deep chest. These dogs tend to show tremendous loyalty to their owners and family. While not overly clingy, they do love to be around their people and can become bored or destructive if left alone for excessively long periods of time. They reportedly do well with children, but it's important to make sure that your dog is socialized from puppyhood with kids of various ages. The energy and enthusiasm of an MBT make a great playmate for older kids that love to run and romp.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Keep in mind that these dogs are very smart. Without enough mental and physical exercise, they'll find their own way to stay occupied. Frequently described by breed enthusiasts as ""a 3-year-old in a dog suit,"" they'll keep you entertained but also spring plenty of surprises on you.</p><p>A few solid walks each day will help keep your bull terrier in shape and out of trouble. These dogs also tend to enjoy athletic challenges like agility, flyball, rally, and more. Introducing a number of activities into your MBT's routine is a great way to prevent boredom while keeping your dog fit and healthy.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming a mini bull terrier is fairly simple. These dogs only need brushing once a week or so, ideally with a grooming mitt. They benefit from an occasional bath to keep doggy odor away, but it's not necessary to go to any great lengths to keep your MBT's coat looking great. You should know that this breed is at least an average shedder; some dogs shed less while others shed more, but either way, the short, coarse hairs are bound to show up on your floors, furniture, and clothing. Consistent brushing is the best way to keep excess hair at bay. It's also important to brush your dog's teeth and trim their nails on a regular basis.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training a mini bull terrier will likely be your greatest delight and hardest challenge. Owners of an MBT simultaneously sing their praises while lamenting their stubborn streak. This is typical for terriers, and the mini bull terrier has a full-sized dose of attitude.</p><p>Some say that bull terriers are particularly dog-aggressive, but other experienced owners point out that good socialization is the key (as it is with any dog breed). Still, it's wise to keep in mind that this breed was developed to hunt small game, so their prey drive is strong and might overrule good training on occasion. Some owners note that their mini bull terrier can't be trusted off-leash, while others find it possible-as long as they let their pooch choose his own path.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>With a sturdy build and ready-to-go personality, the mini bull terrier isn't frail or feeble. However, the breed still has some medical problems to be aware of. The National Breed Club recommends asking your MBT breeder for health tests from both parents (and the puppy, if applicable) for common conditions. Look for a responsible breeder with solid pedigrees and a healthy lineage to help minimize the chances of issues related to inbreeding.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Mini bull terriers should be fed a quality diet with plenty of protein, along with special caution against overfeeding. These dogs are prone to canine obesity, so don't make it a habit to give too many treats or feed table scraps to this breed. Feed adult mini bull terriers twice per day and consult your veterinarian about the proper amount per meal for your specific dog.</p><p>This breed's tendency towards allergies sometimes means that they struggle with traditional dog food formulas. Some MBTs do better on a limited-ingredient diet to combat allergies and maintain a healthy coat and skin.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Miniature Bull Terrier</h2><p>Breeders exist that specialize in the mini bull terrier, but you might also find your pint-sized pal at a rescue. While the mini bull terrier has been gaining notoriety, thanks in part to the breed's role in major marketing campaigns, they're still a relatively rare terrier to find. Puppies from breeders typically cost between $1,500 and $3,000, though some breeders may charge more depending on availability and pedigree.</p><p>Local or regional bully breed rescues sometimes have mini bull terriers in need of a good home. It's always a great idea to check with your local rescues first before buying a puppy from a breeder.</p><h2>Breed Overview</h2><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Highly intelligent</p><p>Compact size</p><p>Can be stubborn</p><p>May not tolerate other dogs well</p><p>Needs extensive exercise</p>",1222

In fact, the first known LaPerm litter was born in 1982 in the United States. Perhaps best known for its distinctive appearance, the LaPerm has gently wavy to tightly curled hair, which can be short or long. Because the LaPerm is the result of a natural genetic mutation, LaPerms can come in every color and coat pattern.</p><p>LaPerms tend to be extremely affectionate with their close family members and thrive in a household with or without children or other pets. Because the LaPerm originated from barn cats, they're very active cats with higher exercise and play needs-and they especially love a good game of chase. Despite their higher activity levels, LaPerms are happy to cuddle up on the couch after a good play session, and they do more purring than vocalizing.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Dalles LaPerm</p><p>Personality: Active, friendly, curious, affectionate, and playful</p><p>Weight: Between 6 and 10 pounds</p><p>Length: Between 12 and 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Can have short hair or long hair</p><p>Coat Color: Any genetically possible color of coat</p><p>Coat Patterns: Any genetically possible coat pattern, including solid, tabby, calico, or tortoiseshell</p><p>Eye Color: A wide variety of colors, including copper, gold, yellow, aqua, blue, or green</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>LaPerm Characteristics</h2><p>The LaPerm is a medium-sized cat that takes two to three years to reach full maturity. It's known best for its coat, which is generally wavy in short-haired LaPerms and curly in longer haired cats. Either way, the LaPerm has a very outgoing personality. This is a cat that loves to interact and play with its humans, both children and adult, before settling down for a good purr and a cuddle on the nearest lap. It generally gets along with other family pets, as well.</p><h2>History of the LaPerm</h2><p>Although the LaPerm has a relatively short history, the origin story is fascinating. In 1982, in a cherry orchard in The Dalles, Oregon, owners of a brown tabby barn cat named Speedy noticed an interesting trait in one of its six kittens: It was completely bald, unlike its soft, brown siblings. Plus, it was small in size, but had a long body.</p><p>After about eight weeks, the kitten started to grow soft, wavy hair all over its body. Not surprisingly, it was named Curly. After Curly had matured-and the owners got to know its sweet, docile personality-it had a litter of five tabby kittens. Those kittens, too, were born completely bald, but developed soft, curly coats a few months after birth.</p><p>Over the next decade, the owners, Linda and Richard Koehl, didn't control Curly's breeding or track any of the litters produced-so the number of curly haired kittens increased rapidly.</p><p>In 1992, Linda entered six of her curly haired cats into a Cat Fanciers' Association show in Portland, Oregon. The show required a breed name for registration, so Linda registered LaPerm-because the cats' coats look like they have a permanent wave. After the show, Linda started a monitored breeding program to better track the development of LaPerm cats and to gain recognition from the world's largest cat associations.</p><p>Today, the LaPerm cat is recognized by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Cat Fanciers' Association, and the International Cat Association.</p><h2>LaPerm Care</h2><p>Thanks to their minimal undercoat and curly hair that tends to stick to the body rather than drop to the floor, LaPerms don't shed very much, although they are not truly hypoallergenic cats. You can reduce shedding further by brushing your feline regularly. On the off-chance it does develop a mat or tangle-which is unusual even in the long-haired LaPerms-gently comb it out with a slicker brush or comb.</p><p>If your LaPerm's curls need a boost, mist its coat with water from a spray bottle and gently scrunch the curls with your hands to add wave and encourage more curls.</p><p>In any cat, dental hygiene is extremely important and can help prevent the development of periodontal disease. Daily brushing is always ideal, but if you can brush your LaPerm's teeth once a week, it can offer some protection.</p><p>Be sure to check your LaPerm's ears regularly, using a soft, cotton cloth to gently remove dirt or debris. If your cat's ears are excessively dirty, red, inflamed, or smell off, get them checked out by your veterinarian immediately. These can be signs of injury or infection.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The LaPerm is generally a healthy cat, with no tendencies towards any particular health conditions or illnesses. However, any cat can potentially develop health problems during its lifetime, and the LaPerm is no exception.</p><p>If you're concerned about your LaPerm's health, talk to your veterinarian about ways to help your cat live a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>In terms of size and shape, the LaPerm is a medium-sized cat with a somewhat athletic build and long legs relative to their size. But it's the coat that makes this breed special; these cats have wavy to curly hair.</p><p>Surprisingly, it is not uncommon for a LaPerm kitten to be born without any fur at all, however. Others have short hair at birth, but lose their coats within their first few weeks, starting at the top of the head. Over the next several months, the kitten grows its coat back in, and even a bald-at-birth LaPerm will generally sport a curly coat by the time it is several months old.</p><p>The fur of a LaPerm is generally curliest along the cat's belly, at the throat, and at the base of its ears. Short-haired LaPerms usually have more wave, while long-haired LaPerms can boast tighter ringlets and curls. Long-haired LaPerms also generally have a large, curly neck ruff and a very fluffy, plumed tail.</p><p>Both long-haired and short-haired LaPerms generally have coats that stand slightly away from their bodies, giving the cat a fluffy, airy appearance. Their hair is soft and springy and doesn't tend to shed excessively. But these are not considered truly hypoallergenic cats.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all cats your LaPerm requires a diet that's high in protein, low in carbohydrates, and moderate in fat. Feeding your feline a high-quality cat food that's formulated for its age is the best way to keep your cat healthy. Be wary of overfeeding, however. Some cats regulate their food intake to maintain a healthy weight, but others feast until the bowl is empty, and can become overweight, which is bad for their health.</p><p>Most adult cats do well with two meals per day. Kittens need to eat more often, but in smaller amounts per meal. Your cat can enjoy a diet of all canned food, all kibble, or a mixture of both.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a LaPerm</h2><p>As LaPerms are not very common, you are unlikely to find one at a rescue or shelter. In fact, there might not be any LaPerm breeders in your area at all. But you might have success finding a breeder at a cat show, especially in a larger city. Another option is checking the breeder listings on the major cat association websites, such as The International Cat Association.</p><h2>LaPerm Overview</h2><p>The LaPerm is a very active, curious, and friendly cat that can be a wonderful pet for a family with children, a single adult, or anyone looking for a feline that loves interaction and cuddles, but also enjoys active play. Its curly coat is definitely an attention getter, but these cats also offer a great deal of companionship and affection to their humans.</p><p>Generally healthy breed</p><p>Low-maintenance coat</p><p>Active and affectionate</p><p>High activity needs</p><p>Can get bored if left alone for long stretches</p>",1252

English springer spaniels are often a popular choice for families with children or other dogs. They're very affectionate and are often referred to as ""Velcro dogs"" because they always want to be close to their human companions.</p><h2>History of the English Springer Spaniel</h2><p>Dogs similar to the English springer spaniel (ESS) are seen in artwork as far back as the 16th century, but it wasn't until the early 19th century that their specific history can be identified.</p><p>Cocker spaniels, and Welsh and English springer spaniels, are all closely related, and in the early days of their history in Britain, they would be born from the same litter and then separated by size and color.</p><p>Originally the cocker spaniels were used for hunting woodcock. The larger springers would be used to jump up, or ""spring,"" to flush the gamebirds up into the air for the hunters to then catch with nets and, later, guns.</p><p>The first definitive strain of pure English springer spaniels can be traced back to 1812. A wealthy family, called the Bougheys of Shropshire, bred from a spaniel called Mop I, and they continued to be passionate about the breed well into the 1900s.</p><p>The English springer spaniel gained recognition from the Kennel Club in the U.K. in 1902, and in 1913 the first ESS were imported to North America.</p><p>In 1927 the English Springer Spaniel Field Trial Association (ESSFTA) was established as the parent club for the breed and, from there, their popularity grew quickly.</p><p>There are two types of English springer spaniel, although they aren't recognized as separate breeds. The Bench or Show ESS focuses on conformation, and they tend to be slightly larger with a heavier coat and a calmer personality. The working, field-type ESS is smaller, faster, and more athletic, and tends to be busier than their larger relatives.</p><p>In 2018, the English springer spaniel was ranked as the 27th most popular breed by the American Kennel Club. Their fun-loving and affectionate personalities have won the hearts of many dog lovers, including Oprah Winfrey, Grace Kelly, and former President George W. Bush.</p><p>Because of their intelligence, sensitive nose, and desire to work, they're also often used as scent work dogs for the police and for search and rescue missions.</p><h2>English Springer Spaniel Care</h2><p>If you lead a quiet and sedentary lifestyle, then the English springer spaniel wouldn't be the best choice of canine companion. If you're looking for a clever dog that loves to be in the company of humans and other dogs and has bundles of energy to join you on long hikes and adventures, then the English springer spaniel could be a perfect match. They are best suited to a household where someone will be around most of the day, though, as they can be prone to separation anxiety.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>A quick leash walk around the block before you head to work isn't enough for this dog, and it could lead to behavioral problems as a result of boredom. An English springer spaniel needs a minimum of 60 minutes a day of spirited exercise.</p><p>If you enjoy hiking, running, or cycling, then your ESS will be thrilled to accompany you. They're enthusiastic canicross competitors and often excel in agility, flyball, scent work trials, and other competitive dog sports.</p><p>Your spaniel will also appreciate swimming as a form of exercise. It's considered a water-loving dog with a water-repelling coat and webbed feet just made for doggy paddling. But if you're out for a walk, avoid puddles because your ESS will head right towards them for some splash time.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>An English springer spaniel won't have extremely intensive grooming requirements. The Bench or Show types may require extra brushing as their coat tends to be heavier.</p><p>They're moderate shedders, and a good weekly brush will help to keep loose hairs at bay and the coat in healthy condition. They can get mats around their ears and on their feathering more easily, and you should always pay extra attention to these areas when brushing. These dogs can get by with a bath once every two or three months unless they've been playing in muddy puddles.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>English springer spaniels are smart and pick up on commands quickly. They love to be busy, have a job to do, and are extremely eager to please. This means they respond very well to reward-based training methods.</p><p>Clear direction and patience may be needed sometimes, as their enthusiasm can mean they try to take things a little fast and get overexcited. You may have to work on mastering things like jumping up, excitement barking, leash manners (especially around other dogs), and even toilet training, as they can be prone to piddling if they are in a frenzy.</p><p>Their hunting background means they may want to chase small furries and care would need to be taken if you have small pets in the same household. You'll likely have to work on getting a rock-solid recall, too.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>English springer spaniels are generally considered a healthy and robust breed. Like all breeds, though, they can be prone to certain genetic health conditions.</p><p>You can minimize the chances of your puppy developing these conditions by securing them from a reputable breeder that performs appropriate health checks on prospective parents.</p><p>Hip Dysplasia: This is common in many breeds. A good breeder will perform hip score testing on parents. It involves the abnormal formation of one or both hip joints, and this degenerative condition can lead to mobility issues and pain. Depending on the severity of the case, surgery may be required to improve your dog's quality of life.</p><p>Eye Problems: The ESS can be prone to developing certain eye conditions, including Retinal Dysplasia, Entropion, and the more serious, Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA).</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, you should feed your English springer spaniel a high-quality and properly portion-controlled diet. With particularly active dogs, you may find they need a diet specifically formulated for working or high-energy breeds. This will ensure they're getting enough nutrients and proteins to help them retain a healthy body weight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an English Springer Spaniel</h2><p>If you plan to get an English springer spaniel puppy, the importance of finding a reputable breeder can't be overstated. This will help to ensure that you have a healthy puppy that has received vital early socialization. Expect to pay a quality breeder between $1,200 and $1,500 for a puppy.</p><h2>English Springer Spaniel Overview</h2><p>Smart and eager to please</p><p>Affectionate with people and other dogs</p><p>Athletic</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise and stimulation</p><p>Can be over-excitable and prone to separation anxiety</p><p>Can have a high prey drive</p>",1246

They look similar to Golden Retrievers-though smaller in size-and bring with them a personality that's all their own. As for whether that personality brings joy to your life or stress, it all depends on what you're looking for in a family dog and what lifestyle you can offer these feisty furballs.</p><p>Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers (often shortened simply to Tollers) are sport dogs at heart with intelligence, affection, and an affinity for self-assured independence. Give a Toller what he or she needs, including plenty of exercise and attention, and you'll have a loyal, affectionate companion-plus a go-to partner for hikes, bike rides, and all the long walks you can take. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 18 to 21 inches (males); 17 to 20 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium-length double coat with a soft undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Red, red-gold, or buff, often with patches of white</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, energetic, affectionate, alert, outgoing</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Canada</p><h2>Characteristics of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever</h2><p>The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is a great breed choice for owners that want their dog to be their best friend. These active dogs are always up for playtime, exercising, and joining their families on adventures. Tollers have especially friendly personalities toward children, and they enjoy living in multi-dog households where play is encouraged. This breed also does well with cats when introductions are made properly, though because of its origins in hunting, it still retains a prey drive and may be inclined to chase smaller animals.</p><h2>History of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever</h2><p>The Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever breed comes from Yarmouth County in Nova Scotia, a Canadian coastal province located slightly northwest of Maine. Originally bred in the 1800s by hunters, Tollers have long been lauded for their ingenuity when it comes to hunting. Much like a fox, the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever employs quick movements that attract the attention of prey and lure them out into the open. Because they're retrievers, Tollers are also valuable to hunters for their willingness to enter the water and bring in downed waterfowl.</p><p>Tollers remained a secret of Nova Scotia hunters for years, though they were eventually recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club in 1945. This occasion was marked by the official renaming of the breed from Little River Duck Dogs to their current long-winded moniker. In the 1960s, Tollers made their way down to the United States, though they weren't officially recognized by the AKC until the mid-1980s. There is much to be praised about modern Tollers: While they continue to look and act like foxes, they've adapted well to life off the hunting grounds (though many are still active in the sport). Today, Tollers are happy to live the life of a family dog, provided they still have an outlet for their famous retriever energy and drive. </p><h2>Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Care</h2><p>Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are active dogs that do best in homes with owners that can fulfill their exercise needs. They're a bit more stubborn than other popular retrievers, but with consistency in training, their eagerness to please can help them learn desired behaviors at home. Grooming a Toller requires little more than regular brushings and routine care, but owners should prepare for a high level of shedding from these long-haired dogs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like most dogs, the Toller requires daily exercise to be at its best. At least an hour per day of activity will keep this breed happy and healthy. One or two long walks or a fenced backyard are key, though Tollers also enjoy participating in sports like agility training and flyball. Adding in plenty of playtime is a great way to strengthen your bond while entertaining your dog. Ultimately, a specific Toller's exercise needs depend on his or her individual preferences. Some Tollers are content to relax on the couch for most of the day after a long walk, while others require much more stimulation and activity to be fulfilled.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming a Nova Scotia Duck Toller is similar to caring for other retrievers. This breed sheds twice per year, so owners should expect to increase its brushing schedule during these seasons to control stray fur around the house. Throughout the rest of the year, brushing these dogs a few times each week should usually keep shedding under control. Bathe your Toller when his or her coat becomes dirty or after long exercise sessions outdoors.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever can be a challenge. While they are certainly eager to please their humans, Tollers have a stubborn and independent streak that can stand in the way of effective training-though it is certainly possible. Begin basic obedience lessons early when puppies are about eight weeks old. Experts recommend short training sessions combined with plenty of consistent, positive reinforcement. Since some Tollers are prone to a bit of mischief, this breed requires obedience training even if it doesn't move on to advanced lessons for activities like agility or hunting.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retrievers are regarded as generally healthy dogs, like most purebreds, they're still prone to a few inherited problems. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards by testing their dogs before breeding, which helps them avoid passing problems down to puppies. Always ask your breeder to provide clear results of any relevant genetic tests for the litter's parents.</p><p>Some of these illnesses, such as Addison's Disease and deafness, don't tend to appear in Nova Scotia Duck Tollers until middle age. It's possible for a Toller with these genetic defects to be bred before the diseases are detected, and unfortunately, gene marker tests for the breed are not yet available. Having access to the litter's genetic history for more than one generation can help breeders mitigate these risks.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Nova Scotia Duck Toller a diet of high-quality dog food twice per day. Foods with a healthy protein listed as the first ingredient are best for these active dogs, while Tollers that exercise extensively each day may need calorie-dense options in higher quantities. Feel free to give your Toller plenty of healthy treats (remember: they respond well to positive reinforcement!), but monitor your dog's weight closely and reduce treats if they begin gaining too much.</p><p>Accommodate any specific dietary needs like food allergies or age-specific nutrients. It's always best to talk to your veterinarian about which types of food and portion sizes are healthy for your dog based on their age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever</h2><p>Since the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever is still a somewhat rare dog breed, prospective adopters may not find many of these dogs in local shelters. However, breed-specific rescues exist to help these cheerful pups find their forever homes. Your local shelter may also introduce you to similar retriever breeds that are waiting to be your next best friend.</p><h2>Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever Overview</h2><p>Cheerful and enthusiastic personality</p><p>Great with children, dogs, and cats when introduced properly</p><p>Loves engaging in sports and activities</p><p>Not ideal for apartment living</p><p>Sheds heavily</p><p>Needs lots of exercise each day to be well-behaved at home</p>",1240

There are a handful of dogs, like the Scotch bearded collie and French briard, that could play a role in the sheepdog's ancestry, but a definitive bloodline hasn't been decided.</p><p>The Old English sheepdog is a fairly modern breed that first emerged in England in the 1800s. Farmers used them as drover dogs, driving livestock to market as well as pulling carts and wagons. Drover dogs are known for their stamina, steadiness, and courage.</p><p>Owners often docked their tails to prove that they were working dogs, which gave Old English sheepdogs the nickname bob or bobtail. Old English sheepdogs are born with a tail, but breeders often dock them when they are a few days old.<br />The American Kennel Club recognized this breed as a member of the herding group in 1888 and Old English sheepdogs quickly became a successful show dog and beloved pet.</p><h2>Old English Sheepdog Care</h2><p>These dogs typically have great inside manners, so their playfulness is not usually a problem when it's time to wind down indoors.

Prospective Old English sheepdog owners should, however, keep in mind that there's a required commitment to regular grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Exercise requirements vary among Old English sheepdogs. This breed is by no means a couch potato but it is happy to laze around much of the time. Despite that, they do require some regular exercise at least once a day for at least an hour.

Old English sheepdogs love working and herding, so a rousing game of fetch or keep away is one of their favorite activities.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Just looking at the voluminous mop of the Old English sheepdog is enough to make a groomer shudder. In actuality, grooming these dogs is just as difficult as grooming any other long-haired dog. Their coat is high-maintenance and grooming can be time-consuming but is crucial for maintaining a happy and healthy sheepdog.</p><p>Because their hair is long and prone to tangles, daily brushing is encouraged. This will keep your dog's coat healthy and free of knots and matting that can collect dirt and bacteria. Daily brushing will also help you manage their heavy shedding. Regular brushing will also prevent you from eventually having to go to an expensive, professional groomer. If mats do appear, they often must be cut out or shaved. potentially dangerous tasks that are best left to a pro.</p><p>Many owners prefer to take their Old English sheepdogs to a professional groomer experienced with long-haired dogs, as bathing these big pups can seem daunting.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Old English sheepdogs are fairly responsive to behavior training training if they are given positive feedback that uses rewards like treats or love. These dogs get along well with kids and other animals when given proper socialization training during puppyhood.</p><p>This breed is an alert and responsive one, which makes training easier, but it's also a breed of independent thinkers. Old English sheepdogs may eventually come up with a way to behave the way they prefer rather than the way you've trained them. When training the Old English sheepdog, it's imperative to be a firm leader and practice consistency during exercises so independent thinking is less likely.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Good breeders will have their puppies screened for these conditions and be able to certify the health of the dog's parents, so it's important to pay attention to these results when picking out your Old English sheepdog.</p><p>Regular grooming can prevent other health issues, like joint problems and infections, so it's important to keep your sheepdog clean and brushed. Their hair can often block their vision, so keep this area trimmed as needed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Staying conscious of an Old English sheepdog's diet is incredibly important. The dog's shaggy coat can often make it difficult to see weight gain, so keeping them on a consistent and nutritious diet will tremendously help prevent obesity and other adverse health effects related to weight gain.</p><p>Proper feeding can also help prevent problems, particular those which result from eating too quickly. If you notice fast eating is an issue with your pet, look into slow feeder bowls or consider feeding them smaller, more frequent meals to allow for slower digestion.</p><p>Checking out the dog food aisle can be scary-there are so many brands, but which one is best for your pooch?

Descended from cats that were brought over on European shipping vessels, the American Shorthair is one of the most popular pedigreed cat breeds in North America, thanks in no small part to these felines' endearing personalities and ability to adapt to a wide variety of circumstances. These sweet kitties tend to be happy and playful pets, but also have an independent streak that means they're not quite as needy as some other breeds.</p><p>Physically, American Shorthairs are healthy cats with long lifespans (15 years or more). While they're not quite known for their athleticism, American Shorthairs are surprisingly well-muscled and powerful-a trait established from all those years of hunting rodents on shipping boats. The most prominent feature of the breed may be their round face. As for their coats, the American Shorthair has short, thick fur that gets even thicker in the winter. These cats can be just about any color or coat pattern, although tabby is particularly common.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Gentle, affectionate, playful, easygoing, and curious</p><p>Weight: 11 to 15 pounds (males); 6 to 12 pounds (females)</p><p>Length: 12 to 15 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Color: Many colors, including white, silver, black, cream, blue, brown, and red</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby is the most common, although calico, tortoiseshell, bi-color, and solid are also acceptable</p><p>Eye Color: Hazel, gold, blue, copper, or green</p><p>Lifespan: 15 to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>American Shorthair Characteristics</h2><p>These cats are known for their easygoing, amiable personalities. Their round faces give them a sweet look that correctly conveys their temperaments. However, don't think that these are dull cats that laze around all day long; as descendants of hard-working mousers, American Shorthairs are still playful and curious felines that like to explore or bat around a crinkle ball or catnip mouse.</p><p>Often silver with black tabby markings, these are strikingly attractive cats. They get along very well in homes with children, other cats, or cat-friendly dogs, but they don't demand constant attention. Your American Shorthair can entertain itself with toys, spend time gazing out the window, clamber up and down a cat tree, or enjoy a good catnap when not spending time cuddling or interacting with you.</p><h2>History of the American Shorthair</h2><p>European settlers to North America brought a lot with them, including the ancestors of what we now refer to as the American Shorthair. This breed's European forbears snagged a trip to the New World thanks to their affinity for hunting and catching rodents-a quality that was as prized on rat- and mice-laden shipping vessels as it was in the homes and barns of the country's newest residents. It is believed that the ancestors of the American Shorthair came over on the Mayflower, and that they may have made the trip even earlier than that.</p><p>Once in America, these cats began to multiply, over time developing the traits that distinguish them as a unique breed. Due to their prized personalities, American Shorthairs were (and continue to be) selectively bred in an effort to maintain and propagate their many likable qualities. Many of their physical traits can be traced to their early days in the country, including a dense coat that was ideal for withstanding cold winters while working and hunting outdoors, a moderately large size, and a muscular body.</p><p>The name American Shorthair was given to the breed in 1966 to distinguish them from the domestic shorthair, which is randomly bred and does not carry such specific traits. Today, American Shorthairs are the sixth most popular pedigreed cat breed, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association.</p><h2>American Shorthair Care</h2><p>The American Shorthair loves to play and will happily do so-provided they're in the mood. This breed enjoys socializing with their humans, though they have enough of an independent streak to entertain themselves as well, meaning you don't usually have to worry about separation anxiety. Leaving interactive toys around the home will help ensure an American Shorthair gets enough exercise, as will setting aside one-on-one playtime. Since this breed does well with other cats, getting a kitty companion is another way to keep your American Shorthair active.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>American Shorthairs are robust, long-lived felines not genetically prone to any particular health issues. Like any cat, however, they can develop chronic or acute diseases, particularly if allowed to roam freely outdoors, where they are likelier to pick up parasites or come in contact with viruses and bacteria. Free-roaming cats are also likelier to be injured in accidents or ingest toxic substances.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>A full-grown American Shorthair is a fairly large cat, but generally does not reach mature size until the age of three or four years. These beautiful cats have thick, short fur that can be a wide range of colors and patterns, but the overwhelming majority-75 percent, according to the Cat Fanciers' Association-are tabbies, with silver tabbies being especially popular. They can have a variety of eye colors, as well, although green and gold are quite common.</p><p>American Shorthairs are powerful cats who require strict nutritional oversight to ensure they do not get overweight-a trait to which this this breed is prone. While they are disposed to long lifespans and can live for up to 20 years in good health, this is dependent on a high-quality diet that provides enough fuel for their muscular statures without leading to excessive weight gain. If you're concerned about how to properly feed your American Shorthair-or if your American Shorthair is overweight-talk to your veterinarian about proper feeding guidelines.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American Shorthair</h2><p>As a popular and fairly common breed of cat, you should have no problem in adopting or buying an American Shorthair. These lovable felines make a great addition to any home, especially those with children or other pets.</p><p>If you are interested in purchasing a purebred American Shorthair, you can find a list of vetted breeders through The International Cat Association or by searching online for a registered breeder. You can also find American Shorthair breeders by visiting cat shows, where these popular cats are usually on display.</p><h2>American Shorthair Overview</h2><p>Sweet, easygoing, curious, playful, and affectionate: these cats make wonderful family pets, but because they are able to keep themselves entertained, they also do well in homes with a single adult. American Shorthairs are beautiful cats with thick fur in a wide range of colors, but most often, they dazzle in boldly striped coats. They are not hypoallergenic, however, and do shed moderately.</p><p>With their muscular bodies, befitting to a breed developed to hunt rodents throughout cold winters, these are not delicate felines, but they are still happy to spend time curled on their favorite human's lap or enjoy a game of catch the feather on a string.</p><p>Friendly and great household companions</p><p>Get along with other pets</p><p>Independent</p><p>Prone to weight gain</p><p>Require weekly brushing</p><p>Heavier than they look</p>",1147

Athletic, smart, and friendly-sounds like a recipe for popularity, doesn't it? For the German shorthaired pointer, this versatile combination has landed it in the AKC's top 10 most popular dog breeds. A GSP is both a top family dog and a hunter's ultimate companion..</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 23 to 25 inches (males); 21 to 23 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 70 pounds (males); 45 to 60 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Short and thin</p><p>Coat Color: Solid liver, liver and white, liver roan, or liver and ticked</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, companionable, active, bold, attentive</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the German Shorthaired Pointer</h2><p>The German shorthaired pointer is a quick learner that thrives on having a job to do. Considering that these dogs were bred to spend hours with hunters tracking, pointing, and retrieving game, they have a tireless work ethic that needs to be channeled into desired behaviors. When they're at home, GSPs have very affectionate personalities. This breed is a popular choice for families with older children thanks to its loyal temperament and enthusiasm for playing. Younger kids, on the other hand, may become overwhelmed by the dog's energy level.</p><p>Whatever activities you're into, plan to involve your GSP. It's best to adopt this breed if you spend plenty of time outside and have the ability to bring your dog along regularly. They love to be with their family, but they also require extensive exercise. When they receive both, they're known to be happy, sociable dogs. Without enough exercise, the enthusiasm of the GSP quickly turns into destructive energy.</p><h2>History of the German Shorthaired Pointer</h2><p>This dog breed's name is a clear giveaway to its country of origin. The German shorthaired pointer did, in fact, originate in Germany in the 1800s. Sporting enthusiasts set out to develop a gundog that could hunt game and retrieve birds equally well. Also important in the development of this versatile canine was a friendly, trainable personality that would make the dog a capable partner but also an easy companion.</p><p>It's believed that a variety of German breeds and European hunting dogs were bred to optimize the GSP for tracking, pointing, and retrieving purposes. The now non-existent German Bird Dog, the bloodhound, and perhaps English and Spanish pointing dogs were cross-bred to create what was simply known as the shorthair hunting dog. By 1870, a studbook was established for the breed.</p><p>Outside of Bavaria, the breed became known as the German shorthaired pointer. Throughout Europe and in the United States, hunters quickly recognized how capable the GSP was on the hunt for small game or as a duck hunter's dream dog. This breed loves to swim, being equipped with webbed feet and an agile, athletic body for water retrieving.</p><p>The first German shorthaired pointers were brought to the United States in the late 1920s. By the spring of 1930, the GSP had attained AKC recognition. Its popularity continues into modern times, making the AKC's top 10 list for the most popular dog breeds. These dogs are an obvious choice for sportsmen, but they're also popular as active companions.</p><h2>German Shorthaired Pointer Care</h2><p>Because of its short coat, the German shorthaired pointer doesn't require much grooming other than the basics. When it comes to exercise, however, this breed can be high-maintenance for families that don't regularly spend time being active outdoors. Thankfully, these easily trainable dogs quickly learn desired behaviors and make great companions for new activities.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to give your Gerrman shorthaired pointer at least two good exercise sessions each day. An appropriate amount will take more than a quick walk around the block: The more time you can spend mentally and physically challenging these dogs, the happier they'll be.</p><p>If you're a sportsman, your GSP will never give up before you do. Anyone seeking a dog to go jogging, hiking, or on other adventures will find a willing companion in this breed. They also excel in virtually all canine sports-including agility, flyball, dock diving, rally, and field trials. Choose an activity, and pointers will use their natural talents and athleticism to learn it.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The GSP's coat is coarse and relatively thick but short in length. Grooming is easy, typically only requiring a quick wipe with a grooming mitt and maybe an occasional bath (especially if your dog finds an odor to roll in). However, be prepared for steady shedding. The small hairs of the GSP are known to be shed on furniture, floors, and clothes.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Since these dogs were bred to be people-oriented, they have a strong desire to please their owners. Cultivate and develop this tendency through early and ongoing obedience training. You'll have an attentive, well-behaved dog, and your GSP will better understand what you expect.</p><p>The gun dog persona is so intertwined with the personality of the GSP that many puppies exhibit pointing behavior on their own. An intense gaze, lowered stance, and a pointed foreleg often comes naturally to the breed. If you're planning to adopt this breed for hunting, you're sure to be pleased with the ease of training for this work.</p><p>These dogs generally get along well with others, but their high prey drive can lure them into chasing cats or other small pets. While the GSP is generally obedient when it comes to recalls, this prey drive can cloud your dog's better judgment and lead to wild chases. Use caution if you exercise this breed off-leash.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Likely thanks to its genetically diverse background, the GSP is a relatively hearty breed. These dogs don't experience health problems often, though their active nature may make them susceptible to injury.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The German shorthaired pointer knows how to work up an appetite. This active dog breed won't need much persuasion to eat a meal-but make sure it's a quality, high-protein dog food that will meet your GSP's nutritional needs. Talk with your veterinarian to create a portion plan suitable for your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><p>To maintain athleticism and for a long, healthy life, avoid overfeeding these dogs and give treats in moderation. Like other large breeds, be aware that pointers are sometimes affected by Bloat. Discourage your dog from gulping down his meal, and try to minimize running or high-intensity activity immediately after mealtimes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a German Shorthaired Pointer</h2><p>Hunting for a GSP of your own? Start your search with rescue organizations that might exist in your area or region. This lovable breed sometimes proves to be too active for some individuals or families, but it might be just right for you!</p><p>If you're searching for a German shorthaired pointer breeder, do your research first. While this dog's popularity means that it's not hard to find puppies, it's important to find a responsible GSP breeder. Ask to meet one or both parents of the litter and ensure the breeder has clear medical test results for hips, elbows, and eyes. Puppies typically cost between $500 and $1,500, but prices may be higher depending on their pedigree and availability.</p><h2>German Shorthaired Pointer Overview</h2><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Eager to please</p><p>Excellent swimmers</p><p>Extreme energy</p><p>May have strong prey drive</p><p>Considerable shedding</p>",1202

They are sometimes referred to as a long-haired Russian Blue, but although the two cat breeds are related and similar in appearance, they are not the same.</p><p>Nebelung cats can be shy in new situations or with new people, and prefer a home without too much noise or tumult.

Nebelung means 'creature of the mist' in German, as a nod to their beautiful, shiny silver-blue coat. Despite the German name, the breed originated in the United States.</p><p>In the early 1980s, the breed's founder, Cora Cobb, gifted her son a female black domestic short-hair cat. When this cat mated with a short-haired blue-furred male that looked much like a Russian Blue, it resulted in a litter of six kittens, one of which was a male with long blue-gray fur. Cora was taken with this cat, and she kept him and called him Siegfried.</p><p>Not long after this, her son's cat had another litter from the same father, and this time there was a female kitten with the same type of long, blue-gray hair. Cora also kept her and called her Brunhilde.</p><p>Cora started a breeding program with Siegfried and Brunhilde, and over the next decade, steadily bred the cats while using Russian Blue cats as ""outcrosses"" to increase the genetic diversity of the new breed. Originally, the Nebelung was presented as basically a long-haired Russian blue, and held to the same breed standards.</p><p>This didn't go down well with some Russian Blue breeders, however, and the Nebelung was given status as an entirely new breed by The International Cat Association in 1987 and then, later, the American Cat Fanciers Association. It has yet to be formally recognized by the Cat Fanciers Federation or the overall Cat Fanciers Association, though.</p><h2>Nebelung Care</h2><p>Nebelung cats are known for being very gentle and undemanding, but they also have a playful side. You should make sure you have lots of appropriate toys and other forms of enrichment around the house to keep your feline stimulated, exercised, and entertained. If you start while your cat is young, you can train your Nebelung to walk on a leash, which is a great way to provide extra exercise, relieve boredom, and spend quality time with your pet.</p><p>Nebelungs are known to thrive on routine, and lots of changes can often make them feel unsettled and anxious. This aspect of their personality, combined with their reserved nature around strangers, means that they benefit from early and ongoing socialization to help minimize the chances of them becoming overly shy or nervous.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Nebelung cats do not have any known tendency towards any specific health conditions, but like any cat, may develop a health condition or illness during their lifetime. As a general rule, however, Nebelung cats are long-lived and often reach the age of 18 or even older.</p><p>It is important to ensure that you do not overfeed your pet. Obesity in cats is common, and it can lead to a lot of related health conditions, including diabetes and arthritis. Nebelungs can be fussy eaters, but once they find a food they like, they can easily become overweight if allowed to eat too much.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Nebelung is a medium-sized cat with a long, muscular, agile body. It has medium-length, dense fur that is a blue-gray in color, usually with silvery tips. These cats have a long, plumed tail that balances their long bodies and adds to their overall delicate beauty. There should be no patches of white or other colors on the cat's body, although the fur behind the cat's ears can be a lighter blue than the rest of the coat. Male Nebelungs sometimes have a thicker ruff of fur around their necks.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all cats, Nebelungs require a diet that is high in protein, moderate in fats, and low in carbohydrates. They should be fed a high-quality cat food formulated for their age-for example, kitten, adult, or senior. Your cat should always have access to fresh water.</p><p>Most adult cats do well with two meals per day, while kittens need more frequent, but smaller, meals. You can feed your pet an all-kibble diet, feed only wet food, or offer both, but don't allow your cat to overeat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Nebelung Cat</h2><p>Because they are a new and rare breed, you will probably have to wait to secure a Nebelung from a reputable breeder. You could also have to travel further afield to find one. The rarity of this breed means it is very unlikely you'll find one at a shelter or rescue.</p><p>The Russian Blue is a more common breed, though, and you may be able to find this shorter-haired cat with a similar personality in a cat rescue somewhere across the country or even locally.</p><p>As with any breed of cat, attending a cat show can be a good way to find breeders, as well as see a particular cat breed in person.</p><h2>Nebelung Overview</h2><p>The Nebelung is a beautiful, blue-gray cat with medium-length fur and large green eyes. These shimmery and delicate-appearing animals are loyal and devoted pets to their preferred family members, but can be shy with strangers or with children or animals who are too rambunctious. They are active and curious cats with a high level of intelligence, but they also enjoy giving affection to and receiving affection from their humans.</p><p>Nebelungs are content to spend time on their own, and easily tolerate a separation while their owner is at work or away for the day, but they do not enjoy being left alone for much more than that.</p><p>Forms strong bonds with owners</p><p>Well-suited to apartment living</p><p>Intelligent and playful</p><p>Become nervous if under-socialized</p><p>Need a routine</p><p>Rare and expensive</p>",1243

It's known for its well-feathered underbelly, tail, legs, and ears. All setter breeds, including English setters, are popular companion dogs known for being affectionate, gentle, and adaptable.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 27 inches (male); 23 to 25 inches (female)</p><p>WEIGHT: 65 to 80 pounds (male); 45 to 55 pounds (female)</p><p>COAT: Flat, silky, medium-length single coat, with feathering on the ears, chest, legs, and tail</p><p>COAT COLOR: White coat base with 'Belton' markings include flecks or intermingled roan (Belton colors are orange or black-referred to as blue-or tricolored)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, energetic, lively, independent, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United Kingdom</p><h2>Characteristics of the English Setter</h2><p>Providing they get enough exercise, the English setter can make a wonderful addition to a household. They're a popular choice for families as they have a friendly and mellow demeanor. These dogs usually love to spend time with their fellow housemates, both two- and four-legged. They're gentle with respectful children and usually enjoy the company of other dogs. With the right introductions, they can also live peaceably with cats.</p><h2>History of the English Setter</h2><p>The breed is widely regarded as being one of the oldest of the gundog breeds. There are artworks featuring dogs closely resembling the modern-day English setter from as far back as the 15th century.</p><p>They were initially called setting spaniels and they would range out in front of the hunter on open ground and would then freeze and crouch down (set), or point, when they found their quarry. Hunters originally used nets to trap the bird, but the gun then replaced these during the 18th century. They became popular with the nobility that owned large estates.</p><p>While their exact ancestry isn't known, it's thought they may have resulted through the crossing of pointing and spaniel breeds. They're known for being more gentle and slightly smaller than the Irish or Gordon setter.</p><p>In the 19th century, Edward Laverack began breeding English setters in earnest, and they were often crossed with those dogs belonging to R. Purcell Llewellin. The dogs were even sometimes referred to as Laverack or Llewellin setters to reflect their lineage, and they provided the foundations of the breed we know today. There was a focus on an athletic physique, prominent feathering, a glossy coat, and unique markings.</p><p>The Laverack line became known as being the show-type, and the Llewellin were developed for their field qualities.</p><p>In the 1870s, the first English setter was imported to the United States, and the AKC recognized them in 1884.</p><p>In the 1930s one English setter gained fame in the States. There's now a sculpture of 'Jim the Wonderdog' in a park in Missouri. It was alleged that he could predict the future and understand several languages. Skeptics, quite fairly, claimed it was just an intelligent dog that had been taught certain commands and was primed by its owner.</p><p>English setters continue to be a popular choice amongst the hunting community, but they're now often desirable as companion dogs given their gentle countenance.</p><h2>English Setter Care</h2><p>Because setters thrive in company, this breed is best suited to living in a household where they will have company for most of the day. You should still work on helping them to feel relaxed if they're left on their own for short periods to help prevent separation anxiety from developing. They need an average amount of grooming, with a little more attention on their feathered features.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Make sure your English setter gets an appropriate amount of daily exercise. Usually an hour a day, divided into two periods of 30 minutes each, will suffice. Although they're energetic and can make great hiking companions, they don't require as much exercise as some of the other gun dog breeds, but when they do exercise, make it a vigorous session preferably off-leash in a secure and fenced area.</p><p>Their keen intelligence and athleticism mean they can also make great dog sports competitors, and they often excel in the likes of agility and, with their fantastic nose, scent work trials.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>English setters are moderate shedders. They benefit from a good weekly brush out to keep their coat in good condition and to prevent any tangles, mats, or knots from developing in their abundant feathering. You may wish to trim some areas of your English setter's feathered areas or around the ears.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>They're eager to please and respond very well to reward-based training methods. English setters' gentle temperament means they can be particularly sensitive to harsh treatment so it's never a good idea to withdraw attention or yell loudly at this breed or they can become distressed.</p><p>Some English setters can have a high prey drive, given their hunting background. This may mean they have to remain on the leash in areas where there's too much temptation to ""hunt,"" or you'll have to work extra hard to achieve a rock-solid recall.</p><p>While they're soft-hearted, English setters do like to alert you to strangers, and you should work on rewarding quiet behavior to avoid alert barking from getting out of control.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>English setters are generally regarded as healthy, but, as with any breed, they're known for a few genetic health conditions.</p><p>Hip and elbow dysplasia: This health issue occurs when the joint forms abnormally, and it can cause mobility issues and pain. It's one of the most common genetic health conditions across all breeds and can range in its severity. In severe cases, surgery may be required to increase your dog's quality of life.</p><p>Hypothyroidism: If your dog suffers from an underactive thyroid, its metabolism slows down, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including weight gain, lethargy, and problems with the skin and coat. It can't be cured, but with the right treatment, it can be managed successfully.</p><p>Allergies: Environmental and food allergies are more common in English setters than in some breeds. Often a careful process of elimination will be required to try to establish the underlying cause. Changes in diet and medication can also be helpful, and it's important to consult with your vet to work out the best course of action if a problem is severe or persistent.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, you should feed your English setter high-quality and properly portion-controlled food. As already mentioned, the breed can be more prone to developing allergies. If these are food-related, you may need to feed them a specific diet to ensure it doesn't trigger a reaction.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an English Setter</h2><p>If you're buying a puppy, to ensure that they're healthy, happy, and well-socialized, you should always seek out a reputable breeder. By not doing this, you could be inadvertently supporting the unethical and often cruel puppy farming trade.</p><p>You want your pup to be raised in a home environment with their mother and other members of their litter. The breeder should have done health checks on the parents, and they shouldn't release the pups to their new homes until they're, at least, eight weeks old.</p><h2>English Setter Overview</h2><p>Gentle and affectionate</p><p>Energetic, but calm if given appropriate exercise</p><p>Intelligent and eager to please</p><p>Can sometimes alert bark</p><p>May have a high prey drive</p><p>Can be prone to separation anxiety</p>",1204
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/curly-coated-retriever-dog-breed-profile-4770739,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Sporting Dog Breeds,<h1>Curly-Coated Retriever (Curly): Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Curly-Coated Retriever (Curly): Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>Curly-coated retrievers are a large sporting breed from England with floppy ears, athletic bodies, webbed feet for swimming, and a signature curly double coat. These even-tempered and lovable dogs look like a cross between a poodle and Labrador, but they're actually a breed all their own. Prized for being hardworking and loyal, these retrievers are recognizable by their dense, tight curls lying close to the body in a deep black or rich liver color.</p><p>Originating in England in the 18<sup>th</sup>century, the curly-coated retriever-also referred to as a curly or CCR-is rare when compared to other common types of retrievers like the Labrador or golden retriever. However, their popularity isn't a reflection of the breed's suitability for life at home or in the field.</p><p>Like many other sporting dogs, the curly-coated retriever has seemingly endless energy to give when on the hunt or engaged in a task. These driven canines were bred to retrieve game for hours on end under varying weather conditions. This history has given these dogs an admirable work ethic, but at home, they're calm companions that settle down easily and are comfortable with adults and children alike.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 25 to 27 inches (males); 23 to 25 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 60 to 95 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short double coat with tight curls</p><p>Coat Color: Solid black or liver</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, confident, friendly, trainable, active</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Curly-Coated Retriever</h2><p>If you're familiar with the gregarious nature of Labrador retrievers and golden retrievers, you might be surprised to find that the curly-coated retriever is significantly more reserved. They're not overly timid or shy; in fact, many people describe these dogs as having a confident, dignified temperament. However, they aren't as eager to excitedly greet new faces. For this reason, it's important to make sure young curlies are well socialized. How well they do with strangers, other pets, and children will often depend on how much early socialization they have. These dogs are very affectionate with their families, and they can have friendly personalities with other pets when raised together from a young age.</p><h2>History of the Curly-Coated Retriever</h2><p>The history of the curly-coated retriever isn't clear, with no documented evidence of when and where the breed came into existence. However, it's generally believed that the curly is the oldest of the retriever breeds.</p><p>Piecing together the dog's appearance in early literature, registry clubs, and dog shows, it's been concluded that the breed originated in England in the 18th century. The AKC notes that the curly-coated retriever was most likely developed by breeding other game dogs like the English Water Spaniel and Retrieving Setter. While these two early founding breeds are now extinct, the curly-coated retriever remains in existence with high populations in Australia, Europe, and the United States.</p><p>Other breeds likely contributed to the development of the CCR as we know it today. The St. John's Water Dog (also extinct) is one possibility. Additionally, the tight curls are significant indicators that the breed also benefited from crossbreeding with the Irish Water Spaniel and even later, the Poodle.</p><p>In the 1860s, the curly-coated retriever received attention at dog shows throughout England while continuing to prove its versatility in the field as a hunting companion. Demand for these capable canines increased, and they were exported to Australia and New Zealand. According to the AKC, the breed first entered the United States in 1907 and received official recognition in 1924. While we may not know much about the breed's early origins, the dedication of the curly community is clear today. </p><h2>Curly-Coated Retriever Care</h2><p>With the right balance of exercise and training, a curly-coated retriever makes a great companion for active households. This breed's signature coat is relatively simple to maintain, requiring only standard baths along with routine grooming care for the nails, teeth, and ears.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The curly-coated retriever is a leggy and athletic-looking canine, which gives an indicator that these dogs are not meant to be couch potatoes. Don't underestimate or neglect the intelligence of curly-coated retrievers; they're incredibly smart, so they excel-and stay out of trouble-when given exercise and a job to do.</p><p>Give your curly at least 30 to 60 minutes of vigorous exercise each day along with plenty of mental stimulation to raise a well-balanced dog. Activities like running, long walks, hikes, or bike rides are great options, while exercises specific to the breed's instincts like swimming and playing fetch will also help keep your dog's mind occupied.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Likely the most recognizable feature of the CCR is its curls. While the body is covered in a dense coat of curls, it should be noted that the face, forelegs, and feet have short, straight fur. Compared to other retrievers, and many dog breeds in general, the curly-coated retriever is very low-maintenance when it comes to grooming. The distinctive curls benefit most from a quick wipe with a damp cloth, as brushing them leads to frizz.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>CCR puppies are eager to learn and can begin training with basic obedience lessons as early as eight weeks of age. Hunters and outdoorsmen will find that this breed is a natural at hunting and retrieving game and waterfowl. Even if hunting isn't on your radar, curlies will stay happy with training to perform small retrieving or carrying tasks. Owners can also give these dogs the opportunity to shine in agility, flyball, or other canine sports.</p><p>Like most retrievers, the curly uses its mouth for many things in life-it loves to carry or chew on objects and needs to be taught not to nip. If this breed is left alone long enough for boredom to strike, it's likely to find its own entertainment by chewing on items around the house.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Curly-coated retrievers generally exhibit good health and stamina. However, they are prone to a few common health problems that prospective owners should be aware of.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Curly-coated retrievers are an active, athletic breed, so it's important to feed these dogs protein-rich and high-quality dog food. Dogs that exercise considerably each day will also require more food to fulfill their calorie needs.</p><p>Since this breed is prone to bloat, it's best to feed your curly several smaller meals per day rather than one large portion, which reduces the possibility of the dog gulping down food too quickly. Talk to your veterinarian to learn more and develop a diet plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Curly-Coated Retriever</h2><p>The curly-coated retriever offers the agility and lovable personality that retrievers are known for, and its unique coat makes it stand out among its peers. However, since they're less popular than Labrador and golden retrievers, they're not as likely to be found in local shelters. To find one of these special retrievers to join your family, check out breed-specific rescue groups that help these lovable dogs find new homes.</p><h2>Curly-Coated Retriever Overview</h2><p>Highly intelligent and trainable</p><p>Minimal grooming needs</p><p>Dignified and quiet nature</p><p>Requires vigorous daily exercise</p><p>Can be reserved with strangers</p><p>Prone to serious inherited health conditions</p>",1161

Often referred to as Sammies, these gentle dogs are easily recognizable by their thick and fluffy white fur. Samoyeds crave attention and are more than happy to put in a bit of work for their humans, be it herding, hunting, or hauling a sled.</p><p>Sammies are perfectly optimized to withstand cold weather. They have an incredibly efficient double coat that insulates them against freezing temperatures, and their upturned mouths prevent drool-and thus, icicles-from forming at their lips. Despite their inherent hardiness, Samoyeds are just as glad to lounge around as a family pet as they are to perform a job. With their friendly nature and easy-to-please personalities, Sammies make excellent companion dogs provided they get plenty of love and attention.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 21 to 23.5 inches (males); 19 to 21 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 45 to 60 pounds (males); 35 to 50 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Double coat with thick undercoat and straight outercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Primarily bright white, sometimes cream or biscuit (very light brown)</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Playful, friendly, loyal, energetic, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Siberia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Samoyed</h2><p>The Samoyed is especially playful with its family, and its friendly temperament carries over to strangers, kids, and pets alike. This herding breed has a long history of working with other animals, so Samoyeds should only require basic socialization at first to maintain amiable personalities. They do have a prey drive, however, so they may need training to avoid chasing smaller dogs or cats. As high-energy dogs, Sammies are best suited for owners with plenty of time to dedicate to their daily exercise and training needs.</p><p>These dogs can do fine in warm temperatures, but don't be surprised if your Samoyed refuses to come inside in cold weather. Like other arctic breeds, snowy days are cause for celebration in the Samoyed's mind, and your dog will be especially happy to play outside with you or bury itself in a snowy mound. Some owners even provide kiddie pools filled with ice during the summer for this breed to play in as a special treat.</p><h2>History of the Samoyed</h2><p>It may come as no surprise that the hardy, thick-coated Samoyed originates from Russia, a country where frigid temperatures demand a well-insulated barrier against the cold. Their name comes from the semi-nomadic Samoyede people of Siberia, who have relied on the breed for centuries for activities like hunting, herding reindeer, pulling sleds, and snuggling for warmth on freezing Arctic nights.</p><p>Sammies are classified as a basal breed, meaning their existence pre-dates the origins of most modern dog breeds. Their strong work ethic and incredibly friendly nature have made Samoyeds a great companion to humans throughout their long existence, which has helped the breed proliferate. Arctic explorers first brought these dogs to England in the late 18th century, where their regal coats and warm personalities made them a fast favorite among the English elite. They were the breed of choice for Alexandra of Denmark, who became Queen of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions in 1901 after the death of Queen Victoria.</p><p>In 1906, a dog named Moustan of Argenteau was the first Samoyed officially registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in the United States. While Sammies had already gained popularity among North American mushers, the recognition by the AKC marks the first official instance of Samoyeds being known as a premier, show-worthy breed.</p><h2>Samoyed Care</h2><p>Samoyeds can be exceptional companions and loyal pets, but these dogs don't become their best without some work from their owners. Your Samoyed will need plenty of vigorous exercise and attention daily, along with consistent training and regular grooming. With the right care, this breed can become a beloved member of your family.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>In terms of exercise, Samoyeds require more than many other active breeds. These dogs need at least two hours of activity per day in the form of running, long walks, or active play sessions combined with plenty of one-on-one bonding time with their owners.</p><p>A Sammie who is left to his or her own devices too often may act out due to physical and mental frustrations. Paying extra attention to this breed will help it stay happy and stimulated. Because they're quite accepting of other dogs, having a canine playmate for Sammies is a good way to make sure that all of their exercise needs are met.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Samoyed's fluffy coat doesn't come without responsibilities. These dogs are intense shedders, and they require frequent grooming to look and feel their best. Because of their double coat, dirt and debris can get lost in their fur, which results in mats and tangles. Regular brushings are a key part of Samoyed care, particularly during their peak shedding seasons twice each year.</p><p>While it is possible to properly groom a Samoyed at home, it is often recommended that Sammies receive professional grooming services to ensure that their baths and brushings are done as thoroughly as possible. Owners should also trim their dog's nails, brush their teeth, and clean their ears with a pet-safe cleaner to prevent infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training a Samoyed should be relatively simple once the basics are done, as these dogs form strong bonds with their humans and aim to please. However, this breed is known for having a stubborn streak at times. Obedience lessons should begin when puppies are seven to eight weeks old.</p><p>While your Sammie may take some time to pick up new skills, actively working on training helps your dog understand its role and maintain desirable behaviors. The Samoyed's working history is a benefit for training, as these dogs enjoy the process of learning. Nosework, agility, and herding are all great ways to make use of this breed's natural talents.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Similar to other purebred dogs, Samoyeds have some common health issues, though they are generally regarded as a healthy breed. Responsible breeders will test prospective parents for inherited conditions, and if you adopt a Samoyed puppy, you should be provided with its family medical history.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed this breed high-quality commercial or home-cooked dog food twice per day. Like other dogs, Samoyeds should be watched for signs of weight gain and have their portions limited accordingly if they're packing on too many pounds. In addition to a proper eating schedule, this working breed needs plenty of fresh water to stay hydrated.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Samoyed</h2><p>While Samoyeds aren't especially rare, this breed may be difficult to find in shelters. If you're interested in adopting a Samoyed, check with breed-specific rescues or visit your local shelter to meet a similar dog in need of a forever home.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a Samoyed puppy, it's essential to research responsible breeders. Potential adopters should be able to meet the litter's parents, see the conditions the dogs are kept in, and be provided with their family medical history (including any relevant genetic tests). These puppies typically cost between $600 and $1,500, but prices may be closer to $3,000 depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Samoyed Overview</h2><p>Gentle and friendly temperament</p><p>Can withstand cold climates</p><p>Great for families with children and other pets</p><p>Large amounts of shedding</p><p>Needs lots of time and attention</p><p>Can develop habits like chewing furniture if left alone</p>",1211

This breed is lively, lovable, and playful. The French bulldog is a smaller, distant relative of the English bulldog; while the two share some similarities, each breed has its own distinct characteristics.</p><p>Overall, the French bulldog is a cute, affectionate dog that makes a wonderful pet for all kinds of families. Their small size means they can do well in smaller homes, but they are more sturdy than the average small dog. This is a loyal, intelligent breed that typically gets along well with children and other animals as an excellent family dog.

Be aware that your Frenchie will crave your company and won't do well if left alone for long periods each day. This is a playful breed that loves to be around its owners and children (along with other pets in the household, in most cases).</p><p>French bulldogs typically only bark when there is something that truly needs your attention, which makes them a good breed choice for apartment living. Your Frenchie will enjoy playing in the house or yard, but overall, these dogs do not require much exercise to stay happy and healthy.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Lovable Frenchie</h3><h2>History of the French Bulldog</h2><p>Some controversy surrounds the French bulldog's origins, but the breed undoubtedly originated from the English bulldog. It is believed by many that the English bulldog was bred down in size and then brought to France, where the French bulldog was developed over time. There were many toy English bulldogs being bred around the time that some groups of workers were displaced from England to France, and it is thought that they took the small dogs with them.</p><p>A distinguishing feature of the French bulldog is its bat-like ears, as opposed to the rose-shaped ears of the English bulldog. French fanciers of the toy English bulldogs readily accepted those that had erect ears, which were considered less desirable in England. It is possible that other breeds contributed to the bloodlines of the French bulldog, perhaps including some terriers and the pug.</p><p>French bulldogs became popular with society women in the United States in the late 1800s. The breed standard of the French Bull Dog Club of America was written to say that erect bat ears were the correct ear type.</p><p>The French bulldog has always been known as a beloved companion and quite the lap dog. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1898 and has gradually become more popular since then, rising to a top 10 breed in the United Kingdom, Australia, and the United States in modern years.</p><p>Library of Congress</p><h2>French Bulldog Care</h2><p>French bulldogs require notably less exercise and grooming than many popular dog breeds, but some can use a little extra training (depending on your specific dog's needs). As long as your Frenchie is properly socialized with new people and other animals when first adopted, they should become a friendly and happy companion in your household.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>In general, the Frenchie is more of a lapdog than a jogging partner, but routine exercise is still important with caution. This breed can easily overheat due to its short, stubby nose and potential airway problems. Daily exercise is very important, but don't overdo it: Playing with toys in the house or running around the yard for limited periods of time is best. The French Bulldog Rescue Network notes that Frenchies are poor swimmers, and you will need to supervise this breed around a pool or other water sources.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Frenchies are smooth-coated dogs that tend to shed at a moderate rate. The breed requires little more than basic routine grooming, including weekly brushing. They lose their undercoat in the spring and fall, so owners may want to brush them more during those seasons.</p><p>Trim your dog's nails every few weeks to prevent them from cracking or splitting. It's also recommended to practice preventative oral hygiene by brushing its teeth two to three times per week; this can help keep the breed's common gum infections and dental problems at bay.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Frenchies are smart and willing to learn, and teaching them consistently is a great way to strengthen your bond. This breed also tends to be food-motivated, which is especially helpful when training your dog. French bulldogs can also be difficult to housetrain: Crate training is one way to address this problem, and it's recommended by the AKC.</p><p>Socialization is equally important to ensure your Frenchie is well-adjusted to their environment. You can begin teaching this breed basic obedience as early as eight weeks old, and it's helpful to take your puppy to training and socialization classes when they're ready. This is a great way to teach your dog new commands while helping it become more comfortable around new people and other dogs.</p><h3>Safety Tips</h3><p>Along with its limits on exercise, the French bulldog's face shape also affects the safety of some other common situations like travel. Take extra precautions when traveling with this breed to ensure your Frenchie doesn't overheat, especially noting to never leave your dog unattended in a vehicle. The French Bulldog Rescue Network notes that if air travel is required, your Frenchie should ride with you in a carrier in the passenger compartment.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible dog breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred with these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions, but some hereditary health problems can still occur in the French bulldog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>French bulldogs should typically be fed two meals a day. Provide up to 3/4 cup of dry dog food per meal or homemade dog food supervised by a veterinarian. More specific amounts of food your dog requires will depend on its size, activity level, age, and medical history, so it's best to discuss these nutritional needs with your veterinarian to develop a meal plan suitable for your Frenchie's physique and lifestyle. It's also important to monitor your dog's weight, as canine obesity can shorten a dog's life and create uncomfortable living conditions at any age.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a French Bulldog</h2><p>While there are many responsible breeders of French bulldogs located nationwide, this breed can also be found in local shelters and breed-specific rescues. If you plan to adopt a Frenchie from a breeder, be sure to work with one that readily provides verified medical records and references for their dogs.</p><h2>French Bulldog Overview</h2><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Good family pet</p><p>Infrequent barkers</p><p>Can easily overheat</p><p>Cannot partake in a lot of running/exercise or high-intensity activities</p><p>Prone to breathing issues</p>",1181

They are prized for truffle hunting skills, but they can also make relatively laid-back and affectionate companions around the home. Lagottos are known for their thick coats that are both water-resistant and low in shedding, and these dogs are also enthusiastic swimmers thanks to their roots in duck hunting.</p><p>With their friendly personalities, Lagottos are popular family dogs suitable for homes with children or active owners. They are highly trainable and can adapt to a variety of lifestyles.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 17 to 19 inches (males); 16 to 18 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 28 to 35 pounds (males); 24 to 30 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Wooly, curly, water-resistant double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Solid off-white, white with orange or brown patches, brown, brown roan, brown or orange with white patches, or occasionally tan markings</p><p>Life Span: 14 to 17 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, athletic, friendly, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Lagotto Romagnolo</h2><p>While Lagottos have become popular truffle hunting dogs, they were originally bred for duck hunting (hence their signature curly coats), and their instincts for swimming and retrieving still remain in modern generations. This breed enjoys stimulation and exercise each day, but your Lagotto will also be happy to relax around the house with family members when not being active.</p><p>These dogs are affectionate toward their owners, but they also require consistent training: Since they have plenty of energy and intelligence to pair with it, Lagottos may entertain themselves by getting into mischief around the house if not offered more vigorous activity than daily walks. Thankfully, this breed can be trained easily with the right guidance.</p><h2>History of the Lagotto Romagnolo</h2><p>The Lagotto Romagnolo is thought to be one of the oldest of all the water dogs. They originate from the Romagna region of Northeast Italy, and translates from the local dialect as 'Duck Dog.'</p><p>They are thought to have been around for over one thousand years. They were used by locals of the region to hunt for waterfowl in the vast marshlands that covered much of the region in days gone by. Their size, agility, eagerness to please and water-resistant coat meant they were perfectly suited to this task.</p><p>The 19th century saw the large-scale draining of much of the marshlands in the region. This meant Lagottos were no longer required for the work they were used to. However, their adaptability meant that they continued to be a popular working breed, and they were developed for their skills as truffle hunters in the region.</p><p>During this time, they were often crossed with other breeds known for their hunting and scenting skills, and it meant that the population of the purebred Lagotto dwindled-so much that by the 1970s, they became almost extinct.</p><p>Lagottos are also becoming increasingly popular as an adaptable and relatively laid-back companion breed. They are not as busy as some of their other working counterparts. Demand for the breed is increasing in other countries, and in 2015, they were recognized by the American Kennel Club.</p><h2>Lagotto Romagnolo Care</h2><p>The Lagotto Romagnolo is an intelligent working breed that needs to be kept well-exercised and properly enriched around the house. That said, they are not as busy as some other working breeds. They can be a little more laid-back around the home, and this can make them appealing even for those living in an apartment.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>When outside, be prepared for your Lagotto to have a great love of water. Swimming can be a great way to help them burn off steam, so don't be surprised if you find it hard to get them out of a river or pond once they have discovered it. Their water-repellant double coat and purpose-built body shape are all geared towards them spending a lot of time in the water.</p><p>Because they have been developed for their truffle hunting skills, they also have strong scenting abilities and often a great love of digging. You may need to put in extra work to ensure that they do not start digging in undesired areas of your garden. Some Lagotto owners provide a dedicated sandpit and take part in scent trials and nose work games to give them an outlet for this desire.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>They are a very bright breed and are keen to please their owner. They respond well to positive reinforcement training methods and can begin training at about eight weeks of age. With appropriate early socialization and ongoing training, they can be very adaptable, affectionate, and happy dogs. They often fit in well to a family environment and can live happily alongside other pets.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Lagotto can be a good choice for individuals that suffer from dog hair allergies. No dog is truly hypoallergenic; it is often the dander on the skin that can cause a problem. The Lagotto, however, hardly sheds, so this means you will not have a hair-filled home. Their coat needs to be groomed out regularly to prevent it from becoming matted, tangled, and uncomfortable. Some owners prefer to shave these dogs' hair short in the summer when the dogs are outdoors in high heat.</p><p>Their ears are hairier than some breeds to help prevent them from becoming waterlogged, but this extra hair can sometimes become overgrown and cause a build-up of wax and debris. They may need to have excess hair removed periodically to prevent this problem.</p><p>Care should also be taken if you are trimming their nails. Lagottos have naturally longer and more curved nails than some breeds. This is to help them with their truffle digging abilities. It means the quick (the blood vessel inside the nail) is longer than average, and you don't want to cut into this accidentally. Not only will you have to stop the bleeding, but it will be painful and could cause your dog to develop an aversion towards nail trimming. You may have to go back to basics with getting them used to the activity.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Lagotto is known for being a healthy breed with great longevity. It is not uncommon for them to live up to 17 years. Like most breeds, they can still be prone to particular inheritable health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>All dogs should be fed a high-quality and appropriately portion-controlled diet, and the Lagotto Romagnolo is no exception. Your Lagotto's food should be made predominantly from meat. Two servings of food per day is the standard feeding schedule for this breed.</p><p>Canine obesity is one of the most prominent problems in companion dogs worldwide, and it can lead to a whole host of other (often serious) health conditions. Making sure you do not overfeed your Lagotto should be a priority.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Lagotto Romagnolo</h2><p>The Lagotto Romagnolo is still relatively rare in the United States. This means you may have to travel a little further or be added to a waiting list if you are keen to secure a puppy. Don't let your enthusiasm allow you to make rash decisions: Always make sure you seek out a reputable breeder. Their pups should be well socialized, kept with their mother in a home environment, and up-to-date on all relevant health checks.</p><p>The Lagotto Romagnolo Club of America is a good place to start your research. Puppies from responsible breeders typically cost between $1,800 and $2,500, but prices can be as high as $5,000 (often fluctuating based on regional availability).</p><h2>Lagotto Romagnolo Overview</h2><p>Forms strong bonds with family</p><p>A more laid-back working breed</p><p>Eager to please and trainable</p><p>Their coat needs a lot of maintenance</p><p>Can be vocal</p><p>They can be prolific diggers</p>",1250

Sometimes known as a rattie, this breed has a muscular, compact, and well-proportioned body with perky ears and an alert face that's always ready for action. Although rat terriers are born hunters-and make excellent watchdogs-they can be loving, affectionate, and loyal to their family members. With the proper training and socialization, they can also be friendly with strangers and other medium-size to larger pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier Group</p><p>HEIGHT: Generally, 10 to 13 inches for miniature Rat Terriers and 13 to 18 inches for standard Rat Terriers</p><p>WEIGHT: 10 to 25 pounds</p><p>COAT: Smooth, shiny, and short coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Comes in pied (meaning one or more colors with large patches of white) patterns; common colors include black and white with rust, tan, lemon, blue, red, chocolate, or orange</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 18 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, inquisitive, affectionate, lively, alert, loving</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Rat Terrier</h2><p>Rat terriers are ideal for active families with a large, fenced-in space to run around and exercise excess energy. Like many smaller breeds, rat terriers can become destructive when they're bored. It's also important to note that rat terriers have extremely strong prey drives, so they shouldn't be allowed to romp off-leash in open spaces where they can meet up with small animals.</p><h2>History of the Rat Terrier</h2><p>An American breed that was developed by breeding the fox terrier, bull terrier, Manchester terrier, and old English white terrier-among others-the rat terrier was originally bred to catch prey and hunt pests, such as rats, on farms, which is how they got their name.</p><p>Throughout the 1910s and 1920s, rat terrier breeders worked to propagate certain skills, resulting in several new lines in the breed. In the Midwest, rat terriers were bred with whippets and Italian greyhounds to produce quick dogs that could help control jackrabbit populations. In Central and Southwest America, they were bred with beagles to improve upon their hunting skills and to create more pack-oriented dogs. In the 1920s, toy fox terriers that were too large for their breeding programs were bred with rat terriers, resulting in toy-sized, or miniature, rat terriers.</p><p>The rat terrier was common on American farms, but populations began to decline in the 1940s and 1950s when farmers began to use poison to control pests and vermin. A small number of breeders maintained the breed until they came back into popularity in the 1970s.</p><p>Two other types of rat terriers were developed during this time, including the decker rat terrier and the hairless rat terrier. The decker rat terrier is a slightly larger dog that excels in hunting and will retrieve from water, while the hairless rat terrier is a smaller, hairless dog that comes in miniature and standard sizes.</p><h2>Rat Terrier Care</h2><p>Although rat terriers are low-maintenance in terms of grooming, they are high maintenance in the exercise and training areas. It should come as no surprise that this working dog is highly energetic and has extensive and high daily exercise needs, which makes this dog an excellent pick for active families. Rat terriers also have a propensity to dig, so it's important to provide your rat with a designated digging spot in the backyard.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Because the rat terrier was bred as a working and hunting dog, it has very high energy levels and exercise needs. You can expect to exercise your rat terrier for at least 40 minutes each day-ideally, in a fenced-in space with room to run around. They are fast runners and high jumpers, so make sure the fence is 5 to 6 feet high. Rat terriers have a strong prey drive, so allowing them to play off-leash in an open space isn't recommended. If you don't have a fenced-in area for your rat terrier to run, be sure to take several, vigorous walks each day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Like any breed, it's important to check your rat terrier's ears for debris or signs of infection weekly. If your dog's ears are red, inflamed, or smell funny, schedule a visit with your vet ASAP-these may be signs of injury or infection. If you notice a waxy build-up in your dog's ears, gently clean it with a cotton cloth. Avoid using cotton swabs, as they can damage the delicate inner-ear structures.</p><p>Dental hygiene is also extremely important when it comes to caring for your dog. Daily brushing is ideal, but brushing at least once per week can help protect your dog against dental and oral disease. Dental treats are fine in moderation, but shouldn't be the only method of dental care.</p><p>You can expect to brush your rat terrier only once per week with a rubber mitt or soft brush to remove loose hair and debris. Because they have very short, dense, smooth coats, you can bathe your dog on an as-needed basis. It's important to note that this breed experiences heavier shedding during the fall, spring, and heat cycles.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like many terriers, the rat terrier is highly intelligent and can be extremely stubborn. What's more, this breed can become destructive when they're bored or unstimulated. Training and obedience may be challenging but it's vital for proper behavior and socialization. Keep training interesting-and keep your rat engaged-by incorporating games and rewards. If your rat terrier becomes distracted or you feel your training methods aren't working, try another technique.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Rat terriers are generally healthy dogs, but like all breeds, may be susceptible to certain health conditions. There's no guarantee your rat terrier will-or won't-develop these conditions, but it's important to know the signs and symptoms should they arise in your dog.</p><p>If you're worried about your rat terrier's health, talk to your vet about simple ways you can help him live a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your rat terrier's diet will depend largely on her size, age, and activity levels, but you can expect to feed her between .25 cups (for dogs weighing 10 pounds or less) and 2 cups per day (for dogs weighing between 30 and 40 pounds) of high-protein, high-quality dog food.</p><p>Remember to give treats in moderation. Overeating can lead to dangerous health conditions, like canine heart disease, obesity, and diabetes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Rat Terrier</h2><p>If you choose to buy a rat terrier from a breeder, be sure to do your research to ensure you're working with an ethical, responsible breeder. Ask lots of questions, like ""Where are the puppies kept?"" and ""How many litters do you produce per year?"" If possible, ask to visit the breeding site and to meet the litters' parents. Be on the lookout for signs of backyard breeding, like unsanitary conditions or unhealthy dogs.</p><p>Adopting a rat terrier can cost a few hundred dollars to cover the cost of care. Buying a purebred rat terrier from a breeder might cost you up to $2,000.</p><h2>Rat Terrier Overview</h2><p>Loving, loyal, and affectionate to family members</p><p>Excellent playmates for older kids</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming and bathing</p><p>High energy levels and exercise needs, which may be difficult for busy families</p><p>High drives for chasing and digging</p><p>May be difficult to train, due to their intelligence</p>",1189

Like other coonhounds, this breed is a persistent and devout raccoon hunter. These agile, sleek, and muscular dogs are hardworking hounds that possess great endurance-and can even climb trees. On the other hand, they are extremely devoted pack dogs that make sweet and affectionate pets for active owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 22 to 27 inches (male), 21 to 25 inches (female)</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium-length</p><p>Coat Color: Tricolor, red, white, lemon, bluetick, redtick, or black and white</p><p>Life Span: 11 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, affectionate, active, stubborn</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the American English Coonhound</h2><p>American English Coonhounds are an exceptionally friendly dog breed known to form close bonds with their owners, children, and other pets in the household. While their temperament is easygoing when it comes to meeting new people and spending time with their family, these dogs are also high-energy and stubborn when it comes to training. If a coonhound is not given enough physical and mental stimulation, he or she is likely to have bursts of energy in the house. American English Coonhounds are best-suited to homes with large, fenced-in yards where they can roam freely off the leash and follow their curiosity outdoors.</p><p>These hounds are also known for their unique, expressive personalities and talkative nature. While not all coonhounds show their emotions through barking, they commonly ""chat"" with their owners when it's time to eat, go outside, or simply when they feel bored. When an American English Coonhound is not following their nose outdoors, they'll often pass the time with long naps and calm, laid-back temperament in the house.</p><h2>History of the American English Coonhound</h2><p>The American English Coonhound is one of six American Kennel Club (AKC)-recognized coonhound breeds that were bred by frontiersmen for a very specific purpose. These dogs were designed to both trail and ""tree"" raccoons-because, yes, these dogs are uniquely equipped to climb trees-which early North American settlers discovered were an ideal source of food, fur, and fat.</p><p>American by birth and English by ancestry, it's believed that the American English Coonhound was descended from English Foxhounds that were brought to America in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was then that ""backwoods"" breeders crossed foxhounds with other dogs to create the American English Coonhound. Once referred to as the English Fox and Coonhound, the breed was known for hunting foxes during the day and then raccoons at night. As it turned out, these dogs ultimately specialized in the nocturnal creatures.</p><p> The import of English Foxhounds during America's earliest formative years ultimately revitalized the gene pool used by colonial breeders to create America's various coonhound breeds.</p><p>Ever since colonial times, the American English Coonhound has remained incredibly popular among raccoon hunters, and today it's considered particularly famous for both its incredible endurance and speed. The American English Coonhound has been recorded in the Foundation Stock Service since 1995 and made its first Westminster Kennel Club show appearance in 2012.</p><h2>American English Coonhound Care</h2><p>American English Coonhounds are hardy, healthy dogs that don't require much breed-specific grooming care. However, thanks to their active and stubborn nature, these dogs need to be exercised regularly along with consistent, short sessions of training to reinforce good habits.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The American English Coonhound has a very high energy level. Better yet, they are particularly thrilled to be part of a pack, so they make ideal companions for active families, as they'll be more than happy to join their owners for a run, hike, or even bike ride. These pack dogs will also generally get along well with other pets and children in the home. However, because of their desire to be around their families at all times, these are not dogs that should be left alone for long periods of time.</p><p>The American English Coonhound requires an exceptional amount of exercise, however because of their extremely strong prey drive, they should never be walked off-leash or allowed to play ball or roam freely outdoors without the confines of a strong and sturdy fence. Like other coonhounds, they're likely to climb fences lower than 6 feet tall, and may even take to digging underneath them when following their nose.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>It's important to provide a healthy and balanced diet for these hard-working, active dogs-not only to support their sleek and athletic bodies, but also to keep their coat healthy and shiny. The breed's short and hard protective coat requires weekly brushing (which will also help minimize shedding). Like most breeds, their nails should be trimmed on a regular basis and they should receive regular bathing. Most importantly, clean your coonhound's ears consistently to prevent infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed will require early socialization as puppies, as they are prone to certain behavioral issues such as possessiveness over food or toys. The American English Coonhound is sometimes described as having a ""split"" personality because they can be tenacious and motivated hunters, but also sweet and mellow family companions. The breed's prey drive and seemingly endless energy can sometimes stand in the way of training, as they're not always keen to engage in activities that don't require hunting. Your coonhound may be food-motivated (in the best scenario), but will likely be more consistently attention-motivated as their curiosity can easily drive them away from treats during training.</p><p>These dogs also tend to be a more vocal breed, so they are considered a better match for experienced dog owners. Though they are capable of producing a very loud howl, the American English Coonhound is considered a bit too friendly and sociable with strangers to make for a truly effective watchdog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The American English Coonhound is generally a healthy breed, but because it's still primarily bred as a working dog, this breed should be closely monitored for health conditions. Common health problems are typically related to the joints, eyes, ears, and stomach.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The American English Coonhound should perform well with high-quality commercial or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. However, American English Coonhound owners should be aware that working dogs do have different nutritional needs than dogs that live more sedentary lifestyles. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times for these energetic hounds. As with all breeds, treats should be given in moderation and their diet should be controlled- coonhounds can be particularly susceptible to weight gain and obesity-related issues.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American English Coonhound</h2><p>Be sure to check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for American English Coonhounds that are in need of a forever home. National rescue organizations such as the American English Coonhound Association can be a helpful source of information to help you find your new best friend.</p><p>This breed typically costs between $800 and $1,200, though some breeders may charge upwards of $2,000 for puppies. When adopting an American English Coonhound, it's important to ask your breeder to provide the medical histories of the litter's parents and previous generations in their family tree.</p><h2>American English Coonhound Overview</h2><p>Sociable and friendly with adults, children, and pets</p><p>Hard-working</p><p>Mellow and affectionate</p><p>Strong prey drive</p><p>Vocal</p><p>Requires significant daily exercise and regular human interaction</p>",1205

The affectionate, active, and family-friendly dog is known for its silky, wavy coat; short legs; floppy ears; and distinctive feathered features. Although only officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995, they have a long, noble, and royal lineage.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 12 to 13 inches (to the withers)</p><p>WEIGHT: around 13 to 18 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, sleek and silky coat with feathering around ears, feet, chest, and tail</p><p>COAT COLOR: Four color varieties include tricolor, Blenheim (red and white), ruby, and black and tan</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Playful, affectionate, patient, graceful, sociable, gentle</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h2><p>Cavalier King Charles spaniels are known for generally being incredibly affectionate, sociable, happy-go-lucky, and eager to please. They usually thrive in the company of humans and other dogs and, for this reason, they would suit a household where they will not regularly be left alone.</p><p>They can make great family pets and are also popular with the elderly, as they are not too demanding or hyperactive. Even the most tolerant of breeds should, however, be left undisturbed when sleeping and eating, and children should be guided on the most appropriate way to interact with dogs.</p><h2>History of the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel</h2><p>This companionable breed has long been associated with nobles and royals in Europe, particularly England, from as far back as the 17th century. At this point, the dogs were more widely known as toy spaniels and their appearance could vary somewhat. They were extremely popular with King Charles I and his son King Charles II, which is where their name is derived. King Charles II was said to be so besotted with these dogs that he decreed that they were allowed in any public building, including Parliament.</p><p>The Blenheim color variant was named as a result of the passion that the First Duke of Marlborough, John Churchill, and his wife had for these dogs. They had many dogs of the breed at their home in Blenheim Palace.</p><p>Queen Victoria also loved the breed and her cavalier King Charles spaniel, Dash, was described as her closest childhood companion.</p><p>During Victoria's era, these spaniels began to be crossed more with flatter-faced companion breeds from Asia, such as the pug and the Japanese chin. This led to the development of the English toy spaniel (which is confusingly known as the King Charles spaniel in the United Kingdom).</p><p>In the 1920s, breed enthusiasts began to work towards revitalizing the look of the spaniels from King Charles II and the Duke of Marlborough's time, and this led to the development of the breed we know today. The American Kennel Club only officially recognized the breed in 1995, but since then, it has continued to grow in popularity, and in 2018 it was ranked as the 18th most popular breed by the AKC.</p><h2>Cavalier King Charles Spaniel Care</h2><p>While this breed does often enjoy snuggling up for a cuddle on the sofa, it does not mean that this dog is a couch potato and, although it is classified as a toy breed, this pup still enjoys and benefits from plenty of exercise and training. In addition, if the cavalier's coat is neglected, it can become sloppy and knotted, particularly around the ears.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Though this dog will greatly appreciate a good, solid walk for about 30 to 60 minutes a day, a bit more exercise may be needed for the breed. If you walk your dog for half an hour, then another half an hour spent playing fetch will suffice for your cavalier.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>If you are looking for a breed with a low-maintenance grooming regime, this may not be the dog for you. The dog's feathered ears and feet need regular maintenance to ensure that it does not get tangled or matted. It will need combing out a few times a week, or some owners choose to have the dog's coat clipped down for ease of maintenance and to help keep the pup stay cooler in hot climates. It is a breed that sheds its coat, but not excessively.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Cavalier King Charles spaniels are usually extremely eager to please, and they are very food motivated. This means that they will respond well to positive, force-free training methods and are generally easy to train. These dogs do well in competitive sports, such as agility and obedience.</p><p>The hunting instincts of a spaniel can occasionally surface in this breed. Care must be taken to ensure your dog has a reliable recall and that it is not allowed to chase livestock or small furry animals.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Unfortunately, in part due to their rising popularity and resulting unscrupulous breeding practices, the cavalier King Charles spaniel is a breed that is associated with several potential inheritable health conditions. It is crucial that, if you are buying a puppy, you seek out a responsible and accredited breeder that has done the relevant health screens on the parents.</p><p>Heart Disease: The breed is particularly associated with developing Mitral Valve Disease (MVD). This initially presents as a heart murmur, often at a young age, and it will continue to develop until the dog eventually develops heart failure. While medication can sometimes help to manage the condition, there is no cure, and premature death can occur.</p><p>Syringomyelia (SM): This is another serious condition typically associated with the breed. It results in cavities in the spinal cord filling up with fluid near the brain. It is a progressive condition, which can cause extreme discomfort and pain for the dog, and the speed at which it develops can vary greatly. It cannot be cured, but the pain can often be successfully managed. The condition is sometimes also referred to as ""neck scratchers disease"" as one of the first symptoms can be that the dog obsessively scratches at its neck.</p><p>Joint Problems: Cavaliers are commonly associated with developing hip dysplasia and luxating patella.</p><p>Eye Problems: Cavaliers are prone to eye issues, including cataracts, dry eye syndrome (as a result of problems with their tear ducts), cherry eye, and corneal ulcers.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with every dog, you should feed your cavalier King Charles spaniel a high-quality and appropriately portion-controlled diet with food that is formulated for toy or small breeds. The breed is associated with obesity, so avoid overfeeding them, no matter how much they give you puppy dog eyes.

Lesser-known than its cousin, the tailless Pembroke Welsh Corgi, the Cardigan breed is full of fun antics. These dogs are adaptable, utterly devoted to their family, and ready to do anything you'd like-just as long as you're together.</p><p>This breed may be reserved with strangers at first, but given ample time, will usually warm up to new friends and share some of the abundant love they shower on their family. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi gets along great with other animals, from pets like dogs and cats to horses and other farm animals. They love having children in their families and naturally look after them as part of their pack.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Weight: 25 to 38 pounds</p><p>Height: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, dense, water-resistant double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Red, sable, brindle, black, or blue merle; most commonly with white markings on the neck, chest, legs, muzzle, tail, and face</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, friendly, playful, intelligent, active, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Wales</p><h2>Characteristics of the Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h2><p>This breed is known for its playful temperament and larger-than-life personality. Your Cardigan Welsh Corgi will enjoy spending time with you and showing plenty of affection to close family members. These dogs are naturally attentive, which can make them excellent watchdogs that alert their owners to any sign of trouble with a quick bark. It also means that you may need to work on excessive barking if you live in an apartment, though this breed is otherwise well-suited for apartment living as long as it's provided with daily walks.</p><h2>History of the Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h2><p>This Welsh dog breed has existed for thousands of years in the Cardiganshire area in Wales (today's Ceredigion), brought to Wales by Celtic tribes who migrated from Central Europe. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi was named for its home region. Centuries ago, this rocky, coastal area of Cardiganshire was filled with green hills and dairy farms.</p><p>The reason these dogs were bred with such short legs comes down to their working history: Cardigan Welsh Corgis were highly prized as indispensable cattle herders, and their short height kept them safely below the herd's dangerous kicks. They also worked as drovers (which drive cattle to market), farm dogs, and barn guards while serving as loving family companions.</p><h2>Cardigan Welsh Corgi Care</h2><p>With basic obedience training, moderate exercise, and standard grooming, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi can be a happy, well-adjusted dog. When this breed becomes part of your family, they'll be happy to tag along for plenty of activities and learn new tricks.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Cardigan Welsh Corgis need moderate exercise to stay healthy. Although they have ample energy and enjoy physical activities, they don't need an excessive amount like many other working breeds. Provide your dog with several daily walks or a fenced-in backyard to run around in, taking note that it's best to keep this breed on a leash when it's outside the safe boundaries of a fence. Their herding nature makes them likely to chase after other animals, but some (especially farm dogs) can be trained efficiently with recalls to return quickly to their owners. Also thanks to their working history, these dogs enjoy agility sports to exercise their body and mind.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi's double coat is easy to care for, requiring no trimming. It does not tend to mat, but a throughout brush-out once a week is important to keep shedding to a minimum. Their coats repel dirt and water, needing only occasional baths. Trim the nails weekly and check the ears, cleaning them with a pet-safe ear cleaner if they appear dirty.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training your puppy from day one, and your Cardigan Welsh Corgi will quickly and happily learn good manners and house rules. The breed is intelligent and naturally wants to please you, so gentle, positive training methods are very effective. Many Cardigans excel at activities like agility, flyball, obedience, and herding.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is built somewhat heavy for their size with long backs and short legs. Due to the breed's unique physique, care must be taken to ensure the Cardigan doesn't injure its back. Don't let puppies jump up or down from high places (try using pet ramps for couches and beds), and if you lift the dog, provide even support under the front and rear legs.</p><p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is generally very healthy, but like all purebred dogs, it's important to work with a responsible breeder who tests both parents and puppies for hereditary problems.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Avoid overfeeding your Cardigan Welsh Corgi. Staying lean and avoiding canine obesity can prevent the development of back issues, hip dysplasia, and other diet-related medical issues like diabetes. Feed scheduled meals, measuring the food with a cup or scale. Ask your breeder or veterinarian to recommend a high-quality diet and specific portion sizes to keep your Cardigan Welsh Corgi healthy.</p><h2>The Difference Between Cardigan and Pembroke Welsh Corgis</h2><p>You might think the only difference between the two Corgis is the Cardigan's tail (and the Pembroke's lack thereof), but this couldn't be further from the truth. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi, although related, are completely separate breeds with different physical and temperamental characteristics.</p><p>The ancestors of today's Cardigan Welsh Corgi existed in the Cardiganshire area in Wales as far back as 3,000 years ago, which makes the Cardigan nearly 2,000 years older than the Pembroke Welsh Corgi. The Cardigan Welsh Corgi is descended from teckel dogs, which is a family of dogs that includes the Dachshund. When Vikings arrived in Wales, the spitz-type dogs that accompanied them were bred with Cardigan Welsh Corgis, and the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was born.</p><p>In 1925, the Kennel Club of England officially recognized both Cardigans and Pembrokes as one Corgi breed, but breed fanciers protested and the Kennel Club split them into two breeds in 1934. However, during this decade of time, the two breeds were interbred. Since being separated, the Cardigan Welsh Corgi and Pembroke Welsh Corgi have not been co-mingled.</p><p>Physically, the Cardigan is slightly bigger and heavier-boned than the Pembroke. The Cardigan also has larger, more rounded ears. The Cardigan, of course, has a long tail, and the Pembroke's tail is usually docked if they are not born tailless. The Cardigan also has a wider variety of colors than the Pembroke.</p><p>Temperamentally, the two Corgi breeds are similar with a few minor differences. They are both intelligent, active, and fun-loving. Some people believe the Pembroke is more outgoing than the Cardigan, which can be reserved with strangers. Cardigans might also be slightly more laidback than Pembrokes, though your specific's dog temperament will be heavily influenced by its family history.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cardigan Welsh Corgi</h2><p>The best way to adopt a Cardigan Welsh Corgi is to rescue one in need of a forever home. Many adult Cardigans can be found through rescues, and occasionally, litters of puppies may be available for adoption. To search for a Cardigan in need of rehoming, check with the Cardigan Welsh Corgi Club of America (the national parent club for the breed in the United States), and check your local shelters and rescue groups.</p><h2>Cardigan Welsh Corgi Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and fun-loving</p><p>Devoted family companion</p><p>Easy-care coat</p><p>Some are problem barkers</p><p>May be reserved</p><p>Doesn't like to be left alone</p>",1227

For owners looking for an active, happy, and affectionate family member, the Welsh springer spaniel could be a perfect match.</p><p>The Welsh springer spaniel is a close relative of the English springer spaniel, and these two types of dogs share an ancient history. The Welsh breed is slightly smaller and is only found with red and white markings, but it has several similar personality traits to its English cousins.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 18 to 19 inches (males); 17 to 18 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 40 to 55 pounds (male); 35 to 50 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat: Soft, straight, flat coat with some feathering</p><p>Coat Color: Red with white markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Happy, energetic, intelligent, playful, trainable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Wales</p><h2>Characteristics of the Welsh Springer Spaniel</h2><p>The Welsh springer spaniel is known for being hard-working, energetic, enthusiastic, and affectionate. While they generally get along very well with other pets, these dogs are people-orientated. They're a great choice for families with children, and thanks to their amiable personalities, they also welcome strangers as new friends.</p><p>Welsh springer spaniels were bred to hunt with their owners, and this companionable temperament is still present in the breed today. This also means that these dogs aren't suited for homes with owners that leave the house often. They don't do well on their own, and as true ""velcro dogs,"" they form strong bonds with their families. If you're prepared for an active pet that wants to join you on adventures, the Welsh springer spaniel might just be the perfect match.</p><h2>History of the Welsh Springer Spaniel</h2><p>It is thought that most spaniels are descendants of ancient hunting spaniels bred on the Iberian Peninsula. As this region is home to Spain, these breeds earned their name from the word ""Spaniard."" The Welsh springer spaniel is recognized as the oldest British spaniel according to the AKC.</p><p>While springer types can be traced back as far as the 16th century in the United Kingdom, records for the red and white variety specific to Wales began in the 18th century. During this time, they were popular with nobility and gentry and prized for their enthusiastic hunting skills. They were bred to spring upwards, pushing birds higher to be trapped in nets (before the use of guns became common). They have great scenting abilities, and their webbed feet make them strong swimmers that can also retrieve birds from the water.</p><p>The emerging English springer spaniel overtook the Welsh breed in popularity by the 19th century. In 1902, the Kennel Club in the U.K. formally recognized both spaniels as two separate breeds. Welsh springer spaniels were first imported to the United States in the late 19th century, then recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1906.</p><p>Not as popular as some of their other Spaniel relatives, World Wars I and II took a toll on Welsh springer spaniel breeding programs. Their population dropped drastically. It was thought that none remained in the United States after World War II, and it was only after more dogs were imported that passionate enthusiasts were able to revive the breed.</p><p>While their numbers have increased, Welsh springer spaniels are still relatively rare, especially in comparison to their English cousins (despite the Welsh breed being more laid-back).</p><h2>Welsh Springer Spaniel Care</h2><p>Welsh springer spaniels are loving family dogs, but they require significant exercise and training to be well-mannered companions. Since their coats are long and silky, it's also important for owners to keep up with their grooming needs to prevent tangles.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Welsh springer spaniels are very active, and they are best suited to households that enjoy lots of outdoor exercise. This energetic breed needs to be active for at least two hours per day. They can make great competitors in dog sports, and they are strong runners and swimmers. Making sure your dog has appropriate alternative forms of stimulation (like a designated digging sandpit or puzzle toys) can be especially beneficial.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Welsh springer spaniels are moderate shedders, and their coats will need a brush out at least once a week. If you keep the feathering around their legs and tummies longer, then you may need to brush them out more frequently. This is an important step to help prevent tangles. When the coat does become tangled or matted, use a detangling spray and comb it out with your fingers before following up with a brush.</p><p>Like other dog breeds, Welsh springer spaniels will also need to have their teeth brushed, nails trimmed, and ears checked for any buildups of dirt and debris to prevent infections. If the ears need cleaning, use a cotton ball and cleaning solution specified for the ears.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training Welsh springer spaniels with basic obedience lessons when these puppies are about eight weeks old. Since they have plenty of energy and enjoy pleasing their owners, training can be a fun process for both owner and dog. Your intelligent Welsh springer spaniel will respond very well to positive reinforcement methods rather than punishment.</p><p>This breed is known for alert barking, so owners may find it helpful to reward good behavior when the dog quiets down and directs its attention away from barking. Welsh springer spaniels also retain their hunting instincts, meaning they need consistent training for a reliable recall and should not be allowed off-leash outside of a fence.</p><p>If this breed hasn't been properly socialized, it may be a little reserved around strangers at first. Thankfully, the friendly nature of these dogs makes it easy to get them accustomed to social situations. Once your dog has become comfortable with different people, it's likely to welcome strangers going forward.</p><p>Welsh springer spaniels generally have a gentle temperament and can be great companions to respectful children. However, they are known for their exuberance and tendency to become overexcited. Working on training to stop jumping and keep all four paws on the floor is a great way to prevent young children from being knocked over.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Welsh springer spaniel is known to be a generally healthy dog, but like most purebreds, it is still susceptible to a few problems. Responsible breeders will perform health screenings on prospective parents to reduce the risk of puppies developing inheritable conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Welsh springer spaniel high-quality dog food twice per day. The specific food your dog should eat depends on its age, as its nutritional needs will change over time. It's also important to monitor portions and treats, as these food-motivated dogs are likely to gain weight or become obese otherwise. Talk to your veterinarian to determine a healthy meal plan and portion sizes based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Welsh Springer Spaniel</h2><p>Since the Welsh springer spaniel is a relatively uncommon breed in the United States, prospective owners may not have much luck finding these dogs in shelters. Check out breed-specific rescues to give a Welsh springer spaniel a forever home, or visit your local shelter to adopt a similar breed that can be your next best friend.</p>",1194

This breed is the epitome of a hard-working livestock dog. Highly trainable and extremely intelligent, Belgian Sheepdogs were designed to perform a job but they also have a sensitive, gentle temperament that craves human companionship, making them ideal family dogs.</p><p>A strong-willed breed, the Belgian Sheepdog is often referred to as ""bright-eyed and bushy-tailed."" They are exceptionally loyal, tending to be workaholics who aim to please. These shepherds always give their all when participating in any sort of activity, whether it be working a farm or simply playing in the backyard with their favorite humans.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 75 pounds (males); 45 to 60 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Thick double coat with a dense undercoat and coarse outercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Black</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, loyal, protective, intelligent, active</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Belgium</p><h2>Characteristics of the Belgian Shepherd</h2><p>These eager, athletic dogs have high energy levels and require plenty of daily exercise. Belgian Sheepdogs are a great match for active families that plan to take their dog along on hikes, bike rides, runs, or any type of outdoor adventure. When it comes to children, these dogs have especially loving and protective personalities. Belgian Sheepdogs get along well with other pets, but their instincts may lead them to herd smaller animals or young kids around the house. Thankfully, this intelligent breed is easily trainable and can learn appropriate behaviors quickly with guidance from its owners.</p><h2>History of the Belgian Sheepdog</h2><p>Belgium's terrain and climate are ideal for both livestock and dairy farming. Belgian farmers were once focused on cattle, and breeding herding dogs was an essential part of farm life. In fact, there were once eight varieties of shepherds unique to Belgium. These dogs were officially classified for the first time in the 1890s. Today, the remaining breeds include the Belgian Sheepdog (also known as the Groenendael or Chien de Berger Belge), Tervuren, Malinois, and Laekenois. These dogs are all anatomically identical, but with coats that vary in terms of texture, color, and length.</p><p>The Belgian Sheepdog is the solid-colored (black), long-haired variety. The name Groenendael was given to these dogs by a man named Nicolas Rose, a renowned breeder of the time who operated a restaurant near Brussels called the Chateau Groenendael. In fact, Rose is thought to have purchased the foundation couple that began the Belgian Sheepdog breed.</p><p>The Belgian Sheepdog was listed in the Chien de Berger de Races Continentales (Continental Shepherds), a group that also includes German Shepherds, Briards, Hollander Herders, Bouviers, and Beauceron. In the late 1800s, efforts were made to propagate a Belgian dog for nationalistic purposes. The Club du Chien de Berger Belge, or Belgian Shepherd Club, was created and ultimately led to the Belgian Sheepdog's development.</p><p>By the turn of the 20th century, Belgian Sheepdogs became well-known for their versatility and hard-working nature outside of Belgium. Both Paris and New York relied on the breed as police dogs in this era, and they were often employed by customs agents to help identify smugglers. During World War I, they worked as ambulance dogs, messengers, and freighters of heavy gunnery, then went on to serve as war dogs during World War II.</p><p>The Belgian Sheepdog Club of America was formed in 1949, and since that time, the breed has worked as police and service dogs, competed in dog shows, and performed search-and-rescue work. Alongside their jobs, Belgian Sheepdogs have also become known as loving, loyal family pets.</p><h2>Belgian Sheepdog Care</h2><p>While the Belgian Sheepdog is typically easy to train, this dog needs considerable exercise every day to keep up with its high energy level. Owners should also prepare for routine grooming and two heavy shedding seasons each year.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like other herding breeds, the Belgian Sheepdog needs a sufficient amount of exercise for up to two hours each day. These dogs do not enjoy lounging around the house; they are alert, active workers that thrive when given a job to do. Belgian Sheepdogs also crave time with their humans, so as an owner, it's essential to exercise with your dog.</p><p>Rather than letting this breed roam around the backyard by itself, great ways to provide physical and mental stimulation include games of fetch or practicing new tricks. The Belgian Sheepdog isn't an optimal choice for owners that work long hours outside the home. This breed is likely to become bored and possibly destructive in the house, and it can also develop separation anxiety. Sheepdog owners should also keep safety in mind, as these dogs are hardwired to chase sheep, so they won't hesitate to take off after animals, joggers and cyclists, or even cars so leashed walks and fenced yards are must-haves.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>When it comes to coat maintenance, the Belgian Sheepdog's double coat which consists of a dense undercoat and a coarser outer coat is easier to maintain than you might think. However, it has a heavy shedding season once to twice each year that requires daily brushing to remove excess fur. Weekly brushings are sufficient during the rest of the year, along with occasional baths.</p><p>Like other dog breeds, you should also routinely trim your dog's nails, brush their teeth, and check their ears for dirt and debris buildup. Clean the ears as needed with an ear cleaner made specifically for dogs.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Along with participating in daily exercises with your Belgian Sheepdog, it's also important to start training this breed early. Basic obedience lessons can begin when puppies are about eight weeks of age. Further training should continue throughout the dog's life with consistency and positive reinforcement. Methods involving punishment are not recommended, as they can be harmful to your dog's sensitive personality and bring out their strong-willed nature.</p><p>Thanks to their intelligence, Belgian Sheepdogs excel at advanced training like agility sports, obedience competitions, tracking, and herding. They're eager to please their owners, and they do best when training is kept positive and fun. Reward your dog with treats and affection for desired behaviors.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Belgian Sheepdog is a sturdy, robust breed that is generally healthy. Like other purebreds, it is still prone to a few inherited medical problems. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards and test parent dogs before breeding. The Belgian Sheepdog Club of America notes that these dogs can be particularly sensitive to anesthesia, so your veterinarian should take precautions should the need for surgery ever arise.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Belgian Sheepdog</h2><p>Like other shepherd breeds from Belgium, the Belgian Sheepdog requires a serious commitment from its owners to be a well-mannered and happy companion. These dogs can end up in shelters when their families are not prepared for the time and dedication they require. If you're interested in adopting a Belgian Sheepdog, contact your local shelter to find rescue dogs and breed-specific rescues within your region.</p><p>When adopting a Belgian Sheepdog as a puppy, it's essential to do your research and work with a responsible breeder. You should be provided with the litter's family medical history, allowed to meet their parents, and able to see that the dogs are raised in a comfortable indoor location. Belgian Sheepdog puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $3,000, but prices may be higher or lower depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Belgian Sheepdog Overview</h2><p>Intelligent, easily trainable</p><p>Loyal and affectionate with family</p><p>Hardworking, up for any activity</p><p>Very high exercise needs</p><p>Prone to separation anxiety</p><p>Can become destructive if left alone</p>",1242
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bolognese-dog-breed-profile-4589303,Dogs > Dog Breeds,<h1>Bolognese (Bolo): Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Bolognese (Bolo): Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The Bolognese (also known as Bolo) is a toy Italian dog with small eyes, floppy ears, and a unique curly, ruffled white coat that grows upward on the top of the head. More than just another fluffy white lap dog, this breed is known for its especially calm demeanor. Bolognese dogs are affectionate toward their owners, and they enjoy being around people so much that they're prone to separation anxiety when left alone.</p><p>The Bolognese might remind you of the Bichon Frise, and with good reason-they're closely related and are sometimes called the Bichon Bolognese. These dogs are also cousins to the Maltese, Havanese, Coton de Tulear, and Lowchen. While they aren't suited to all types of families, if you're looking for a companion to stay loyally by your side, the Bolognese might be just right for you.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy (AKC Foundation Stock Service)</p><p>Height: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long, cotton-like curly coat</p><p>Coat Color: White</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Playful, even-tempered, loyal, docile, serious</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bolognese</h2><p>The serene Bolognese can be a wonderful family pet, known for its docile personality and loving nature toward humans. As a companion dog in the truest form, this breed chooses its favorite human and wants to be close to them in every moment. Bolos also get along with other dogs and enjoy playtime whenever it's available. However, for owners that aren't active throughout the day, this breed's laid-back temperament also makes it content to stay inside and relax.</p><p>The Bolognese may not be suited to all households with young children-with its small frame, this dog can easily become overwhelmed by bursts of affection from an enthusiastic child. But when children know how to interact with the dog respectfully, the Bolo is happy to coexist and play together.</p><h2>History of the Bolognese</h2><p>Descended from Bichons, the Bolognese dog originated in Bologna, Italy in the 11th century. The breed was loved by nobility and was a frequent gift between noble families during the Renaissance (particularly between Italian and Belgian royalty). When nobility started to die out, the breed almost went extinct.</p><p>It wasn't until the 1980s that an Italian breeder named Gian Franco Giannelli, along with a few other European breeders, helped to restore the Bolognese to its present-day popularity. The breed was brought to England, where it was first shown in Imported Register classes in 1990. Bolos have been showing at the Crufts dog show since 2002. The breed isn't registered with the AKC yet, but it can still be recorded for breeding and competition purposes.</p><h2>Bolognese Care</h2><p>Like all dog breeds, the Bolognese requires some mental engagement and physical exercise every day, but these dogs are usually easygoing. They need to be moderately active and require basic training to stay happy and well-mannered. In the grooming department, Bolos are known for being a bit high-maintenance thanks to their long, curly coats.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bolognese dogs aren't bred to be athletes, and they're generally satisfied with running around the backyard or going on leashed walks. Exercising for about 30 minutes once to twice per day should be plenty to keep this breed fit. These dogs are recommended for owners that are home often and able to provide them with plenty of attention, and playtime at the house is a great way to keep your Bolognese active and engaged without overexertion.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Like many other long-haired dogs, the Bolognese requires significant grooming. Some owners prefer to keep this breed's coat trimmed short to prevent the need for daily brushing, but haircuts will be necessary often to maintain a short length.</p><p>If you let your Bolo's hair grow out, plan to brush the coat every day to avoid matting and odor. Since these dogs don't shed profusely, they're a good option for owners with mild to moderate allergies, but long white hairs will still shed around the house in small amounts. Along with caring for the coat, owners should also brush this dog's teeth, trim its nails, and check its ears for dirt and buildup. Clean the ears and brush the teeth on a regular basis to prevent infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Bolognese can begin basic obedience training in puppyhood at about eight weeks of age. This intelligent breed tends to pick up on training quickly, but owners should keep lessons interesting. Use positive reinforcement methods in short sessions, offering rewards like treats, affection, and playtime for desirable behavior.</p><p>Because of their tendency to develop separation anxiety, these dogs are not suitable for people who work outside of the house full-time. Owners should be sure to provide them with plenty of puzzle toys and other methods of entertainment whenever they are left alone. Bolos are usually quite friendly, though, and can thrive in a doggie daycare that has a good setup for small dogs. This is a good option while owners are on vacation or away for the day every so often, but it isn't best for a full-time plan.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>As a relatively rare breed, Bolos are usually healthy without inherited medical problems. Though their gene pool is small, it's mostly maintained by very dedicated breeders. Before purchasing a Bolognese puppy, ask the breeder for proof of a patella exam and CERF (eye) exams at a minimum.</p><p>It's important to research responsible breeders who do extensive health testing for their puppies. Proper breeding practices include more than just taking the parents and the puppies to the vet; routine exams don't always catch genetic diseases. By receiving clear test results and clean bills of health for the litter's parents, you'll help increase the chances of your Bolognese living a long, healthy life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all dog breeds, your Bolognese should be fed high-quality dog food appropriate for its nutritional needs at different stages of life. Small-breed formulas are recommended, but your veterinarian can help you narrow down the best options and create a healthy portion plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><p>Keep an eye on your dog's weight and avoid overfeeding, which can cause health problems down the road. Use your hands to check for a healthy weight-since these dogs have thick coats, it can be hard to see their waistlines. Feel for the hipbones and ribcage, ensuring that you can reach them without digging through any fat (and that they aren't sticking out, either). If your dog becomes overweight, consult your veterinarian about the best options to reach healthy goals. Exercising and playing more often, feeding fewer treats, and using puzzle feeders are all helpful ways to help your dog burn some energy.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bolognese</h2><p>Before you bring home a new dog, explore similar breeds to compare their personalities and care requirements.

The breed is said to be as magnificent and alert as a lion. Used in Tibet for thousands of years as powerful and imposing estate guardians, today's Tibetan mastiff retains its protective instincts, watching over its home and family with endless tenacity. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 24 to 26 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 70 to 150 pounds</p><p>COAT: Double outer coat is fine but hard, straight, and stand-off; undercoat is heavy, soft, and woolly</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, brown, blue/grey, or gold</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, protective, strong-willed, tenacious, aloof</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: China (Tibet)</p><h2>Characteristics of the Tibetan Mastiff</h2><p>In the right hands, the Tibetan mastiff breed provides unparalleled loyalty, devotion, and protection to its family. The breed's guarding instincts are heightened at night, and many dogs of this type can bark loudly and excessively in the evening hours. It's best to keep your mastiff indoors at night to avoid bothering your neighbors. Make sure you have a secure fence to keep your dog from roaming day or night.</p><p>Some Tibetan mastiffs are aggressive towards other dogs and must be kept away from strange dogs. In the same household, keeping dogs of the opposite sex tends to have better outcomes than owning two males or two females.</p><h2>History of the Tibetan Mastiff</h2><p>Due to the isolation of its country of origin and a lack of written breeding records, the Tibetan mastiff's history is shrouded in mystery. We do know that the Tibetan mastiff is an ancient breed that has existed in Central Asia for thousands of years. The Tibetan mastiff breed was first introduced to the Western world in 1847 when it was brought to England and entered into The Kennel Club's first studbook. More than 100 years later, the breed finally made its way to the United States in the 1950s. The American Tibetan Mastiff Association, which is the national club for the breed in the U.S., formed in 1974, and the breed received full recognition with the American Kennel Club in 2006. </p><p>It was not unheard of to pay upward of $200,000 for a Tibetan mastiff puppy in China in the early to mid-2000s when it was a must-have dog for the status-conscious. Today, the dog is no longer popular overseas where certain areas of China have abandoned and banned the breed.</p><h2>Tibetan Mastiff Care</h2><p>The Tibetan mastiff requires special care and handling. Early, intensive socialization is mandatory with the Tibetan mastiff. An improperly socialized Tibetan mastiff has the potential to grow into a liability. Introduce your Tibetan mastiff puppy to as many people, places, animals, and things as possible, keeping interactions positive, and going at the dog's pace.</p><p>Even with careful socialization, some Tibetan mastiffs find it difficult to accept strangers or strange animals, especially those entering the dog's property. Many Tibetan mastiffs, especially those that receive adequate socialization, are far more relaxed and accepting of strangers when off their own property. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As with all large and giant breeds, exercise for puppies and young adults must be approached with caution. Due to the Tibetan mastiff's large frame and hefty weight, and predisposition to hereditary joint conditions like hip dysplasia, repetitive exercise like jogging or jumping should be limited and/or avoided completely until the dog is at least two years old and fully mature. Even a fully mature Tibetan mastiff is not going to be a jogging partner or agility champion, although most enjoy daily leisurely walks totaling between 30 to 60 minutes. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Tibetan mastiffs are surprisingly easy to groom. The profuse coat sheds very little outside of one seasonal shed (typically in spring or summer) where they blow coat, losing almost all of their undercoat in just a few weeks. During this heavy shed, frequent brushing and a bath or two can help, but expect hair everywhere. The rest of the year, the coat sheds very little and requires just weekly brushing and bathing when the dog becomes dirty. </p><p>In addition to coat care and bathing, your dog needs regular tooth brushing and nail trimming.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Although Tibetan mastiffs are extremely intelligent and capable of quickly learning basic obedience skills, they can also be stubborn and not particularly inclined to always do what you ask. Training should be started at an early age and rules should be enforced consistently throughout the dog's lifetime. Because the Tibetan mastiff is physically large and naturally suspicious of strangers, it is vital that any Tibetan mastiff owner be capable of physically restraining their dog when necessary, whether in public or at home. </p><p>Even with intensive socialization (which is an absolute must with this breed), the Tibetan mastiff can be difficult to train. Massive and powerful, the breed's protective instincts are so heightened that some Tibetan mastiffs may not always listen when their owners say a visitor is allowed and not an intruder to be vanquished.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Tibetan mastiff, like many purebred dogs, is prone to certain genetic conditions. Responsible breeders test their adult dogs prior to breeding them to avoid passing on inherited diseases. The American Tibetan Mastiff Association (ATMA) requires (or recommends depending on the condition) all member breeders to perform certain health tests on all dogs prior to breeding them, as listed below.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feeding your Tibetan mastiff may prove tricky. Despite their enormous size, many Tibetan mastiffs don't have huge appetites, and eat far less than you might assume. Some Tibetan mastiffs even go on food strikes, refusing to eat for days at a time. For these reasons, it's especially important to feed your pup high-quality dog food (consult with your breeder or veterinarian for a recommendation).</p><p>Pay attention to how much your Tibetan mastiff is eating so you know how much your dog is consuming and whether it's on a food strike. If your Tibetan mastiff happens to have a healthy appetite, avoid overfeeding. Free feeding can lead to weight gain, which puts stress on the joints and can contribute to health issues. Feeding measured meals allows you to track how much your Tibetan mastiff is eating, whether it's too much, too little, or just right.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy</h2><p>The Tibetan mastiff is one that requires an experienced dog owner. Anyone considering a Tibetan mastiff should reach out to a reputable breeder to talk about what's it's like to live with the breed. Some adult Tibetan mastiffs might find themselves in rescue on occasion. More often though, anyone searching for a Tibetan mastiff will need to track down a reputable breeder and get on a waitlist (often a long waitlist) for a puppy. Expect to pay between $1,500 to $5,000 for a purebred Tibetan mastiff.</p><h2>Tibetan Mastiff Overview</h2><p>Exceptional guard dog</p><p>Doesn't require a lot of exercise</p><p>Sheds very little outside of the seasonal shedding in spring or summer</p><p>May be difficult to train</p><p>Highly territorial; requires intensive socialization</p><p>May be aggressive with other dogs, especially strange dogs on their property </p>",1153

Originally bred for bird hunting, Irish setters have become prized for their beauty, friendliness, and work ethic. They adapt well to life with children and other pets but do have a natural prey drive, so you'll need to watch them with small animals.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 27 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 60 to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium length with feathering on ears, chest, legs, and tail</p><p>COAT COLOR: Red, copper</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, intelligent, athletic, gentle, sweet-tempered</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Ireland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Irish Setter</h2><p>Irish setters are the quintessential family dog, with a sweet and playful temperament that make them ideal companions for owners of any age. They are highly intelligent and easy to train, whether you want to participate in a sport alongside them or just want them to remain safely in your yard. They typically get along great with other pets and often make friends (human and otherwise) wherever they go.</p><h2>History of the Irish Setter</h2><p>Despite its red coat, the Irish setter hails from the Emerald Isle. This dog breed was developed in Ireland to assist bird hunters before the advent of firearms. Setters are a group of dog breeds that use their keen sense of smell to detect birds and ""set""-or take a low stance with their body nearly touching the ground. When the bird is flushed from its hiding spot, the hunter makes the shot and the dogs eagerly retrieve the fowl.</p><p>Bird hunters in Ireland were searching for a bird dog that would move swiftly over the rather open terrain of the Irish countryside but retain the attentive and patient demeanor of prized hunting companions. In the early 1800s, hunters looked to spaniels, English setters, and Gordon setters in order to breed an eager, attentive, and quick bird dog.</p><p>The result was a red-and-white setter-type dog that became known as the Irish setter. Over time, further breeding resulted in a dog with an exclusively red coat with no patches of white. Today, a coat with traces of black is considered a fault in the breed's appearance, though it isn't a disqualifying factor for show dogs. The rich red of the Irish setter's coat is equally eye-catching in the field or walking down the street.</p><p>With such striking good looks and an eager-to-please temperament, it's no surprise that these dogs quickly began spreading across Britain and into the United States. While the Irish setter only appeared on the scene at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup>-century, this breed was one of the first nine breeds to gain early AKC-recognition in 1878. Along with the English setter and Gordon setter, the Irish setter was well on its way to becoming a popular dog breed in the United States for hunting and companionship.</p><p>Red setters, as they're sometimes called by breed enthusiasts, developed into two sub-types: field and show. Show-type setters are the most common and represent the mental picture that most people have of an Irish setter-thick, flowing red coat, heavy bones, tall stature with long legs and body. The field-type setter has been intentionally bred to retain its working abilities and has the same characteristically red or mahogany coat, but features significantly less feathering, finer bones, and a more compact stature.</p><p>What both types share is a strong drive to work and please their owners. Today, the Irish setter excels in the field, show ring, and family room. This breed has had the distinction of winning the Westminster Kennel Club's Sporting Group competition 11 times. Irish setters rank within the top 100 most popular dog breeds in the United States.</p><h2>Irish Setter Care</h2><p>Caring for an Irish setter is a rewarding experience. This dog breed is loyal and affectionate, but also has a playful side that delights owners young and old alike. It could be said that these dogs have never met a stranger; they seem to warmly welcome everyone, so it goes without saying that an Irish setter doesn't make a suitable watchdog.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>To help this sporting dog maintain a balanced, happy disposition, you'll need to plan on at least an hour of vigorous activity each day. These dogs love a brisk walk, going for a run, or endlessly retrieving tennis balls. Ideally, a fenced yard gives this breed a safe place to roam and romp, but it won't replace the need for a daily walk or run.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Caring for the Irish setter's gorgeous red coat isn't as time-consuming as you may think. Their coat will benefit from a couple of brushing sessions per week, as well as an occasional bath, but it's relatively low-maintenance despite its flowing appearance.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>An affable nature doesn't mean that training an Irish setter is a hands-off experience. Like all dog breeds, this breed requires a consistent and positive approach to training. If you start with your setter in puppyhood, be sure to provide plenty of socialization with people of all ages and animals large and small. Keep in mind that the setter was born to flush game, so their prey drive can sometimes be activated by smaller household pets. However, this tendency can often be molded and contained with good, consistent training.</p><p>Red setters are very intelligent and quick learners. Aside from being a natural fit for field trials, they do well in fly ball, dock diving, canine agility, and obedience. Their attentive nature and calm demeanor also make them well-qualified as therapy or service dogs. However, the breed's natural affinity for human companionship means that they can be prone to separation anxiety. Compared to some other dog breeds, they don't tolerate being alone for extended periods of time particularly well.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The hearty Irish setter is a resilient breed and isn't known for having frequent health complications. However, like most purebred dog breeds, there are some inherent conditions to be on the watch for.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Keep your red setter in tip-top shape with quality dog food. This active breed will do well with a protein-rich formula that provides plenty of fuel for field activities or a daily romp in the dog park.</p><p>It's important that you don't let the Irish setter gulp down its food too fast, since this breed can be prone to bloat. Canine bloat can become a life-threatening condition. Some people have had good success using slow-feeder dog bowls or feeding smaller, more frequent meals.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Irish Setter</h2><p>If you're starting your search for an Irish setter, consider first checking with rescue groups in your area or region. Irish setter rescues exist that specialize in finding new homes for these beautiful dogs. If you have your heart set on an Irish setter puppy, there are plenty of breeders as well. Just be sure to find an Irish setter breeder that breeds for quality and health. It's always a good practice to meet at least one, if not both, of the puppy's parents.</p><h2>Irish Setter Overview</h2><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Very tolerant with children and other dogs</p><p>Highly intelligent and eager to please</p><p>May chase smaller pets</p><p>Can develop separation anxiety</p><p>Prone to bloat and some inherited health problems</p>",1189

The Cat Fanciers Association does not recognize the lynx-point pattern in Siamese; only solid-colored points in four colors (seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac) are permitted in the CFA breed standard. </p><p>The CFA and the Canadian Cat Association both recognize a separate breed, called the Colorpoint Shorthair, which is essentially a Siamese with more allowable colors and patterns, including lynx point. So, if you are looking for a Lynx Point Siamese, consider searching for a Colorpoint Shorthair in the lynx point pattern. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>OTHER NAMES: Lynx Point Colorpoint Shorthair.</p><p>PERSONALITY: Amiable, gentle and dog-like.</p><p>WEIGHT: About 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>LENGTH: Up to 14 inches. </p><p>COAT LENGTH: Short, glossy, fine-textured and close-lying.</p><p>COAT COLOR: All colors have tabby (lynx) markings: blue, blue-cream, chocolate, chocolate tortie, cream, lilac, lilac-cream, red, seal and seal-tortie.</p><p>EYE COLOR: Vivid blue.</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 8 to 12 years.</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No.</p><p>ORIGIN: United States.</p><h2>Lynx Point Siamese Characteristics</h2><p>Like all Siamese, the lynx point Siamese is active, outgoing, affectionate, and curious. Siamese are some of the most intense Velcro cats, a nickname that refers to their need to be close to-often touching-their favorite humans. They want to be part of the action and will follow you all over the house to learn what's going on that day. Because they are so friendly, Lynx Point Siamese usually get along great with other household pets, including other cats and cat-friendly dogs. As is true with most Siamese and colorpoint shorthairs, the Lynx Point Siamese is an extremely vocal breed. If the cat is awake, it's likely to be chatting away with loud yowls and meows. Lynx Point Siamese are highly intelligent and can even be trained to do fun tricks. Try positive training methods, such as clicker training, and use plenty of yummy food rewards. </p><h2>History of the Lynx Point Siamese</h2><p>The Lynx Point Siamese was created in the U.S. sometime during the 1940s or 1950s when some breeders began experimenting with color in the Siamese breed. A red tabby American shorthair was bred to a seal point Siamese and a whole new world of color opened up for the Siamese breed. These new cats looked just like Siamese in all ways but color, coming in more than the four solid traditional Siamese colors. Some also featured patterns within the color points, including lynx point (tabby markings) and tortie point (tortoiseshell markings). </p><h2>Lynx Point Siamese Care </h2><p>The Lynx Point Siamese's coat is short, smooth, and easy to care for. The coat doesn't shed excessively. Brush weekly with a rubber curry brush, grooming mitt, or soft bristle brush to remove loose hair. Bathe these naturally clean cats occasionally to keep the coat soft and shiny. Trim your lynx point Siamese's nails weekly or every other week and check inside the ears every so often to look for any signs of dirt. If the ears look dirty, clean them with a pet ear cleanser and cotton ball or gauze square (never stick anything like a cotton swab into a cat's ear). If the ears look red, inflamed, or excessively dirty, or if you notice your Lynx Point Siamese shaking its head or scratching at its ears, schedule a checkup with your veterinarian to rule out ear mites or an ear infection.</p><p>Lynx Point Siamese are highly active. Help them get enough exercise by providing plenty of climbing opportunities, perches, and scratchers. Help ensure your Lynx Point Siamese scratches in the right places (and not your carpet or the sofa) by placing more than one scratcher of varying types. Some cats like vertical scratchers (such as posts or cat trees), others like horizontal scratchers that lie flat on the ground (like cardboard or sisal scratchers), and some cats enjoy scratching vertically and horizontally. It won't be hard to engage your Lynx Point Siamese in play sessions to burn off energy-this breed loves to play. Try a variety of toys, such as feather teasers or fishing pole toys, furry mice, jingle balls, interactive toys that move, and puzzle toys that the cat must manipulate to extract a treat. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Some purebred cats are more prone to developing certain genetically linked health issues. The Lynx Point Siamese is at risk for the same issues seen in the Siamese and the colorpoint shorthair, including crossed eyes and other eye issues, a liver disorder called amyloidosis, renal amyloidosis (a related disorder affecting the kidneys), dental problems, breathing issues, such as asthma and bronchial diseases, and congenital heart defects, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Lynx Point Siamese is very graceful and refined, muscular without being bulky, and very athletic. The breed is medium-sized with fine bones and a long, tubular body with tapering lines. The legs are long and well-muscled but finely boned. The rear legs are slightly taller than the front legs. One of the breed's trademark characteristics is its wedge-shaped head with flat forehead and fine muzzle. The Lynx Point Siamese's very large ears are wide at the base and continue the lines of the wedge. The medium-sized, almond-shaped eyes, which are always a deep, vivid blue, slant toward the long, straight nose. The short coat is tight, close-lying, fine textured, and glossy.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Lynx Point Siamese is lightly but muscularly built. This is an active breed that tends to get a lot of exercise if provided with enough engagement and opportunities to run, climb, and play. Though they are less likely to pack on the pounds compared to more sedentary breeds, it's a good idea to keep a close eye on your cat's weight to make sure they're staying lean. If you're not sure of your cat's ideal weight, ask your veterinarian. Keeping your Lynx Point Siamese lean may help to prevent the development of certain health issues, including diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Lynx Point Siamese </h2><p>Though the Siamese is a popular breed, Lynx Point Siamese are somewhat more challenging to find than Siamese of traditional colors. Your best bet is to search out an excellent breeder who breeds Siamese to the TICA breed standard, or someone who breeds colorpoint shorthair cats (CFA breed standard). The Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association publish lists of Siamese and colorpoint shorthair cat breeders on their websites. If you are rescue-minded, you might also be able to find an adult Lynx Point Siamese by searching animal shelters or breed-specific cat rescue groups. </p><h2>Lynx Point Siamese Overview</h2><p>The Lynx Point Siamese cat is a sociable, affectionate, and energetic companion. If you're looking for a cat to keep you company, look no further. This breed is unlikely to stray far from your side, happy to follow you around as you go about your day and trying to take part in every activity you do. They are so connected to their people that they simply don't do well when left alone all day. Some cat breeds are independent and content to sleep the day away while you're off at work or activities, but Lynx Point Siamese will get lonely if you aren't around a lot. If you must be away, consider a feline friend for your cat to cuddle and play with. This breed is extremely vocal, and though breed lovers adore the loud yowls and meows of the Lynx Point Siamese, not everyone appreciates such a loud cat.</p><p>Needs lots of attention</p><p>One of the loudest cat breeds</p><p>Doesn't do well when left alone for long periods of time</p>",1235

This dog is muscular with a smooth, dense coat in shades of russet. Known for their pointing and retrieving skills, they were prized and versatile hunters, often mistaken for pointers since they are both part of the sporting group and have physical similarities. Today, the vizsla has evolved as a popular, loving, beautiful, and active companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 22 to 24 inches (males); 21 to 23 inches (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 55 to 60 pounds (male); 44 to 55 pounds (female)</p><p>COAT: Smooth, short, and dense</p><p>COAT COLOR: Varying shades of golden rust in color</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, loyal, gentle, energetic</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Hungary</p><h2>Characteristics of the Vizsla</h2><p>Vizslas are exceptionally companionable and form strong bonds with their family members. They tend to be friendly with people and other dogs (and cats) in general and thrive in company. This does mean, however, that they can be prone to developing separation anxiety if left on their own too much and they are best suited to a household where they will have someone around most of the day.</p><h2>History of the Vizsla</h2><p>The vizsla has an ancient and noble heritage. It is believed that their origins can be traced as far back as the 8th century. It was during this time that the Magyar clans in Hungary were established and they needed dogs with stamina, speed, athleticism, and courage to aid them with their hunting. This is why they are often referred to as the Magyar or Hungarian vizsla.</p><p>There is even a piece of artwork dating back to the 10th century that features a Magyar tribesman, his falcon, and a dog that closely resembles the look of a vizsla.</p><p>As the centuries moved on, these dogs became prized possessions of Hungarian noblemen. They continued to refine the breed's hunting skills and temperament so that it more closely resembles the modern-day vizsla that has won the hearts of many.</p><p>By the late 19th century, the population of vizslas had dramatically declined, and they were on the verge of extinction. The dedication of breed enthusiasts meant it was able to escape this fate and the demand for this dog has since continued to grow again.</p><p>The first vizslas arrived in the United States in the mid 20th century, they gained recognition by the AKC in 1960, and they continue to be a popular breed in North America and Europe.</p><h2>Vizsla Care</h2><p>The vizsla is regarded as an adaptable, affectionate, and active breed. They are best suited to living in an active home that enjoys a consistent outdoor lifestyle that includes hiking, for example. They are very energetic and if they do not get enough daily exercise and stimulation, they can become easily bored and destructive in the home. In addition, they are known to be excellent chewers, so make sure you have lots of safe and interactive toys for them to engage with.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed excels in competitive sports and can make great agility dogs. Their hunting pointing and retrieval skills mean they also do well in scent work trials, and they are often great lovers of water. They are known for their stamina and athleticism and love to run, so you will often see advice from owners that this breed needs hours every day running around outdoors. A quick walk around the block will not be enough for a vizsla. However, this type of energy makes them a popular choice if you enjoy the sport of Canicross (running with your dog).</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Vizslas do not have a high maintenance grooming regime. They have a short coat that will only need brushing around once a week to lift out dead hair and keep the coat in good condition. They are not known for excessive shedding, either.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Vizslas are also intelligent and eager to please. Making sure you give them enough mental stimulation is important to prevent problem behaviors from surfacing. They respond extremely well to positive methods of dog training and, with the right, guidance, pick up commands and training cues very quickly.</p><p>They are quite a communicative breed and can be prone to alert barking, howling, and other vocalizations. You will need to make sure that you do not accidentally reinforce these behaviors as they can then become a problem. Always reward them for being quiet and ask for an alternative behavior to keep their barking under control.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Vizslas are known for being a generally healthy breed. They do have some health conditions that they can be more genetically predisposed towards.</p><p>Canine Epilepsy: Vizslas are more prone to epilepsy-related seizures than the average breed. There is ongoing research in this area. In the meantime, it is reassuring to know that, while there is currently no cure, it is a condition that can often be well managed with medication and lifestyle adaptations.</p><p>Auto-Immune Diseases: Vizslas are also recognized to be more prone to certain auto-immune diseases. Cases of seasonal and food allergies are more common. There is also a breed-specific condition that is currently being researched called vizsla inflammatory polymyopathy. Symptoms can include muscle wastage around the skull, problems swallowing, and excess drooling. If this is diagnosed early enough, the prognosis is normally good as it can be treated with immune suppressant drugs.</p><p>Hip Dysplasia: This is common amongst many breeds. It relates to the abnormal formation of one or both of the hip joints. It is usually a progressive condition and, in severe cases, surgery can be required to help maintain a good quality of life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, you should feed your vizsla a high-quality and properly portion-controlled diet.</p><p>Vizslas, with their deep chests, are recognized as being more at risk from the life-threatening condition referred to as bloat.</p><p>It is recommended that feeding them at least twice a day, rather than one large meal, can help to minimize the chance of this occurring. If they are prone to gulping their food down, encouraging them to eat more slowly from a slow feeder or interactive treat toy could also help.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Vizsla</h2><p>Whatever puppy you are planning to bring home, you should do your research and find a good breeder.</p><p>You should be able to see the puppies together with their mother in a nurturing home environment. They shouldn't be allowed to come home with you until they are at least eight weeks old.</p><p>Before searching for a vizsla, remember that the breed needs an owner willing to commit to intense playtime and attention every day. If you feel confident handling a vizsla, contacting the Vizsla Club of America could be a good place to start your research.</p><p>Don't rule out offering a vizsla a forever home through adoption. This can be a rewarding experience. The Vizsla Club of America is involved directly in breed rescue. There are also other breed-specific rescues across the country to reach out to, including New Hope Vizsla Rescue. Don't forget to check for the breed at your local rescue shelter.</p><p>If you buy from a breeder, expect a vizsla to be quite inexpensive, with prices ranging from $500 up to $1,700.</p><h2>Vizsla Overview</h2><p>Suited to owners leading an active lifestyle</p><p>Very affectionate</p><p>Intelligent and eager to please</p><p>High energy and needs a lot of stimulation</p><p>Not suited to a home where they are left alone too much</p><p>Can be prone to chewing and barking</p>",1214

For the right person, the Bouvier is a capable and intelligent dog that's up for any activity you want to plan together. Raising this breed properly can result in a long, happy, and fulfilling friendship.</p><h2>History of the Bouvier des Flandres</h2><p>The Bouvier des Flandres originated in Belgium, where it was developed as a multi-purpose farm dog during the late 19th century. Bouviers are believed to have been bred from Irish wolfhounds, Scottish deerhounds, and local farm dogs. They were used as drovers, draft animals, and protectors. The breed was known best as an excellent cattle herder, which is the meaning of the French word ""bouvier."" Nicknames for the breed included vuilbaard (dirty beard), koehond (cow dog), and toucheur de boeuf (cattle driver).</p><p>By the early 20th century, the Bouvier had grown in popularity. An official breed standard was established in 1912. World War I and the battlefields of Belgium nearly wiped the breed out, as the Bouvier was used for military purposes. Fortunately, some survived and enthusiasts repopulated the breed.</p><p>The Bouvier arrived in the United States in the late 1920s and was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1929. In Belgium, the title of a champion still requires that the dog has won a working dog competition.</p><h2>Bouvier de Flandres Care</h2><p>The Bouvier is usually easy to train, responding best when its owners use positive reinforcement and avoid methods involving punishment. Because of this dog's high energy level and long, shaggy coat, its exercise and grooming needs can be fairly time-consuming to stay healthy.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Bouvier may appear to be calm and laid back, but the breed still requires about an hour and a half of daily exercise. A fenced-in yard is best to give your dog plenty of space to run, but play sessions and walks are still very important.</p><p>Establish a daily routine of several different activities to provide both physical exercise and mental stimulation for your Bouvier. You might find that your dog's natural herding instincts kick in to herd you when you walk together. Along with regular forms of exercise, the Bouvier excels at canine sports like agility training. This is a great option to work your dog's mind and body at the same time.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Bouvier requires frequent and extensive grooming in order to keep its shaggy coat in good shape. Loose hairs are retained in the double coat and must be combed out. A lack of proper grooming can lead to serious matting (which may require trips to a professional groomer). Some owners prefer to keep the coat trimmed short, but you will need a groomer who knows the right way to trim this dog to get the appropriate look. Though the grooming demands of the Bouvier are high, a benefit of the coat type is that it sheds very little.</p><p>You'll find that this dog's coat naturally picks up debris from daily walks. Thus, owners will need to spend some time after each exercise session cleaning these dogs and any dirt that they track into the house.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Bouvier is driven and intelligent. Like most herding dogs, it possesses a strong prey drive. Therefore, the breed requires a solid foundation of obedience training and strict discipline. This is a very large dog that can be difficult to handle without proper training.</p><p>The Bouvier can make a wonderful pet for many kinds of households, but this breed is not for everyone. Use caution around cats and other smaller animals until you have a good idea of your Bouvier's prey drive. Bouviers will do best with smaller animals when they have been raised together.</p><p>This breed can get along well with children, but be aware that it may try to herd them (especially small children). In addition, young Bouviers may not realize their size and are prone to knocking over little kids. Consistent and structured training along with exercise is key.</p><p>A Bouvier needs interaction with its family, and it doesn't do well when left alone for long periods. Otherwise, your dog may develop behaviors like chewing and barking. Bouviers are also reserved around visitors and strangers. If not properly socialized, this breed may become overly protective or shy.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to develop hereditary conditions, but some hereditary health problems can still occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Bouviers should be fed two meals per day of high-quality dog food. You can also feed this dog several smaller meals per day or use a slow-feeder bowl to help prevent Bloat, but as a large breed, the Bouvier should not eat one large portion. Bouviers are prone to bloating and stomach torsion, which can happen if they gulp down their food quickly or eat too much at one time. This is a medical emergency.</p><p>Bouvier des Flandres puppies need a low-calorie diet to ensure they don't grow too fast, which can make them more prone to bone disorders. This breed is also known for odorous flatulence, so owners should be prepared for this before adoption.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bouvier des Flandres</h2><p>If you think the Bouvier des Flandres is right for you, it's helpful to do additional research before adopting one. Talk to other Bouvier des Flandres owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more. Since this is a rare dog breed, it's unlikely to find a Bouvier in shelters, but your local shelter may have similar dogs that are waiting for their forever homes.</p><p>When adopting a Bouvier as a puppy, finding a responsible breeder is essential. You should be provided with the litter's medical history, allowed to meet their parents, and able to see the conditions the dogs are kept in. Private breeders of Bouvier des Flandres dogs can be found around the country. These dogs tend to be quite expensive, especially when buying a purebred dog from an experienced breeder. Puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $2,500, but prices may be considerably higher depending on the litter's pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Bouvier des Flandres Overview</h2><p>Rare breed with a distinct look</p><p>Naturally driven and intelligent</p><p>Loyal companion</p><p>High-maintenance grooming needs</p><p>Strong prey drive</p><p>Requires a high level of physical and mental stimulation</p>",1257

One of the most popular hound dogs, Bassets are second only to Bloodhounds when it comes to their powerful sense of smell and tracking ability. This breed is easily identifiable thanks to its velvety ears, but it also stands out for its signature bay and charming, unique character.</p><p>Though they're known for being stubborn, Basset Hounds are also extremely devoted and loyal. They're typically mild-mannered and calm at home, which makes them excellent family dogs for the right owners. Training is notoriously challenging, but there's a reason this breed has such a devoted following. Filled with personality and spirited antics, the Basset Hound is as lovable at home as it is determined when following a scent.</p><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: Up to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth fur</p><p>Coat Color: Combinations of black, brown, tan, white, lemon, mahogany, and red</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Loving, stubborn, playful, sweet-tempered, friendly</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Basset Hound</h2><p>Along with their incredible sense of smell, Basset Hounds are also known to be exceptionally devoted to their families, affectionate, and playful. This breed has a patient temperament with children, other dogs, and even cats as long as it's properly socialized.</p><p>Basset Hounds were bred to work in packs, so this breed will be especially happy in the company of other canines. It also means they can be very playful and social, though their personalities will often be mild and low-key at home. Known for their love of snoozing on the couch, your Basset will be happy to come lounge inside after playing outdoors for any length of time. Although they're highly intelligent, Bassets tend to use this trait to their own advantage rather than obeying their owners' requests. With a little love and a lot of patience, however, they can become well-mannered dogs for a dedicated family.</p><h2>History of the Basset Hound</h2><p>Originally bred in France and Belgium, it's believed that Basset Hounds originated when friars of the Abbey of St. Hubert crossed strains of older French dog breeds to create a low-built scenthound. In fact, the word ""bas translates in French to low and even sometimes ""dwarf."" The plan was to breed a dog that could navigate rough terrain while being followed by a human hunting partner on foot as they tracked rabbits and deer. Because of their tracking accuracy, Bassets became a popular choice for French aristocrats that practiced hunting as a pastime.</p><p>The Basset Hound was first recognized in 1885 by the American Kennel Club (AKC), and it was only the organization's 10th established breed at the time. These dogs were presented as gifts by Lafayette, a French aristocrat and military officer who commanded American troops in several battles, after the conclusion of the American Revolutionary War. In 1935, the Basset Hound Club of America was organized in the United States.</p><h2>Basset Hound Care</h2><p>While Bassets need less exercise than many other hunting dogs, they require significant time and patience from their owners when it comes to training. These strong-willed and stubborn dogs are likely to ignore lessons in favor of play, treats, and other fun distractions. However, with consistency and positive rewards, your Basset can learn desirable behaviors at home. In the grooming department, this short-coated breed only needs routine care.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>They may not be the most athletic (or fastest) dogs, but that doesn't mean your Basset Hound won't require regular exercise. These hounds thrive with a routine that includes about 30 minutes to an hour of moderate daily exercise. Bassets are known for their endurance, and options like long walks are a great way to keep this breed active. They're also very playful, so running around in the backyard with toys and family members will likely become a favorite activity. Not only will exercise help keep your Basset healthy, but it can also help prevent weight gain, which these food-motivated dogs are especially prone to.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Though they have short hair, Basset Hounds require regular grooming sessions. They're also known for being profuse shedders. To decrease shedding and keep your dog's skin healthy, plan for once-weekly brushings with a soft brush or shedding tool. It's also important to include occasional baths as necessary when your Basset's coat becomes noticeably dirty.</p><p>Like all dog breeds, Basset Hounds also need to have their nails trimmed and teeth brushed regularly. Another regular grooming step is essential for this breed: checking their ears for dirt and buildup. Floppy-eared dogs are more prone to ear infections than others, and the Basset's particularly long ears hold in moisture at high rates. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Bassets are considered a highly independent, stubborn dog breed, which means that training them isn't always easy. Basic obedience lessons should begin early-when puppies are as young as eight weeks old-and will need to be reinforced several times per day.</p><p>Over time, Bassets and other scenthounds were bred to hunt on their own, which means they had to follow a track without getting distracted. As a result, they're still mostly interested in following their own desires. Training will require extra time, patience, and consistency, as Basset Hounds will often appear aloof and disinterested in following the commands of their owners. This breed will respond well to treats (offered in moderation) and positive praise during training sessions. Avoid methods involving punishment, which can make Bassets resist training further. Like all dogs, they should also be properly socialized from an early age.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Basset Hound is generally a healthy breed, but like most purebreds, it's still susceptible to certain inherited health issues. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards by testing parent dogs for genetic conditions prior to breeding. Always ask your breeder to provide the litter's medical history when adopting a puppy.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Basset Hound should perform well with high-quality commercially or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times. As with all breeds, treats should be given in moderation and their diet should be controlled in order to avoid weight gain or obesity-related issues. Since Bassets are especially prone to weight gain, it's best to talk to your veterinarian to determine a healthy diet and portion plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Basset Hound</h2><p>Like many other hound breeds, Bassets can end up in shelters when owners aren't prepared for their specific care needs. These dogs are especially vocal (opting to bay, or howl, instead of barking) and they're known for being stubborn. Talk to other Basset Hound owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more before adopting this breed. If you're certain the Basset is right for you, start your search by checking your local shelter and breed-specific rescues for Basset Hounds in need of forever homes.</p><p>If you plan to adopt from a breeder, it's essential to do your research. Find a responsible breeder that readily provides you with the litter's medical history, introduces you to the parent dogs, and shows you that they're raised in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Basset Hound puppies typically cost between $600 and $1,500 from breeders, but prices may be higher depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Basset Hound Overview</h2><p>Mild-tempered and charming</p><p>Loyal and devoted</p><p>Great with children and other pets</p><p>Can be stubborn and difficult to train</p><p>High shedding coats</p><p>Prone to ear infections</p>",1233

Prized for its strength and heart, this breed is popular among families and active individuals. Alaskan Malamutes were originally bred for diverse tasks needed in their native region like hunting polar bears and pulling heavy sleds.</p><p>It's a common misnomer that Alaskan Malamutes are the result of wolf-dog hybrid breeding. While the breed we recognize today may have wolf ancestry, these dogs have been bred and kept in the North American tundra for centuries. And despite their immense size and stature, they're friendly and people-oriented-making them good family dogs, but poor guard dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches (males); 22 to 24 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 85 pounds (males); 75 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Thick double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Solid white or combinations of white and gray, seal, red, black, or silver</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, loyal, playful, affectionate, bright, courageous</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Alaska</p><h2>Characteristics of the Alaskan Malamute</h2><p>A supersized dog requires a major investment of time and TLC, but the Alaskan Malamute will reward you as a lovable member of your family with a loyal temperament. These dogs are pack animals that require a strong leader. When well-trained and given the necessary commitment by their owners, Malamutes are incredibly affectionate and filled with playful personality traits (though like their smaller Siberian husky cousins, they can also be stubborn).</p><p>One thing that might surprise you about the Alaskan Malamute is that they don't make great guard dogs. This breed has a naturally friendly nature that leads them to greet most strangers as friends rather than foes. Of course, their intimidating size might be deterrent enough to would-be intruders.</p><h2>History of the Alaskan Malamute</h2><p>The history of the Alaskan Malamute starts in the far north, and it's a classic example of the synergy that can exist between man and animal trying to survive in the harshest conditions. The breed we know today was originally developed by the Mahlemiut Inuit tribe in northwestern Alaska.</p><p>While it's believed that the breed may have been developed with wolf lineage many generations back, the Malamute is a domesticated dog that has been bred by the Mahlemiut tribe for centuries. These dogs were used by the indigenous people of northwestern Alaska to pull heavy sleds in teams, on hunting expedition trips for seals and polar bears, or as decoys when bear hunting. Their versatile history is centered around working, which made steadiness and strength the breed's strong points. This is in contrast to the smaller Siberian husky, which was bred for speed when traveling long distances while pulling sleds.</p><p>Variants of the Malamute breed developed in arctic regions spanning from Alaska to Greenland. In the 1920s, an interest in competitive sled dog racing led to the further breeding and development of these dogs. However, only one variant of the Malamute-the Kotzebue-received early AKC recognition in 1935.</p><p>Despite its suitability for a wide range of tasks, the breed was in serious decline after World War II. In fact, some sources estimate that the Malamute had a population of only 30 in 1947. To ensure its viability, the AKC expanded the breed's recognition to include the Hinman and M'Loot strains. Today's polar dogs are the result of domesticated breeding, and while they're majestic and wonderful creatures, their bloodline is pure dog (not part-wolf).</p><p>The Alaskan Malamute is widely exhibited at international dog show events, including the Westminster Kennel Club and the Crufts Dog Show in England. They compete in the working group, and their dignified manner and large size are a commanding presence when they step into the ring.</p><h2>Alaskan Malamute Care</h2><p>Considering their size and strength, it's important that you provide clear, firm leadership for an Alaskan Malamute. This breed also requires considerable grooming and physical activity to live a happy and healthy life.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Alaskan Malamute has significant exercise needs since it was bred to work. A large yard with room to expend energy can help keep these dogs active and well-balanced, however, it is not enough to satisfy their needs.</p><p>Malamutes benefit from structured exercise. The options for stimulating and tiring activities are abundant with these strong, hardworking dogs. In suitable climates, they're a great choice for hiking and backpacking, running, or even swimming with their owners. If you're looking for more advanced options, your Malamute can also be trained for agility sports, weight-pulling competitions, or pulling you on a bike or skis (known as bikejoring or skijoring).</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>One of the biggest challenges with this breed might be its extensive shedding. Outfitted with a thick, waterproof double coat, these dogs have a lot of hair. Be prepared to give your dog a thorough brushing at least several times a week, though some people recommend daily brushing (and vacuuming) to keep fur flurries under control.</p><p>Malamutes shed their undercoat twice a year in both spring and fall. During this period of heavy shedding, you'll need to brush your dog every day and use an undercoat rake to keep stray fur from taking over your home.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Without proper obedience training, the dominant nature of these dogs can cause them to push around other pets. Occasionally, they can be known to be forceful with children, but the vast majority of Alaskan Malamute owners find their dogs to be patient and loyal with young kids. The best course of action is to make obedience training a priority from puppyhood to raise a dog that respects and listens to you as it grows larger and stronger.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Alaskan Malamute is relatively healthy. Like most purebreds, it has a few genetic health conditions to be aware of, along with others related to the immense size of this breed. Testing is available for certain major concerns. Evaluations recommended by the National Breed Club include the hips, eyes, and a polyneuropathy DNA test. Reputable breeders should provide clear test results for the parents of each litter.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>For years of health and happiness, feed your Alaskan Malamute a quality diet. These dogs can be prone to overeating or developing Bloat from gulping down their food too quickly, so it's recommended to feed several smaller meals per day rather than one to two larger portions.</p><p>Speak with your veterinarian to plan a consistent diet and portion schedule based on your Malamute's age, weight, and activity level. This is an important step to help your dog avoid excessive weight gain or canine obesity, which can lead to other health problems.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Alaskan Malamute</h2><p>National and regional rescue organizations are available to help Alaskan Malamutes find their forever homes. Puppies and adult dogs alike end up in need of loving owners, and a rescue can be a great place to find your new best friend.</p><p>There is also a devoted community that is committed to raising and showing Alaskan Malamutes, and many reputable breeders exist in North America. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,500, but some can cost upwards of $6,000 depending on their pedigree.</p><h2>Alaskan Malamute Overview</h2><p>Friendly and outgoing with people</p><p>Enjoys outdoor activities like hiking and biking</p><p>Intelligent and loyal nature</p><p>Excessive shedding</p><p>Can become dominant with other pets</p><p>Needs significant exercise and mental stimulation</p>",1207

These colossal dogs were developed on farms in Brazil where they were utilized as guard dogs, cattle herders, and to track, chase, catch, and hold large animals like jaguars until the hunter arrived.</p><p>Most dog breeds have flat, level toplines. Some breeds like Afghan Hounds and Whippets have arched toplines. In contrast, the Fila Brasileiro's croup, also called the rump or buttocks, is higher than its withers at the top of the shoulders.</p><p>These skilled protectors are not the breed for everyone. The best situation for a Fila is rural living on a substantial property. A Fila will not be happy with city life or even in the suburbs. If you enjoy an active social life and like to invite people over to your home frequently, the Fila is not the breed for you. But with the right owner, the Fila Brasileiro is nearly unmatched for its loyalty and devotion to its human family. In fact, the breed even sparked a saying in Brazil: Faithful as a Fila.&rdquo;</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Molossoid breeds, Mastiff type (FCI)</p><p>Height: 26 to 30 inches (males); 24 to 28 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 140 to 180 pounds (males); 130 to 160 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth, dense fur</p><p>Coat Color: Brindle, fawn, and black; with or without black markings on the face</p><p>Life Span: 9 to 11 years</p><p>Temperament: Reserved, protective, fearless, active, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Brazil</p><h2>Characteristics of the Fila Brasileiro</h2><p>Courageous, determined, and self-assured, the Fila Brasileiro is docile and devoted when it comes to their human family, including children. It's important for owners to teach their kids how to respectfully interact with this breed. A Fila wants to be right where you are, and the dog will seek you out if it loses track of you.</p><p>Naturally aloof with strangers, this dog has an extremely protective temperament when it comes to its people and property. Filas have a high prey drive and cannot be trusted with cats and small dogs. They may be able to coexist peacefully with other family dogs if brought up together, but bringing a new dog into the mix once a Fila has been established in the family is not advised.</p><h2>History of the Fila Brasileiro</h2><p>The origin of the Fila Brasileiro is not entirely clear. One theory suggests that breeds in the Fila's background may include the Mastiff, the Bloodhound, and a type of bulldog that existed in the 1400s. This bulldog breed was much larger and more aggressive than today's short, docile version.</p><p>We do know that the Fila Brasileiro was developed centuries ago in Brazil. The breed's discerning protectiveness made it a prized protector and property guardian. Its strength and bravery allowed it to herd, track, and capture large prey like jaguars. In Portuguese, the word filar means to seize, and that's exactly what these dogs would do-grip the animal by the neck and pin it down, holding it until the hunter could catch up.</p><p>The Fila Brasileiro is not recognized by any major kennel clubs in North America (the American Kennel Club, Canadian Kennel Club, and the United Kennel Club). It is recognized in Brazil by the Confedera&ccedil;&atilde;o Brasileira de Cinofilia (CBKC), in Puerto Rico by the Federacion Canofila de Puerto Rico (FCPR), and internationally by the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI).</p><h2>Fila Brasileiro Care</h2><p>Along with its massive size, the Fila Brasileiro comes with some hefty care requirements to stay happy and well-behaved. These dogs need plenty of physical activity and training, but in the grooming department, their short coats are relatively low-maintenance.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Fila Brasileiro is a giant dog with considerable exercise needs. These athletic, strong canines do best when given at least an hour of activity each day. Filas are energetic, needing both physical exercise and mental stimulation to be content. They are excellent working and farm dogs, and they thrive when they have a job to do. Since they shouldn't be allowed near animals they aren't familiar with, it's best to take this breed for long runs and walks in rural areas. Filas also enjoy chasing toys, using puzzle toys that reward them with treats, and playing games with their owners that challenge their minds.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Fila Brasileiro has a short, smooth, and low-maintenance coat. This breed sheds moderately year-round, but owners can manage shedding by keeping up with regular brushings a few times each week to remove loose fur. Bathe Filas as needed when their coats become dirty from spending time outside.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Fila is powerful and strong-willed, and it needs a handler who can lead with authority and consistency. Although Fila Brasileiros are extremely intelligent and capable of learning complex tasks, they can be headstrong and tricky to train. Basic obedience lessons should begin early when puppies are about eight weeks old.</p><p>Proper training methods must be used. There is no forcing a Fila to do anything. Positive, reward-based training can work well, but keep sessions short and avoid too much repetition to prevent losing your Fila's interest.</p><p>Due to the breed's pronounced wariness of strangers, early and intensive socialization is paramount to avoid raising a dog that won't accept strangers. Even with consistent socialization starting in puppyhood, the Fila will rarely be content to sit back and relax with strangers coming and going. This breed requires an owner with experience handling guardian breeds who can be a firm but fair leader. In the right hands, however, the Fila is exceptionally devoted and a brave protector.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like most purebred dogs, the Fila Brasileiro is prone to some genetically inherited health issues. Reputable breeders will test their adult dogs prior to breeding to prevent passing problems down to puppies. Ask your breeder to provide the litter's medical history along with any available test results for genetic conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Filas can weigh more than 100 pounds, so they eat a large volume of food. The more active your Fila is, the more it will need to eat. However, it's important to avoid overfeeding. Excess weight puts a strain on the body and joints, contributing to health problems like hip and elbow dysplasia, as well as other issues like diabetes.</p><p>Feed measured meals to avoid weight gain. Since this breed is prone to Bloat, it's important to feed smaller portions several times per day (at least twice) to prevent your dog from eating too much too quickly. Ask your veterinarian to help you determine a healthy diet plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Fila Brasileiro</h2><p>Finding a Fila Brasileiro in the United States may prove difficult, as it is an extremely rare dog breed that's not recognized by any major North American kennel clubs. To adopt a similar dog in need of a forever home, reach out to your local shelter and meet breeds like the Fila that can join your family.</p><p>Those who are driven to pursue ownership of a Fila might look to breeders in countries other than the United States and Canada. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000 from breeders. Regardless, keep in mind that the Fila Brasileiro is not a good breed choice for the vast majority of dog owners.</p><h2>Fila Brasileiro Overview</h2><p>Extremely loyal</p><p>Protective of its home and family</p><p>Determined working dog</p><p>Requires a very experienced owner</p><p>Needs extensive socialization</p><p>Should live in rural homes away from neighbors</p>",1238

The first time you see this adorable dog, you might mistake it for a doodle or another mixed breed, but the Otterhound is actually a breed all its own. It's believed that these dogs date back to medieval times in England when they were prized for their otter-hunting skills. Today, these large and lovable hounds are full of energy and always ready for fun.</p><p>Otterhounds were raised to hunt in large packs of dogs. Since squabbles among packmates would interfere with getting the job done, Otterhounds were bred to be even-tempered. These dogs typically get along well with everyone-including kids, strangers, other dogs, and even cats-and are especially affectionate toward their family members. Although Otterhounds are loving and happy-go-lucky, they're also strong. Their boisterous nature could lead to them inadvertently knocking over small children, so carefully supervise all kid-and-dog interactions involving this breed. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 24 to 27 inches tall</p><p>Weight: 80 to 115 pounds</p><p>Coat: Dense, rough, coarse topcoat; Short, wooly, slightly oily undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, gray, tan, wheaten, black and tan, liver and tan, blue and cream</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, bright, energetic, even-tempered, boisterous</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Otterhound</h2><p>Since they're such a friendly breed, Otterhounds make great family dogs and companions for active households. Their play-driven temperament is a good match for older kids, and their high energy level makes them a great dog for active owners who want to bring their pup along on hikes, bike rides, and runs; however, they should not be allowed off-leash. Their hunting instincts can override even the best obedience training, and like all hound dogs, the desire to follow their noses can get them in trouble. As long as your Otterhound is safely kept on a leash or in a fenced-in yard (assuming the fence is tall enough), this dog can quickly become your best friend thanks to its lovable, silly personality.</p><h2>History of the Otterhound</h2><p>In 18th-century England, hunting with hounds was a big pastime. Although fox hunting was the most popular at the time, otter hunting was also common. It was born of necessity as river otters decimated fish populations, which were a valuable food source for humans. Otter hunting, like fox hunting, eventually became prevalent as a sport. Noblemen and royalty, including Queen Elizabeth I, raised Otterhounds. Otter hunting was banned in England in the 1970s because otter populations were severely depleted.</p><p>Today's Otterhound is thought to have a variety of breeds in its background, including Bloodhounds and various shaggy French hounds. The Otterhound is very rare. According to the Otterhound Club of America, there are fewer than 1,000 Otterhounds in the entire world; most of them are in the United Kingdom and the United States.</p><h2>Otterhound Care</h2><p>While it's a very desirable dog for the right owner, the Otterhound can be a bit high-maintenance when it comes to care. This breed needs plenty of exercise along with consistent training to be its best. Grooming requires a bit more than some other hound breeds, but thankfully, its signature shaggy coat doesn't need to be trimmed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Otterhound needs plenty of exercise to stay happy and well-behaved at home. The younger an Otterhound is, the more exercise it needs, but at least an hour per day is a good starting point. Reserve extensive exercise for when your dog turns two years old to allow its bones and joints to develop fully. After that, long walks, hikes, and jogging are great options, along with swimming and playing fetch in safe, enclosed areas.</p><p>Otterhounds should never be allowed to roam freely. They tend to follow their noses when they catch a scent, turning a deaf ear to your calls and blind eye to dangerous situations like traffic. Always keep your dog safely on a leash or inside a privacy fence, as this breed is prone to jump-and its large size means it can easily bound over shorter fences.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Otterhound's medium-length, tousled coat is a trademark feature of the breed. It doesn't require trimming, but weekly thorough brushing is necessary to keep the coat from matting and to cut down on shedding (but luckily, they shed only moderately). Otterhounds have an oily, waterproof undercoat. While it's a major bonus for swimming, it can also lead to a greasy-feeling outercoat and doggie scents. Some Otterhounds have more oil than others; how often they need to be bathed depends on how the coat looks, feels, and smells.</p><p>The shaggy beard collects water and food, and it can also develop an odor if not kept clean. The attentive owner should dry the beard frequently and wash it during regular baths. The Otterhound's big, hairy paws may also track in dirt and mud, so it can be worthwhile to keep a towel handy near the door to wipe them down before coming inside. Trim the nails weekly and clean the ears with a pet-safe ear cleaner as needed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Otterhounds can be challenging to train, so it's best for owners to start basic obedience training young (around eight weeks of age). This is not because they aren't smart-you just need to figure out what motivates yours.</p><p>Otterhounds have sensitive personalities, so gentle methods like clicker training and positive reinforcement work best. Otterhounds respond best to praise and especially food rewards. Start training your dog young before it grows large and strong enough to pull you off your feet. Keep sessions short and upbeat, and provide lots of consistency in what you expect of your Otterhound. With enough friendly encouragement, your dog will grow up to be well-behaved and happy.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Otterhound is fairly healthy, but like most purebred dogs, is predisposed to developing certain hereditary health conditions. Responsible breeders will test their dogs for hip dysplasia and GT before breeding to avoid passing on problems. When buying an Otterhound puppy from a breeder, be sure to ask for paperwork confirming these tests were performed on the parents. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Otterhound on a schedule (morning and evening for adults) and measure out precise amounts of high-quality dog food with a measuring cup or scale. Since this is a large-breed dog, it's important to avoid overfeeding. This can cause Bloat, and over time, canine weight gain can contribute to hip dysplasia.</p><p>Talk with your veterinarian to determine a healthy eating schedule based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Otterhound</h2><p>Otterhounds are great family dogs. They can be a little messy, so they might not be the best breed for the clean freaks, but if you can live with a little mud, hair, and drool, the clownish Otterhound will make you laugh and be your constant companion.</p><p>Since the Otterhound is such a rare dog breed, it's not common to find one in shelters. However, breed-specific rescues are a great place to find Otterhounds in need of their forever homes. Many similar hound breeds can also be found in local shelters, so consider meeting the dogs in your area to find your new best friend.</p><h2>Otterhound Overview</h2><p>Lovable and affectionate</p><p>Gets along with children and other pets</p><p>Great companion for active families</p><p>Needs considerable exercise and training</p><p>Grooming must be consistent to prevent doggie smells</p><p>Rare breed that is hard to find</p>",1210

The compact size and friendly nature of these sporting dogs have made them a reliable companion for duck hunters for centuries, but today they're masters of canine competitions and loveable family dogs.</p><p>Don't let the long name put you off from getting to know this unique dog breed-many people refer to these dogs as Kooikers for short. The Kooiker makes for a low-maintenance and alert family companion, but they can have a sensitive nature and be wary of strangers. One of the Kooiker's most notable features are the long black hairs adorning their ears. Often referred to as ""earrings,"" this feathering is a desirable trait in Kooikers. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 15 to 17 inches tall</p><p>Weight: 20 to 35 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium length straight coat with feathered ears, legs, and tail</p><p>Coat Color: White with patches of color ranging from orange to deep red.</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, intelligent, energetic, loyal, active, bright</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Netherlands</p><h2>Characteristics of the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje</h2><p>Perhaps one of the lesser-known members of the sporting group, Kooikers are personality-packed, faithful, good-natured, and confident, making them excellent companions for a young and active family. They're up for an adventure any day of the week and love to be put to work with a ""job"" that keeps them mentally and physically stimulated. While they're often wary of strangers at the start, they make fast friends and will likely do well in homes with other pets.</p><h2>History of the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje</h2><p>One look at the Kooiker and it's clear that this sporting dog is of spaniel origin. To understand how Kooikers came to be, it's important to first look at the history of Dutch waterfowl hunting. In the Netherlands, where the Kooiker hails from, it was common practice to create man-made duck decoy ponds, referred to as ""eendenkooi,"" to lure in waterfowl.</p><p>Hunters, known as kooikers, would use this pond network to make bird populations more accessible and trap entire flocks. The Kooikerhondje seamlessly fit into the hunt by remaining a patient and alert hunting companion, capable of luring waterfowl in with its plumed tail and playful antics. The name Kooikerhondje was an obvious choice in Dutch, literally meaning the ""kooiker's dog.""</p><p>While it's easy to understand how Kooikers became a part of Dutch life, it's more unclear as to when this breed first appeared on the scene. Dogs bearing a direct resemblance to the modern Kooiker are clearly seen in paintings from Dutch artists like Rembrandt, Jan Steen, and Vermeer from the 17<sup>th</sup>century. Clearly, these dogs have been in existence since at least this early era, with some estimating they date back to the Middle Ages.</p><p>Organized breed development didn't begin until Kooikers were nearly extinct in the late 1930s. A decline in traditional hunting methods-plus the extreme socioeconomic pressures of World War II-caused the numbers of this Dutch dog to dwindle. The survival of the breed is credited to Baronesse von Hardenbroek van Ammerstol, who launched a search for Kooikers in 1939. She found one Kooiker-type dog, named Tommy, in the northern part of the Netherlands and, through careful breeding with similar dogs, the Baronesse was able to launch a successful Kooikerhondje kennel, named Walhalla, that remained in operation until 1976.</p><p>In 1971, the Dutch Raad van Beheer (similar to the AKC) granted recognition to the Kooikerhondje breed. The breed prospered from the dedicated efforts of breeders and the spotlight of showing and competition. However, the first Kooikerhondje litter wasn't born in the United States until 1999, making the breed a relative newcomer to the States. In 2004, the AKC accepted the Nederlandse Kooikerhondje into its Foundation Stock Service. Then, in 2018, the breed received full AKC recognition.</p><p>It's commonly accepted that the Kooikerhondje was a pivotal part of the breed development of the Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever. Physical features, such as the plumed tail, and behavioral traits like tolling, point to the Kooikerhondje's influence on this Canadian sporting dog.</p><h2>Nederlandse Kooikerhondje Care</h2><p>A true sporting dog, the Kooikerhondje has a pleasant and easy-going temperament in the home and a determined, driven attitude in the field. These dogs are known for being tireless workers that remain vigilant and in sync with their handlers. In the home, this attentive spirit makes them loyal family dogs-though their sensitive nature means they might be easily affected by harsh mannerisms and rough handling.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>For a truly happy and healthy Kooiker, make sure your dog gets a healthy dose of daily exercise. Though they're generally adaptable and enjoy a leisurely stroll, they do need vigorous activity and mental stimulation. Aside from walking, running, and hiking, Kooikers often excel at dock diving, flyball, and agility.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This breed's feathered coat and plumed tail might make you think that these dogs are high-maintenance when it comes to grooming-however, enthusiasts of the breed point out that the opposite is generally true. Their medium-length fine hair resists snarling, which was a practical consideration in the dog's early days as a hunting companion that had to negotiate brush and bramble. Their coat is also water-resistant and doesn't become dirty quickly. Give your dog a weekly brushing and an occasional bath and his beautiful silky coat will stay in tip-top shape.</p><p>Like most dogs, it's important to maintain other aspects of your Kooiker's appearance. You should clean their ears regularly, keeping an eye out for any unusual redness or secretions. Their nails should be trimmed at least once a month-if you don't feel confident cutting their nails on your own, you can take your dog to a groomer instead. You should also help your dog maintain good oral hygiene by brushing its teeth at least a couple of times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like many other spaniel-type dog breeds, the Kooiker benefits from having clear pack leadership. If a leadership void exists, the Kooiker will easily rise to the occasion and can turn dominant and strong-willed. Frequent and ongoing training will reinforce your dog's pack position and help him or her to feel secure in the household.<br /><br />While not watchdogs per se, the Kooiker can be wary of strangers. To overcome this shyness, it's advisable to introduce your dog to new faces and situations early and often, including frequent guests at home and trips to the dog park. This will help your dog to become well-adjusted and adaptable.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Nederlandse Kooikerhondje is a reasonably hearty breed, with a longer lifespan than many other medium-sized canines. However, the limited gene pool at the start of the 20th century likely contributed to some of the breed's tendencies toward certain health problems.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Kooiker a balanced, high-quality diet with their long-term health and happiness in mind as a priority. Generally speaking, Kooikers will do well with two proportioned meals per day. Like all dogs, Kooikers love a treat but these should be kept in check. If you are unsure what or how much to feed your pet, ask your vet for advice.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Nederlandse Kooikerhondje</h2><p>Despite the breed's relatively recent arrival to the United States, a significant network of Kooiker enthusiasts exists. Among the Kooiker community are reputable breeders that are committed to the health and legacy of the breed. While it may be possible to find a Kooiker in a shelter or with a rescue league, few rescues exist dedicated solely to this rare breed.</p><h2>Nederlandse Kooikerhondje Overview</h2><p>Not overly excitable; easy-going</p><p>Low-maintenance coat</p><p>Petite size for an active breed</p><p>Limited breeders in the US</p><p>Strong prey drive</p><p>Shy around strangers without proper socialization</p>",1254

It's known for its lamb-like tufted face, pear-shaped head, curly coat, and gracefully arched back. Bedlington terriers are named for the mining town in England where they first originated. Today, these English dogs make charming family companions, but while they are lovable (and cuddly!) they are also alert watchdogs and versatile athletes that are fiercely protective of their loved ones.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>WEIGHT: 17 to 23 pounds</p><p>HEIGHT: 15.5 to 17.5 inches</p><p>COAT: Mixture of hard and soft hair, crisp but not wiry</p><p>COAT COLOR: Blue, sandy, or liver, sometimes combined with tan</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 16 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Good-tempered, affectionate, intelligent, spirited</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bedlington Terrier</h2><p>Overall, these charming dogs are lots of fun and love nothing more than to be their family's center of attention. These well-balanced, gentle dogs are known to be fiercely protective of their loved ones; that's why they make great watchdogs, though they are generally fairly friendly with strangers. The Bedlington makes an ideal dog for an active family seeking a non-shedding, playful, and loyal companion.</p><h2>History of the Bedlington Terrier</h2><p>A one-of-a-kind, lamb-like breed, the Bedlington terrier is said to have been bred from sighthounds like the whippet due to its arched back, speed, and agility. It is also believed to share common ancestry with breeds such as the Dandie Dinmont, Kerry blue, and soft-coated wheaten terriers. They move with a graceful, springy step, but can run incredibly fast when the situation warrants.</p><p>Though they resemble gentle lambs, the Bedlington has actually been responsible for performing some tough-and often deadly-work throughout its history. Bred in the 1800s, these brave, energetic dogs were created in the Northumberland mining shire of Bedlington as a working man's dog. The Bedlington was a prized hunting dog of animals such as foxes, hares, and badgers, and they were also expected to be a vermin hunter by the miners of Bedlington.</p><p>The very first Bedlington terrier was a dog named Piper. Bred in 1825, it has been said that Piper was still hunting badgers at age 14, even though he was nearly blind and had no teeth. At that time, the Bedlington was considered to be the smartest and fastest of all terrier breeds.</p><p>The breed acquired the nickname Gypsy Dog because it was often used by the wandering Romanies as a sneaky partner in their poaching activities. The Gypsy Dog was recognized by Lord Rothbury of Bedlington who became such an enthusiast of the breed that the terriers were often called Rothbury's terrier-and, sometimes, even Rothbury's lamb.</p><p>The nail makers of Bedlington also took a fancy to the breed, and it wasn't long before the shire's miners and nailers began betting their salaries in dogfights, in which they would pit their terriers against each other. They discovered that despite their lamb-like appearance, the Bedlington terrier would become ferocious fighters and would not back down when challenged. Sadly, they would fight to the death when forced into these circumstances. While miners exploited its gameness as a fighting dog, hunters were relying on Bedlingtons as retrievers.</p><p>The good news is that Bedlingtons turned out to be more of a sweetheart than a fighter. These charming dogs eventually rose from coal mines and nail factories to become welcomed into manor houses, where British elites would raise their Bedlingtons to be both lovable companions as well as attractive decorations as part of their lavish, stylish lifestyles.</p><p>England's National Bedlington Terrier Club was formed in 1877, and less than 10 years later, the American Kennel Club (AKC) registered its first Bedlington. Those who live in Bedlington, England are still proud of this famous export; Bedlington's Northern League soccer team is called the Terriers, and the town installed park benches shaped like the breed.</p><h2>Bedlington Terrier Care</h2><p>Bedlington dogs are lithe, energetic, and require a lot of exercise. They do tend to bark a lot and can become high-strung without ample exercise and mental stimulation. While this breed is energetic, they are not particularly rambunctious or mischievous.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Since it's a terrier, the Bedlington possesses a great deal of energy and will require regular exercise for the benefit of both its physical and mental well-being. The Bedlington prefers a brisk daily walk of at least 30 minutes, but sporadic bouts of more vigorous exercise throughout the week will keep your dog happy. This breed loves to play a round of fetch, go on a long walk or run, and it loves the water for a swim, but afterwards it's more than happy to curl up on the couch with its family. Many of these dogs enjoy participating in sports and competitions such as agility, tracking, and obedience.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The crisp hair of their coat is a mix of both soft and harsh (but not wiry) hair, and many Bedlington owners are pleasantly surprised to learn that these dogs don't shed very much, if at all. However, their hair does grow very quickly, and will need to be groomed approximately every two months-they can be groomed at home with the help of both electric clippers and scissors or taken to a professional groomer. Their coat will also need to be brushed and/or combed once or twice a week.</p><p>As with all dogs, Bedlingtons need basic grooming, including having their nails trimmed often, teeth brushed daily, and ears checked and cleaned regularly. The breed's ears are unique in shape and hair distribution, and need to be trimmed, as well, to neaten up the ear tassels.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like most terriers, the Bedlington terrier can be stubborn yet intelligent and eager to please, so early training and socialization should be high on the agenda. This breed will not respond to harsh training methods or physical correction, as it is more likely to lead to a battle of wills with its owner. Instead, training should be performed by owners who are not passive and are willing to remain firm and consistent while relying on positive-reinforcement techniques, such as offering praise and food as rewards.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Bedlington terrier should thrive on either a commercially-prepared or home-prepared (with veterinary supervision), high-quality dog food. Like many dogs, they can become overweight, so calorie consumption and weight should always be closely monitored by a veterinarian. It's also important that this active dog has access to clean, fresh water at all times.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bedlington Terrier</h2><p>Bedlington terriers are rare, so it may be difficult to find this dog breed in a rescue situation. But you should always be sure to check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for Bedlington terriers that are in need of a forever home. The national rescue group for Bedlington terriers, the Bedlington Terrier Club of America, can also provide online resources to help you find your new best friend.</p><p>If your heart is set on finding a Bedlington, you can try locating a breeder. The Bedlington Terrier Club of America and the AKC Marketplace are your best guides towards finding breeders. Expect to pay a breeder on average $2,500 for a purebred Bedlington terrier puppy, depending on the dog's lineage.</p><h2>Bedlington Terrier Overview</h2><p>Gentle and great with kids</p><p>Great watchdogs</p><p>Loves to cuddle</p><p>Requires a lot of exercise</p><p>Not suited for apartments</p><p>Coat requires higher-maintenance grooming</p>",1209

Though it's known for its low body, and slightly bowed limbs, the dog is recognized by its short snout, large eyes, and obvious V-shaped facial wrinkle. This compact, stocky dog is also famous for its lion's mane"" of long hair.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: Up to 14 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, thick double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Typically variations of gold, red, or sable, but occasionally colors including black and tan, white, cream, sable, and gray</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Opinionated, aggressive, stubborn, affectionate, intelligent, good-natured</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: China</p><h2>Characteristics of the Pekingese</h2><p>A Pekingese is an independent and alert toy dog and a charming lapdog companion. This breed is stronger and braver than its compact appearance might suggest. Among the favorite characteristics of the Pekingese is its friendly, social, and affectionate personality-and the fact that it can appear so dignified, opinionated, and walk with a seemingly effortless rolling gait. However, it has an assertive side to its personality.</p><h2>History of the Pekingese</h2><p>The Pekingese is one of several compact breeds that were created for the ruling classes of ancient China. In fact, a Chinese legend says the Pekingese was actually created by the Buddha when he shrunk a lion down to the size of a small dog. Another bit of folklore states that in order for a lion to wed his beloved-who happened to be a marmoset, or type of monkey-he had to beg the patron saint of animals, Ah Chu, to reduce him to the size of a pigmy while still retaining the heart and character of a lion. The offspring of that union was said to be the dog of Fu Lin, or the Lion Dog of China. Throughout history, the Pekingese have been referred to as lion dogs, sun dogs, and even sleeve dogs, since they were often toted around in the voluminous sleeves worn by members of the imperial household.</p><p>Because of the ancient history and folklore surrounding the breed, its true beginnings are still unknown, but experts believe that the Pekingese was likely bred down to toy size from a larger dog by Chinese emperors. The earliest-known record of the breed can be traced back to the eighth-century Tang Dynasty. Their humans have historically known these regal, sophisticated dogs to be eternally loyal and walk with a dignified gait.</p><p>Chinese nobles were known to breed flat-faced lapdogs for many centuries, including Pekes as well as the shih tzu and pug. The original Pekingese were kept completely pure and considered sacred-stealing one of these coveted regal dogs would result in a punishment by death. Treated as royalty, the dogs even had palace servants to tend to their every need-which may be why today's Pekingese can often have an independent, stubborn, and self-important demeanor.</p><p>It wasn't until the 1860s when Pekes first made their debut in the western half of the world. When British troops invaded Peking during the Opium Wars, the royal family opted to kill their Pekes when the Brits stormed the emperor's summer palace. The British intended to loot the palace and set it on fire, and the royal family didn't want to see their beloved pets fall into enemy hands. However, when a British captain discovered the emperor's aunt dead by suicide, her five surviving Pekingese dogs were returned to England as a gift for Queen Victoria. The breed quickly grew in popularity among the Queen's subjects, and ownership of a Pekingese dog became a sign of privilege and wealth across the country.</p><p>In 1894, a dog named Pekin Peter was reportedly the first Pekingese to be exhibited at a British dog show; at the time, the breed was often called a Chinese pug or a Pekingese spaniel.</p><p>As the year 1900 approached, Pekes were starting to arrive in America-they were originally registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1906, and the Pekingese Club of America first became an KC member in 1909. The breed made headlines a few years later when a Pekingese was one of only three dogs to survive the sinking of the Titanic.</p><h2>Pekingese Care</h2><p>A Peke is always very alert and aware of its surroundings, and can make a great watchdog. Early socialization will also be necessary in order to ensure that your Peke will get along with other pets in the household, as this is a breed that prefers to be surrounded by the company of humans (and other Pekingese).</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed does enjoy participating in games and canine sports, but only at its own pace. A Peke's walks should be kept at a leisurely pace to prevent overheating or difficulty breathing. Plan on a couple of walks a day that add up to about 30 to 60 minutes total.</p><p>Because of the Peke's thick coat and flat face, it tends to prefer cooler temperatures. Heat prostration can be fatal for this breed, so it's crucial that the Pekingese is kept in well-ventilated, air-conditioned rooms when living in warmer climates. Walks and outdoor playtime should be kept very limited when it's excessively hot.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>A Peke's coat requires a fair amount of maintenance. Longest at the neck and shoulders, the thick double coat of the Pekingese will require at least one lengthier weekly brushing to help remove hairs and prevent matting. Your Peke will also appreciate an occasional bath. Owners can also choose to keep their Peke's coat trimmed short to ease the burden of grooming. Pekingese do shed seasonally, and mats or tangles should be worked out gently. As with every dog, trim nails regularly, stay on top of dental care by frequently brushing its teeth, and consistently clean your pet's ears to avoid infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Because Pekes lived in palaces for centuries, they can be serenely independent, just like the emperors who owned them. As a result, training these dogs can sometimes be a challenge. Many Pekingese will consider themselves in charge, so Peke owners will have to persuade their dogs to follow commands. Not surprisingly, this breed responds best to positive reinforcement. Harsh approaches to discipline can lead to a Peke's defensive or even aggressive behavior.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The breed is also associated with some minor health problems that revolve around food allergies to ingredients like corn, wheat, filler, ash, and sometimes chicken. This flat-faced breed may also suffer gastrointestinal problems because it inhales a lot of air while eating. However, Pekingese should perform well with any high-quality dog food. As a less active breed, Pekinese can be susceptible to weight gain, so it's important to ensure they are not overfed and aren't offered too many treats. Fresh, cool water should always be available, particularly because this breed does not tolerate heat well.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pekingese</h2><p>Pekingese is a popular dog breed. It's always best to check your local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a Peke in need of a home. If you choose to work with a reputable breeder, the costs can vary widely, but expect to pay around $1,500 but more likely $4,000 to $5,000 per Peke pup.

As a working breed, Mudis are agile and intelligent dogs that can serve as versatile farm dogs and loyal protectors of their families. These alert, powerful canines are courageous enough to herd the most stubborn livestock while standing guard over their homes without an overly aggressive nature. The multi-talented Mudi is a hard worker that still makes a gentle, loyal family companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Weight: 18 to 29 pounds</p><p>Height: 15 to 18.5 inches</p><p>Coat: Short and straight on the face and the front of legs, wavy to curly throughout the body</p><p>Coat Color: Black, brown, gray, gray-brown, white, yellow, or merle</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, courageous, intelligent, active, bright</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Hungary</p><h2>Characteristics of the Mudi</h2><p>The Mudi is an energetic dog that does best with active families or homes that can provide a job for it to do. Whether you're working a farm or practicing agility training in the backyard, this dog is always up for new activities. Thanks to its intelligent personality and eagerness to please its owners, the Mudi is easily trainable and picks up on obedience lessons quickly. These dogs are also very affectionate with both adults and children, and they have a friendly temperament with other animals when raised together.</p><h2>History of the Mudi</h2><p>The Mudi dog has been around since the 19th century. The original name for Hungarians, the Magyars, began keeping sheepdogs around the end of the 9th century. At that time, the breed was only grouped into two categories-large or small-as pedigree breeding and the classification of dogs didn't start until the second half of the 19th century.</p><p>It's believed that the breed evolved from crosses of the Puli, Pumi, and German Spitz breeds. When breeding, the small dogs were typically divided from the larger ones and interbred. The Mudi shares its early history with both the Pumi and the Puli.</p><p>Sometime around 1930, Dr. Desz&ouml; F&eacute;nyesi, a director of the museum in Balassagyarmat, was one of the first to breed the small Mudi sheepdog separately. He is credited for naming the breed, which was officially recognized in 1936.</p><p>World War II severely impacted several Hungarian breeds. Some almost disappeared, and the Mudi was already rare. In the 1960s, its population was rehabilitated, and a few years later a new breed standard was written by Dr. Zoltan Balassy when applying for FCI recognition. This accepted different sizes and colors. The new standard was approved in 1966, but few remained interested in breeding Mudi dogs.</p><p>The restoration of the breed continued over the next few decades, and another new standard was written in 2000 to include some of the original colors. In 2004, the Mudi appeared on a Hungarian postage stamp to honor the dogs, which are considered national treasures, and they were added to the Foundation Stock Service the same year. The Mudi is currently the only herding breed that includes the merle color and solid white coats.</p><p>Today, the breed remains very rare. There are only a few thousand Mudis worldwide, with the greatest numbers being in Hungary, followed by Finland. While it's difficult to find elsewhere, these dogs are still a sought-after working breed. They still actively herd with Hungarian shepherds and their flocks containing as many as 500 sheep.</p><p>Mudis have also been used as search and rescue dogs in Finland and the United States. The breed excels at agility, obedience, and flyball among other dog sports. They've been eligible to compete in companion events since 2008, and more recently, they were approved to compete in the Miscellaneous Class on June 27, 2018, represented by the Mudi Club of America.</p><h2>Mudi Care</h2><p>The Mudi is typically easy to care for when it's raised in active homes with dog training experience, but new dog owners should use caution, as this breed requires plenty of exercise to be a well-mannered pet. In the grooming department, Mudis are low-maintenance and need little more than basic care.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Mudi is a very energetic, playful dog that requires at least an hour per day of exercise. This breed does best with a large yard to run around in, but owners should also plan for leashed walks and mental exercises like fetch or nose work to keep their dog entertained. They love to run, and they also excel at games like flyball, Frisbee, and agility sports.</p><p>Mudis can be relaxed, affectionate family companions indoors as long as they've received sufficient exercise throughout the day. Without enough activity, your Mudi may become mischievous and begin digging, jumping, or chewing inside.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Mudi is considered a low-maintenance breed that's easy to care for when it comes to grooming. They only require occasional baths, combing, or brushing to remove excess fur from their coats, though they aren't a high-shedding breed. Owners should also brush their dog's teeth, trim their nails, and check their ears for dirt and debris. Use a cleaner formulated for the ears with a cotton ball to gently clean your dog's ears as needed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Mudi is a vocal and alert dog that's adaptable and eager to please, so they are very trainable. Basic obedience lessons can begin as early as seven weeks of age. These dogs are also wary of strangers and make excellent watchdogs, especially because they're enthusiastic about having a job to do. This also means that owners will need to train the Mudi against excessive barking if it becomes too much. They are generally friendly with other household pets when raised together, but care should be taken to introduce your Mudi to plenty of new animals as a puppy to encourage a social temperament. These dogs make gentle, affectionate companions for children and families as long as they have been trained and socialized properly.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Mudi is an overall healthy breed, but like most purebreds, it can be susceptible to inherited health problems. Responsible breeders strive to keep their genetic lines as healthy as possible. When adopting a puppy from a breeder, always ensure that you're provided with their family's medical history.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Mudi should perform well with high-quality commercial or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times. As with all breeds, treats should be given in moderation and their diet should be controlled in order to avoid weight gain or obesity-related issues. Consult your veterinarian to determine the best portions and nutrients for your specific dog based on their age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mudi</h2><p>Since the Mudi is a very rare breed in the United States, prospective adopters may not have much luck finding these dogs in many shelters. However, breed-specific rescues can help you connect with a Mudi to join your family. Your local animal shelter may also have similar herding dog breeds in need of forever homes that might just become your next best friend.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a Mudi as a puppy, be sure to research responsible breeders and work with one that readily provides the litter's medical history. You should also be allowed to meet your puppy's parents and see that the dogs are kept in a safe, comfortable location indoors. Puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $2,500, but prices may vary to $3,000 or higher depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Mudi Overview</h2><p>Protective of their inner circle</p><p>Affectionate and family-friendly</p><p>Easily trainable, eager to please</p><p>Tendency to bark</p><p>Can be aggressive toward other pets if not socialized</p><p>Needs considerable daily exercise</p>",1254

This rare breed has been prized for centuries in Russia as a sled dog, hunting dog, and all-around family companion. </p><p>Spitz dogs (sometimes called Northern breeds) are known for their characteristic wolf-like appearance, including a wedge-shaped head and triangular upright ears. Many spitz breeds were bred to work alongside humans in cold conditions. Yakutian Laikas have always been treated more as companions than strictly working dogs, so they evolved to be extremely friendly toward humans. With the proper daily exercise and training care, your Yakutian Laika can become a devoted and lovable family member.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Spitz and primitive types (FCI)</p><p>Height: 21 to 23 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double coat with medium-length thick, glossy, and straight fur</p><p>Coat Color: Solid white or combination of white and black, brown, gray, or red</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, playful, energetic, intelligent, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Russia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Yakutian Laika</h2><p>The Yakutian Laika has a very affectionate personality, especially with its own family (including respectful children). However, these dogs may be wary of strangers initially until they get to know them or understand that they are welcome. They're protective of their owners and eager to please, which also makes them trainable as long as lessons are consistent, positive, and mentally stimulating.</p><p>This breed has a high prey drive, so shouldn't be trusted with small pets, though it can learn to live peacefully with a family cat. It's best to introduce your Yakutian Laika to cats early on to help it keep a friendly temperament toward them throughout its life.</p><h2>History of the Yakutian Laika</h2><p>The Yakutian Laika is an ancient dog breed that was bred by aboriginal people living in Northeast Russia at least since the 1600s, but possibly for thousands of years. It was loosely bred for centuries, but its numbers dwindled to dangerously low levels by the end of the 1900s, which put it at risk of disappearing forever. A group of Russian breeders passionate about the Yakutian Laika revived the breed in the late 1990s. The breed was repopulated using the first breed standard developed for the North-East Sled Dog, which was written in 1958. In 2004, the Yakutian Laika was accepted by the Russian Kynological Federation.</p><p>The Yakutian Laika is not yet recognized by the primary all-breed kennel clubs in North America (the American Kennel Club, Canadian Kennel Club, and the United Kennel Club), but it's part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service, which is a stepping stone toward eventual full recognition. It is recognized internationally by the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Cynologique Internationale (FCI). </p><h2>Yakutian Laika Care</h2><p>The Yakutian Laika is similar to other working breeds when it comes to its exercise needs, so owners should be prepared for a high-energy dog that requires plenty of activity each day. Training can be difficult at first, but this dog's intelligence helps it overcome stubborn habits when handled properly. Grooming a Yakutian Laika is easier than some other long-haired breeds, but it still sheds heavily twice per year.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like most dogs bred to pull sleds, Yakutian Laikas have abundant energy, stamina, and drive. They need a lot of daily exercise and mental stimulation to keep them from becoming bored and restless, which can result in destructive behaviors. At least an hour of exercise per day in the form of long walks, running, hiking, and fetching a Frisbee or ball is a good amount of activity to start with. Your Yakutian Laika will likely need more exercise to remain well-mannered at home during puppyhood and young adulthood.</p><p>If you live in an area that gets snow, Laikas can easily be trained to pull a sled-something they excel at and love to do. They may also enjoy training for competitive dog sports like agility to exercise both their body and mind.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Yakutian Laika's fluffy coat is relatively easy to care for. This dog naturally looks and feels clean, as its double coat repels dirt. No trimming is required, and occasional baths are sufficient on an as-needed basis.</p><p>The breed sheds a little most of the time, but it blows coat twice per year when it loses much of its undercoat. These heavy shedding seasons will require more care from owners to reduce shedding and remove extra fur. Outside of these seasons, brushing a few times a week is usually sufficient.</p><p>Like other dog breeds, Yakutian Laikas also need their nails trimmed, teeth brushed, and ears checked on a regular basis. Dogs that are active outdoors will likely require fewer nail trimmings than those that mostly stay in the home or yard. If your dog's ears are dirty, clean them with a pet-safe ear cleaner and a cotton ball. Red or inflamed ears are a sign of ear infection, in which case you should contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Though the Yakutian Laika likes to please its owner, these dogs can be fairly independent and may be more challenging to train than other working breeds. Start with basic obedience lessons when puppies are about eight weeks old, then move on to more advanced lessons as your dog matures. Early socialization in puppyhood is important to help your Laika grow up to be confident and accepting of strangers. </p><p>It's best to use positive training techniques and demonstrate to your dog that you are a fair and consistent guardian. Treats go a long way toward achieving success, but other reward options like affection and playtime can also be beneficial depending on what motivates your specific dog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Yakutian Laika is generally a very healthy breed with few serious inherited diseases. However, like most purebreds, this breed can still develop common health issues. Reputable breeders test adult dogs prior to breeding them to lower the risk of passing these problems down to puppies.</p><p>According to the AKC, the national breed club recommends that breeders perform OFA tests on the elbows, hips, and eyes before breeding Yakutian Laikas.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Some Yakutian Laikas, especially those that are highly active, may need to eat an energy-dense, high-quality food so they consume enough calories to support their level of activity. Others may be less active and require a lower-calorie diet to avoid gaining too much weight or experiencing canine obesity.</p><p>Monitor your dog's weight to help prevent joint disorders like dysplasia and arthritis, as well as other health problems like diabetes. Since Yakutian Laikas are prone to Bloat, it's best to feed this breed at least two smaller portions per day rather than one large meal. Talk to your veterinarian to determine a healthy meal plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Yakutian Laika</h2><p>The Yakutian Laika is extremely rare, especially in the United States, and is not yet recognized by any of the main kennel clubs in North America. Finding these dogs in animal shelters is unlikely, but your local shelter may introduce you to similar breeds in need of forever homes.</p><p>If you'd like to adopt a Yakutian Laika puppy, it's essential to research responsible breeders. Adopters should be allowed to meet the litter's parents and see their medical history. Some travel may be required, and breeders typically charge between $1,200 and $1,400 for puppies (although prices can vary based on pedigree and availability).</p><h2>Yakutian Laika Overview</h2><p>Easy-care coat</p><p>Hardworking and athletic</p><p>Intelligent and affectionate</p><p>Rare breed that can be difficult to find</p><p>Requires lots of daily exercise</p><p>May be challenging to train</p>",1245

Though its size can be intimidating, the Neapolitan Mastiff is a gentle giant that makes an excellent large family dog. These dogs are just as protective as they are loving toward their owners, and they are also low-maintenance and easygoing companions. If you're looking for a best friend that can also help keep you safe, the Neapolitan Mastiff is up for the job.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 24 to 31 inches</p><p>Weight: 110 to 150 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, shiny fur</p><p>Coat Color: Black, blue, mahogany, tawny, or brindle</p><p>Life Span: 7 to 9 years</p><p>Temperament: Protective, stubborn, fearless, companionable, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Neapolitan Mastiff</h2><p>Along with its unique appearance, this breed makes a great companion. Neapolitan Mastiffs love their families unconditionally, but they can be wary of strangers, making them great guard dogs to protect their homes from intruders. Their fearless and protective attitude is sure to frighten any unwanted visitors. When it comes to spending time with their owners, Neapolitan Mastiffs have especially affectionate personalities. They're not usually a playful breed, but your Mastiff will be happy to curl up inside or go for a walk a few times each day.</p><h2>History of the Neapolitan Mastiff</h2><p>Tales and images of the Neapolitan Mastiff date back as early as 700 B.C., according to the AKC. In fact, Alexander the Great is credited for their great reverence and good looks. In the fourth century B.C., he crossed his famous giant war dogs with short-haired Indian dogs to create a breed known as the molossus, which he used in battle.</p><p>The Romans took note and later adopted the molossus breed for their own use in combat and hunting. They eventually crossed these dogs with other large breeds to create an even larger and more intimidating canine: the mastino.</p><p>The mastino was selectively bred by farmers in southern Italy to develop a breed large in size with loose, saggy skin and a smooth coat. In their selective breeding, they also aimed to develop a dog that was more family-friendly than the mastino, while still being a top-notch guard dog and protector. This breed became known as the Neapolitan Mastiff, named after its origin city of Naples.</p><p>The Neapolitan Mastiff soon became a national treasure in Italy, and six of them were reportedly shown in the first dog show in Naples in 1946. Italian painter Piero Scanziani drafted the breed standard in 1948, then the Italian Kennel Club officially recognized the breed the following year.</p><p>The breed spread throughout Europe in the 1970s and soon made its way to America. The United States Neapolitan Mastiff Club became the primary register for the breed in the 1990s. In 2004, the American Kennel Club officially accepted the Neapolitan Mastiff into the Working Group.</p><h2>Neapolitan Mastiff Care</h2><p>Neapolitan Mastiffs are known for their laid-back temperament and short, wrinkly coats. Your Mastiff will require less exercise than other working breeds. However, these dogs still require plenty of training and grooming care to be healthy, well-mannered companions at home.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While Neapolitan Mastiffs can be couch potatoes, owners should still ensure they're active for about 20 minutes at least twice daily. They do not require a lot of exercise, but regular walks are crucial for managing weight and joint health.</p><p>As puppies, this giant breed is a different story. Neapolitan Mastiff puppies are generally energetic and playful, but it is up to their owners to know when enough is enough. Because their bones are so big, joints can be easily damaged. It's important to limit your puppy's running and jumping activity while ensuring they do not climb up stairs too quickly. Keep an eye on them-especially in warm weather, as they are prone to overheating-and stop play before your pup gets too tired.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Enormous, muscular, and wrinkly, the Neapolitan Mastiff seems like a challenge to keep clean. Basic grooming like weekly brushings will help keep their coat clean and manage shedding. With regular brushing, you can keep baths on an as-needed basis. Just make sure to wipe their wrinkles down daily, then dry them completely to remove any dirt or other unwanted debris.</p><p>Regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, and teeth brushing will also enhance your Neapolitan Mastiff's overall health and wellbeing. Because of their droopy jowls that are prone to drooling, many owners keep a slobber rag handy.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training your Neapolitan Mastiff should begin as soon as possible, preferably during puppyhood at about eight weeks of age. As they get older, individuals can become stubborn and difficult to train, so it is important to get on top of things at an early age.</p><p>Because they are wary of strangers and naturally suspicious of outsiders, socialization training is key for Neapolitan Mastiffs. Take your dog to public spaces on a regular basis. At home, help them learn how to welcome guests appropriately and distinguish between friend and foe.</p><p>Neapolitan Mastiffs are not responsive to punishment. Instead, they respond well to positive reinforcement with affection and treats to reward good behavior. The same is true during grooming-treat them with love if they resist bath time.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like other purebred dogs, Neapolitan Mastiffs are prone to a few inherited health problems. Joint health is a concern due to their large size. With all of their extra skin and hardy muscles, their joints are carrying a lot of weight. Ask your veterinarian for a hip and elbow evaluation along with preventative care tips. Responsible breeders should also test parent dogs for issues before breeding, and your puppy's medical history should be provided during the adoption process.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Neapolitan Mastiff high-quality dog food and provide plenty of fresh water at all times. Avoid foods with lots of fillers like animal by-products and pulp that lack essential nutrients. Natural, whole ingredients are best for your dog's digestive system. Ask your veterinarian to help you determine the best food and portion sizes based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><p>According to the American Kennel Club, experienced Neapolitan Mastiff breeders recommend food that is slightly higher in fat and lower in protein, especially for younger dogs who grow rapidly. Discuss any diet and nutritional concerns with your veterinarian. Because of their large size, it's best to feed these dogs several small portions of food per day rather than one large meal to help prevent Bloat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Neopolitan Mastiff</h2><p>It's not likely for prospective adopters to find Neapolitan Mastiffs in shelters, but your local shelter may have similar breeds available for adoption. Breed-specific rescues are also a great place to start your search if you're certain that the Neapolitan Mastiff is the right match for your home. Your local shelter may be able to refer you to these regional resources.</p><p>When adopting a puppy from a breeder, it's essential to do your research. Responsible breeders will provide all relevant medical tests for the litter's family. The breeder of your choice should also allow you to meet the litter's parents and see the conditions in which their dogs are kept.</p><h2>Neapolitan Mastiff Overview</h2><p>Loyal, protective guard dog</p><p>Mellow and gentle with its family</p><p>Does not require much exercise</p><p>Prone to joint disease due to its large size</p><p>May become stubborn and difficult to train with age</p><p>Wrinkles need regular cleaning of dirt and debris</p>",1224
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/chinese-crested-dog-breed-profile-4589181,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Toy Dog Breeds,<h1>Chinese Crested: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Chinese Crested: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The Chinese crested is a small breed in the toy group that somewhat resembles the well-known Chihuahua, however, these native Chinese dogs have mostly hairless bodies with large poufs of hair on their heads, paws, and tails. Not many breeds turn more heads than this one thanks to its eye-catching appearance. About half of Chinese crested dogs are actually powderpuffs,"" a variation of the breed that has fur throughout their bodies.</p><p>When considering which pet to bring home, it's important to go beyond looks. The Chinese crested is also a bright, affectionate little dog with a cheerful personality. These compact canines are surprisingly energetic and quite trainable, giving them a winning personality to go with their unique looks.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat: Soft, silky hair only present on the head, feet, and tail (or ""powderpuff"" fully-coated variety)</p><p>Coat Color: White, gray, or black hair and gray, pink, or brown skin with white patches</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 18 years</p><p>Temperament: Lively, playful, cheerful, intelligent, social, companionable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: China</p><h2>Characteristics of the Chinese Crested Dog</h2><p>These little dogs are known for being smart, cheerful, and friendly. Their playful personalities are helpful when it comes to getting their exercise in, though this dog does not require as much physical activity as sporting or hunting breeds of similar size. Your Chinese crested dog will likely be satisfied with a decent walk and a few play sessions each day. Since this breed is highly intelligent, it also excels with training and enjoys participating in day-to-day household life. Its small size and moderate exercise requirements make the Chinese crested an excellent choice for apartment living.</p><h2>History of the Chinese Crested Dog</h2><p>This breed is so old that very little is known about its history. The best historical guess is that a large hairless breed of dog was brought to China, where it was minimized into a new breed. These dogs quickly became famous as the rat exterminators of Chinese ships, much like the schipperke breed on Belgian ships.</p><p>The ship-going nature of this breed means that variations can be found worldwide. European travelers noted that there were little hairless dogs-probably Chinese crested pups-throughout Africa, Asia, Central America, and South America.</p><p>A pair of women in the late 1800s brought the breed to popularity in the United States. Ida Garrett was a prolific writer and speaker who brought fame and interest to the breed. Meanwhile, Debra Woods established a breeding program with well-kept studbooks. In 1991, the Chinese crested was recognized as a member of the Toy Group in the American Kennel Club (AKC) and became a registerable breed.</p><h2>Chinese Crested Dog Care</h2><p>Since they're small, smart, and easygoing, Chinese crested dogs can suit a variety of lifestyles. They don't require much exercise in comparison to many popular breeds, and they're relatively easy to train. Your Chinese crested will, however, require specific grooming care for its silky fur and hairless skin.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Chinese crested dogs do best with some mental and physical activity every day. A few short walks each day will offer enough exercise to keep this breed healthy. Although they're athletic and enjoy playing, they are very small and can be quite delicate. They are not sturdy enough for most young children, but they can be an excellent match for gentle families or older kids interested in learning how to train dogs.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Aside from proper exercise, these dogs require some extra support and care in the grooming department. The powderpuff variety needs plenty of brushing like other long-haired breeds, and both types of Chinese crested dogs require regular nail trimming and teeth cleaning.</p><p>The hairless variety of these dogs requires more careful attention outdoors. They need sunscreen or clothing to prevent sunburn, and their skin is likely to experience rashes, irritation, scrapes, and more. If you are looking for a dog to play with outside, this is not the most low-maintenance breed option.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Chinese crested dogs are smart and respond quickly to positive reinforcement-based training when it comes to obedience. Avoid correction-based training with this breed, as their intelligence also means that they are sensitive to various emotions and can become anxious with harsh training.</p><p>These dogs also excel at canine sports like agility, flyball, and lure coursing. Despite their small stature and diva-like looks, they are formidable athletes. At the very least, puzzle toys and teaching new tricks are great ways to keep your dog's mind and body in shape.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like most purebred dogs, the Chinese crested is susceptible to several genetic ailments. If you're purchasing a puppy from a breeder, it's essential to see results from medical tests on the parents (and each puppy, if possible). If your breeder does not provide these important tests, it's best to search for another that does.</p><p>The AKC recommends that, at a minimum, breeders screen their dogs for eye problems, knee problems, heart problems, the PRA-RCD3 DNA Test, and the PLL DNA Test. When considering a puppy, be sure to ask if any of the puppy's relatives have had epilepsy.</p><p>Supporting breeders who maintain good health testing is much more than just asking if the puppies have seen a vet. The parent dogs (and grandparents and other relatives, ideally) should have medical imagery, DNA tests, and specific exams performed to rule out common issues for this breed. Purchasing a puppy with health-tested parents means you have a better chance of spending a long, healthy life together.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all dogs, Chinese crested dogs require good nutrition. A high-quality dog food specific to small breeds should do the trick. Since this breed is prone to rashes and skin inflammation, many owners also opt for allergy-specific food along with maintaining regular grooming. Some Chinese crested dogs even benefit from acne medication.</p><p>With the hairless variety of this breed, it is relatively easy to tell if your dog puts on too much weight. You should be able to see a narrowing of the waist between their hips and ribs. If you cannot see that, it is time to reduce your dog's meal size.</p><p>For the powderpuff variety, feel along your dog's ribs through the fur. You should be able to find the rib cage and hip bones easily, but the ribs should not protrude much. Puzzle feeders are a great option (in addition to smaller portions) to help slow your dog down during mealtimes and burn off a little extra energy.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Chinese Crested Dog</h2><p>Is a Chinese crested right for you? Before you bring home a new dog, it's helpful to explore whether their personalities and needs are a good match for your home. Speak to owners, breeders, and rescue groups along with meeting this breed in person to learn more. If there are no Chinese crested dogs available in local shelters, research responsible breeders in your local area. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000, while the powderpuff variety can cost upwards of $4,000.</p><h2>Chinese Crested Dog Overview</h2><p>Athletic and agile</p><p>Intelligent, easy to train</p><p>Unique appearance</p><p>Requires special grooming and skin care</p><p>Not the best breed for families with young children</p><p>Prone to several diseases common in smaller dogs</p>",1220

These adorable dogs are fearless workers and easily recognizable by their eye-catching fur. Bred to be a compact sheepdog, the Pumi was once responsible for moving flocks on narrow roads between pastures in western Hungary thanks to its penchant for gathering, driving, and keeping livestock under control.</p><p>Today, the Pumi is well-known for its exceptional intelligence and unique personality. This dog's charming and affectionate temperament, along with its expressive ears and facial character, make the Pumi both a cute family companion and a determined herding dog with boundless energy for work and play.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 15 to 18.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 22 to 29 pounds</p><p>Coat: Curly, wavy, medium-length double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, fawn, gray, silver-gray, white, brown (some born gray or brown, which fades over time)</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Energetic, intelligent, protective, active, trainable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Hungary</p><h2>Characteristics of the Pumi</h2><p>The Pumi is best-known for its athleticism and sincere devotion to the people it loves. These dogs are very protective of their families, but they're far more likely to alert their owners of suspicious strangers than to become aggressive thanks to their friendly personalities. As long as training and socialization begin early, they'll be fine sharing their home with children and other animals.</p><p>This breed is known for being vocal, so prospective owners should prepare for barking. Thankfully, since they have a very trainable temperament, they can learn to control their barking if it becomes excessive. Your Pumi will also do best with plenty of mentally engaging toys to prevent destructive behaviors from developing when boredom strikes. With plenty of exercise and attention, the Pumi can be a loyal companion to all members of your family.</p><h2>History of the Pumi</h2><p>The Pumi has often been referred to as the Hungarian herding terrier because of its terrier-like attributes, such as its quick movement, alert temperament, and lean, muscular body type. It was also given the nickname ""the clown"" for its playful personality and expressive face. This breed is thought to be a result of livestock trading between Hungary, France, and Germany.</p><p>It's believed that three sheepdogs were originally bred in Hungary-the Mudi, Puli, and Pumi. The Puli is the oldest of the three, established as far back as A.D. 800. This ancestral Hungarian herding dog likely migrated with the Magyars from the Ural-Altay region between China and the Caspian Sea to the Carpathian Basin. About 300 to 400 years ago, the Puli was mixed with French and German herding dogs and terriers to create the Pumi. It's said that the Mudi evolved naturally from crosses of the Puli, Pumi, and German Spitz breeds.</p><p>The Pumi can also be traced back to herding and guard breeds from China and Tibet. This includes the Tsang Apso, a widespread breed in the region that was mistakenly called the Tibetan Terrier by Europeans. The Pumi was first considered a regional variant of the Puli, but by the early 1900s, the two dogs became standardized as their own separate breeds.</p><p>The international breed standard for the Pumi was approved in 1935. It became an officially recognized breed in the United States in 2011 and in the United Kingdom in 2015. The first Pumi dogs were imported to Finland in the early 1970s. Today, the breed is the most popular of all the herding dogs in Finland.</p><p>There are currently more than 2,000 Pumi dogs registered in Hungary, but notable populations are also found in Finland and Sweden. The Pumi is bred in smaller numbers in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany.</p><h2>Pumi Care</h2><p>While the Pumi is an especially trainable dog, it requires significant exercise and mental stimulation to be its best. Owners should also prepare for regular grooming to keep this dog's curly double coat in good condition.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Your Pumi will thrive with at least one hour of exercise each day combined with play sessions, training lessons, or activities like agility sports to keep its mind occupied. These dogs are playful and still retain a strong herding drive, so homes that can provide an outlet for these instincts are best. Simple games like fetch can also be a fun option for owners to keep this dog active at home. The Pumi is agile and known to climb, so having a tall fence around the yard is ideal (along with training for a reliable recall). Aside from playing and training, your Pumi will be happy to join you for runs, hikes, bike rides, or any other outdoor adventure.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Pumi's double coat is made up of a soft undercoat and a coarser, harsher outercoat. Occasional trimming and combing every three to six weeks will help prevent mats and tangles. For its curls to re-form, its coat should be wetted after combing (and be sure to skip the blow dryer after baths). During this process, owners may notice more stray fur than usual, but this dog's coat is typically low-shedding.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Pumi's intelligence and alert nature make these dogs easy to train, and they seem to have an endless desire to work with their humans. Basic obedience lessons can begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. The Pumi also excels at advanced training for herding or canine sports as it grows older.</p><p>Some behavioral issues that can arise without proper training and exercise include digging, barking, and a tendency to herd people by nipping at their heels. While the Pumi makes a great watchdog, it's also likely to become an excessive barker. These behaviors should be discouraged early by redirecting the dog's attention to desired actions with rewards. Positive reinforcement methods are very effective, so it's best to avoid any types of training that involve punishment.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Pumi breed is generally regarded as healthy, but like other purebreds, it's still prone to some inherited conditions. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards by testing adult dogs prior to breeding. If you plan to adopt a Pumi as a puppy, ask your breeder to provide the litter's medical history.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Pumi should perform well with high-quality commercial dog food or a home-prepared diet under veterinary supervision. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times for this active, high-energy breed.</p><p>These dogs may become overweight if they aren't receiving the correct portions and a generous amount of exercise, so be sure to monitor your Pumi's calorie consumption (including healthy treats). Talk to your veterinarian to determine a healthy diet and portion schedule based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pumi</h2><p>If you think this breed is right for you, talk to other Pumi owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more about its care. Since the Pumi is a somewhat rare breed in North America, it's not always likely to find these dogs in shelters, but you can check local rescue groups for Pumi dogs and similar breeds in need of forever homes.</p><p>When adopting a puppy from a breeder, it's essential to do your research. Ensure you're provided with the litter's medical history, allowed to meet their parents, and able to see that the dogs are raised in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Pumi puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $3,000, but prices can vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Pumi Overview</h2><p>Very kid-friendly, great with other pets</p><p>Intelligent and eager to learn</p><p>Low-shedding coat</p><p>Requires regular grooming and considerable daily exercise</p><p>May bark excessively</p><p>Prone to destructive behaviors like chewing or digging when bored</p>",1254

These compact dogs are still robust with their lively and lovable personalities.</p><p>Affectionately called the ""King of Toys,"" the Min Pin is a loyal, smart breed with a stubborn streak. Despite its size, this breed is athletic. It is prized for its unique ""hackney gait,"" which looks similar to a horse's trot. It lifts its front feet up and out with a bend at the wrist, but unlike horses, the Min Pin only trots with its front legs. Along with its elegant appearance, this breed makes a great companion for active families.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 10 to 12.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 10 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, shiny fur</p><p>Coat Color: Solid red, stag red (red with some black hairs), black with rust markings, chocolate with rust markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, playful, intelligent, protective, brave</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Miniature Pinscher</h2><p>The breed is generally fearless and bold. Miniature Pinschers have watchdog instincts, and thanks to their history as rat hunters, they're also skilled at catching small animals (which should be watched carefully in homes with these pets). However, when it comes to life in a family household, the Min Pin is a spirited companion with a playful personality that loves spending time with its owners.</p><p>Min Pins can do well with children and other animals when socialized properly. Their small bodies are more prone to injuries than medium-sized dogs, and they may growl or bite when handled improperly, so children should learn how to interact with them safely. With cats and other dogs, your Min Pin should have a sociable temperament if introduced properly.</p><h2>History of the Miniature Pinscher</h2><p>The Miniature Pinscher originated in Germany, and the breed dates back several hundred years to its origins hunting rats on farms. It was first called the Reh Pinscher because of its supposed similarity to the reh, or small deer, that once inhabited Germany's forests.</p><p>It is thought that the breed descended from the German Standard Pinscher, as did the Doberman Pinscher. The Min Pin is not a bred-down version of the Doberman, however, as it actually pre-dates that breed. Dachshunds and Italian Greyhounds are also likely ancestors of Min Pins.</p><p>In 1895, German breeders formed the Pinscher Klub-later renamed the Pinscher-Schnauzer Klub-and the first breed standard was written. Min Pins were shown at the Stuttgart Dog Show for the first time in 1900.</p><p>Between 1905 and World War I, the Min Pin's popularity in Germany grew. After World War I, breeders in Germany and Scandinavian countries worked to improve the genetic line. Around 1919, the first Miniature Pinschers were imported into the United States. Only a few were shown in American Kennel Club (AKC) dog shows at first. But by 1929, the Miniature Pinscher Club of America was formed. Officially registered by the AKC in 1925, the Min Pin's popularity has continued to grow over the years.</p><h2>Miniature Pinscher Care</h2><p>Miniature Pinschers are active little dogs that need plenty of training to be well-mannered companions, but with the right care, they can make great pets for a variety of families. Thanks to their short coats, they don't require much aside from standard grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Though the Min Pin can be an affectionate companion, they aren't suitable lap dogs. The breed does best in an active but attentive household. Min Pins are very energetic dogs that need plenty of exercise to stay healthy. Plan for 45 minutes to an hour per day of playtime, walks, and other activities for this breed. Keeping your Min Pin mentally stimulated is also important, as these dogs can become bored easily. Games like hide-and-seek and fetch are fun ways for you to play with your dog while exercising its mind.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Min Pin has erect ears that may be cropped and a tail that may be docked. Its coat is smooth, shiny, and very short, which requires only simple grooming. Brush your dog's fur weekly or up to daily to maintain a healthy appearance. These dogs don't shed much, but like most breeds, their owners still need to keep up with other regular care like trimming the nails, brushing the teeth, and cleaning the ears as needed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Proper training is an absolute must with this breed, which can begin with basic obedience lessons when puppies are about eight weeks old. The Min Pin is quite smart and tends to respond well to training. Without effective training, the breed can become stubborn and unruly. Either way, the Min Pin can be quite the character, so expect to be entertained by its antics.</p><p>The Min Pin's lively attitude and dynamic personality make it a great companion for the right home. With appropriate socialization, Min Pins may be able to get along well with children if raised together. These dogs also enjoy fun canine sports like agility training that exercise their body and mind together.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like other purebred dogs, Miniature Pinschers can be susceptible to genetic health problems. Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to develop hereditary conditions. If you plan to adopt a Miniature Pinscher as a puppy, ask your breeder to provide the litter's medical background.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Active, growing Min Pin puppies need about one ounce of high-quality dog food per pound of body weight each day, spread out over three or four meals. Adults, on the other hand, can eat one to two meals per day (about half an ounce of food per pound of body weight). Clean, fresh water should be available at all times for these active dogs. </p><p>Puppies and young adults that get plenty of exercise may benefit from a diet rich in protein, while older or less active dogs may need a diet with added fiber and reduced fat to prevent them from gaining weight. Monitor your dog's weight and limit treats to prevent future health conditions associated with canine obesity.</p><p>To determine the best meal plan, consult your veterinarian about a healthy diet based on your specific dog's age, weight, activity level, and any allergies or health conditions.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Miniature Pinscher</h2><p>Before adopting a Miniature Pinscher, talk to other Min Pin owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more about the breed. The best place to start your search is at your local shelter. Breed-specific rescues are also great places to find dogs in need of forever homes, while shelters in your region may have Min Pins or similar dogs that can be great additions to your family.</p><p>When adopting a puppy from a breeder, it's essential to do your research. Find a responsible breeder that readily provides the litter's medical history and allows potential adopters to meet the parents. Min Pin puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000, but prices may be lower or higher depending on availability and the litter's pedigree.</p><h2>Miniature Pinscher Overview</h2><p>Small size; great companions for apartments and travel</p><p>Lively, fun temperament</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>High tendency to bark</p><p>Wary of strangers and can become aggressive</p><p>Can feel threatened by small children</p>",1194

They were believed to stem from naturally-occurring matings between the American bobcat and feral domestic cats or barn cats, although there is no verifiable proof since DNA tests do not back up the claim.</p><p>Still, Pixie-bob cats are large and sturdy and look a lot like bobcats. Legally, they are domestic cats and their ownership is not restricted like exotic wild cats. They are beautiful, playful, loyal, and make good companions for almost any type of household, including those with children or other pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other names: Pixiebob</p><p>Personality: Easy-going, friendly, affectionate, active, and intelligent</p><p>Weight: 8 to 17 pounds</p><p>Length: 20 to 24 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Long-haired or short-haired</p><p>Coat Color: All shades of brown</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby with small-to-medium spots, especially on the belly</p><p>Eye Color: Golden brown or green</p><p>Lifespan: 13 to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Pixie-Bob Characteristics</h2><p>Cats are not usually known for having a love of water, but many Pixie-bobs do. Pixie-bob aficionados claim water affinity as further evidence of their wild background. Still, as a general rule, this is a very easy-going breed that enjoys plenty of interaction with its family. Their vocalization is usually limited to chirps and twitters, although they will meow occasionally.</p><p>They are known for getting along well with both children and other pets. This breed is also sturdy and laid-back enough to tolerate playing with kids, although children should always be old enough to treat a pet with respect. Any cat will become defensive if teased or mistreated.</p><p>Pixie-bobs are usually happy to be part of a family with cat-friendly dogs or fellow felines. You should monitor any cat around pet rodents, birds, or fish, however, since their natural hunting instincts can kick in at any time.</p><h2>History of the Pixie-Bob</h2><p>Carol Ann Brewer, the breed founder, purchased a short-tailed, polydactyl (extra toes) male spotted kitten in 1985. Shortly after that, she adopted a male rescue cat that was exceptionally large and also had a bobbed tail. Rumor said that this cat was the product of a mating between a domestic cat and a bobcat. The cat mated with a neighbor's brown tabby, producing a litter of kittens. Brewer adopted one of the female kittens with a spotted, ""wild"" appearance, and named it Pixie.</p><p>Over the next several years, Brewer sought out cats with bobbed tails and spots, particularly those rumored to be the products of matings between domestic cats and bobcats. Eventually, she had 23 of these cats, which she used as the foundation for her new breed, named Pixie-bob in honor of her first female. Brewer trademarked the term ""legend cats"" to describe felines that she believed to be mixes of bobcats and domestic cats. However, DNA testing has not indicated that these cats truly have bobcat genes.</p><p>The Pixie-bob breed was accepted into the International Cat Association as a native new breed in 1993 and for championship status in 1997. The breed was accepted by the American Cat Fanciers Association in 2005.</p><p>The International Cat Association designation of the Pixie-bob as a ""native new breed"" means that it is a new breed that has been identified as genetically similar individuals from a naturally occurring population indigenous to a particular geographic region. However, although TICA standard cites the resemblance to the American bobcat, the founding committee is adamant that no captive American bobcats be used in any breeding program.</p><h2>Pixie-Bob Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Pixie-bobs come in longhair and shorthair versions. The shorthair has a thick double coat, while the longhair's coat is up to 2 inches in length with a softer, silkier texture. Both types can shed quite a bit. To keep shedding under control, and prevent mats or hairballs, you should brush your Pixie-bob at least twice weekly, using a rubber or metal brush designed for the length of your cat's fur.</p><p>Keep your cat's nails trimmed and provide a scratching post. Help maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your cat's teeth frequently.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Pixie-bob is described as dog-like in personality. These cats can be leash-trained easily and love to take walks with their humans. Provide plenty of interactive cat toys and spend time playing with your cat to keep it exercised and mentally stimulated. Your Pixie-bob will also appreciate one or more cat trees with plenty of varied-level perches for climbing, leaping, and exploring.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Pixie-bobs are actively out-crossed to provide genetic diversity, and they do not seem to have any particular health problems that might arise with inbreeding. They are prone to the usual conditions and diseases that affect any domestic cat, of course.</p><p>You should provide the recommended health care for your cat, including immunizations, preventative veterinary treatments, and checkups. Breeders should be able to provide documentation of health checks for their cats.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Much like bobcats, Pixie-bobs have a muscular, rangy appearance with a woolly coat standing up from the body. Their fur is light to medium brown, often with a reddish tint. They are adorned in a signature tabby pattern with a mix of spots and stripes. The spots are especially pronounced on the belly. Their eye color can be golden brown or green, according to the breed standard.</p><p>These cats often have lynx-tipped ears and most sport some level of ""mutton chop"" sideburns. Their tails, as the name implies, are naturally bobbed, with a minimum length of 2 inches, but no longer than the cat's hocks, which are the ""knees"" of the hind legs.</p><p>The Pixie-bob is one of the few breeds that allows polydactyl toes in the breed standard, with a maximum of seven toes per paw. Normally, cats have five toes on each front paw and four toes on each hind paw.</p><p>Pixie-bobs shed a fair amount, and they are not a hypoallergenic breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Pixie-bobs do not have any special nutritional requirements. Whether you provide wet food, dry food, or a combination is a personal choice.</p><p>Some cats don't drink enough water and need wet food to provide fluids. Your cat's teeth can benefit from some crunchy dry food. Obesity will reduce the lifespan of any cat, so be sure to monitor your cat's calorie intake, however.</p><p>Pixie-bobs are large cats, but they should be muscular, not fat. Your cat's metabolism and overall health will change throughout its life. Discuss your cat's nutritional needs with your veterinarian at each visit to get recommendations for feeding schedules, types of food, and amount to feed.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pixie-Bob</h2><p>Pixie-bobs are a fairly rare breed, so it is not often that one will end up in a rescue or shelter. Still, it's always worthwhile to check your local rescues in case one turns up. You can also look for Pixie-bob breeders at cat shows, or by searching online for catteries specializing in this breed.</p><h2>Pixie-Bob Overview</h2><p>Pixie-bobs look like wildcats, but have good-natured, laid-back personalities. Still, they do enjoy a lot of exercise, play, and affectionate interaction with their humans, as well as with other household pets. These large, short-tailed felines do shed quite a bit, but the grooming requirements are worth it for the fun and enjoyment these unusual cats will bring to your home.</p><p>These cats have other unique traits, as well, including their tendency to have extra toes and their preference for trills and chirps, rather than meows.</p><p>Has fierce, exotic look, while considered as a domestic cat</p><p>Loyal, affectionate, and child- and pet-friendly</p><p>Highly intelligent, can be leash trained</p><p>Moderate to heavy shedders</p><p>Require plenty of exercise and play opportunities</p>",1226
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/borzoi-dog-breed-profile-4769877,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hound Dog Breeds,<h1>Borzoi: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Borzoi: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>Borzoi dogs are large hounds native to Russia with deep chests, narrow limbs, and smooth, long fur. A dignified dog bred as regal members of the Russian aristocracy, the Borzoi has long been considered one of the most beautiful breeds. Though these elegant sighthounds are agreeable and calm, their impressive speed was historically used to hunt wolves.</p><p>Borzois have the ability to run at 35 to 40 miles an hour-which isn't surprising since underneath their luxurious silky coat is the ancient blood of the Greyhound. Today, Borzois are affectionate and loyal family pets that possess both strength and style.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 28 to 34 inches (males); 26 to 32 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 75 to 105 pounds (males); 60 to 85 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Flat, wavy, or curly</p><p>Coat Color: White, brown, black, cream, tan, and other variations</p><p>Life Span: 9 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Calm, quiet, athletic, gentle, attentive, intelligent</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Russia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Borzoi</h2><p>Like the Greyhound, the Borzoi has a very even-tempered, calm, and quiet personality with gentle and elegant mannerisms. Though they make loyal, affectionate family pets, Borzoi aren't the type of dogs to do a lot of roughhousing with children-they're a bit too dignified for that. They can often be reserved with strangers but affectionate with their family and people they know well. Because of their strong prey drive and instincts to hunt and chase, Borzoi dogs may not always do well entering a home with other pets; ideally, they should be introduced to other animals in the home when they are puppies.</p><h2>History of the Borzoi</h2><p>Known as the Russian Wolfhound until 1936, the Borzoi dog was bred to be fast, strong, and tough enough to pursue some of the most ferocious quarries. They originated in 17<sup>th</sup>century Russia when Arabian greyhounds were bred with a thick-coated Russian dog. Appropriately, ""Borzoi"" is the masculine singular form of an archaic Russian adjective that means ""fast.""</p><p>The Russian concept of hunting trials was developed during the era of the Tzars; these tests were often used to select Borzoi breeding stock so that only the fastest and most intelligent hunting dogs were bred. They hunted in packs, sometimes with more than 100 dogs, including just as many Foxhounds and people to assist them in their pursuit of game-which was sometimes hare and small animals, but more often than not, Borzoi hunted wolves.</p><p>What would become the first Borzoi standard was written in 1650, and they were bred by the Russian aristocracy for hundreds of years. Exports of Borzoi to other countries were rare during the Soviet era, but enough of these dogs had been taken to countries including England, Scandinavia, Western Europe, and America by the late 19th century for the breed to establish itself outside its native country. The Borzoi is said to have made its way to America in 1889, when William Wade of Hulton, Pennsylvania brought one of these dogs over; the dog was originally purchased from Freeman Lloyd.</p><h2>Borzoi Care</h2><p>Since Borzois are known as gentle giants, it's easy to mistake them for a very low-maintenance breed. However, while even temperament does consume most of their days, these dogs do need consistent exercise and mindful, positive reinforcement-based training to live happily. It's also important to groom this breed regularly to maintain their silky coats.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These large, athletic dogs require at least an hour of daily exercise in the form of long walks. It's imperative to have a fenced-in yard and only walk these powerful sighthound dogs on a leash, as the sight of wildlife like a cat or squirrel on the run is far too tempting for their strong pursuit instinct. This breed also takes great pleasure in participating in active, outdoor activities with their owners, and they tend to excel in canine sports like lure coursing and agility.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Due to their long, silky coat, the Borzoi is a shedder and needs a brushing every couple of days with a pin or slicker brush and/or comb to remove loose hair and dirt. The Borzoi has an annual shedding season in the summer and fall when more frequent grooming is necessary. This breed's coat is unique in its texture along with its distribution over the body; there should be a frill on its neck as well as feathering on its hindquarters and tail. As with most dogs, this breed also requires regular bathing and nail trimming.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Owning a Borzoi typically requires plenty of patience, consistency, and a little bit of humor. In some ways, these dogs are catlike, as they can be both quiet and stubborn. When it comes to training, the Borzoi may be intelligent, gentle, and well-mannered, but they are also independent (so training may be somewhat of a challenge). They are likely to become easily bored with repetitive and seemingly pointless activity-and like other sighthounds, they are very sensitive to harsh treatment. This means that your Borzoi will not be able to cope with raised voices or any form of punishment-based training. Early socialization and positive reinforcement training are key.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Borzois are generally healthy dogs, but they have been associated with some health issues that can affect their stomachs, joints, and eyes. As with all breeds, this dog's ears and teeth should also be cleaned on a regular basis.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Surprisingly, Borzoi dogs typically eat less than other dogs of their size, and puppies tend to consume more food than adults due to their rapid growth. Borzoi owners should be mindful about overfeeding or offering too many treats, as these dogs can potentially become overweight and subject to obesity-related issues.</p><p>The Borzoi should do well on high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared with veterinary supervision. Choose food appropriate to your dog's age, considering whether they are a puppy, adult, or senior. Their age also correlates to the recommended number of feedings per day (and amount of food per meal), so consult with your veterinarian to determine a healthy, safe eating plan as your dog grows.</p><p>Because of the tendency of these dogs to run and chase, it's important to time their meals carefully. Avoid feeding your Borzoi before or after they engage in any strenuous exercise, as this can be a contributing factor to bloat. Clean, fresh water should be available at all times for this active breed.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Borzoi</h2><p>Be sure to check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for Borzoi dogs. The national rescue group for Borzoi dogs, the Borzoi Club of America, can also help you find your new best friend. Purchasing a Borzoi puppy from a breeder typically costs between $1,000 and $2,000, but the price can range up to about $5,000 depending on the breeder.</p><h2>Borzoi Overview</h2><p>Calm and gentle</p><p>Intelligent</p><p>Loyal to family, friendly with children</p><p>High shedding</p><p>Sensitive; needs positive reinforcement-based training</p><p>Needs regular grooming</p>",1124

Using positive reinforcement training will encourage your American bulldog to show off its friendliness to everyone it meets, as this breed can have an especially affectionate temperament once familiar with new people.</p><p>Regular exercise is important for these strong dogs to beat boredom, which can manifest as bad behavior at home. American bulldogs love brisk walks with their owners, and their enthusiastic personalities are great for playing with adults and kids alike.</p><h2>History of the American Bulldog</h2><p>English bulldogs were originally used for bull baiting in 17th century England, a gruesome sport involving dogs fighting bulls. The practice has since been eliminated, and bulldogs dazzled their way into the lives of families across England (even becoming a national symbol).</p><p>English bulldogs were brought to North America to use their strength and determination as farm dogs. Farmers bred them with other working dogs to get the best all-around breed for their specific jobs. Their intelligence, loyalty, and agility made them helpful for both herding and hunting.</p><p>According to the AKC, the American bulldog breed's population was severely depleted during WWI and WWII. Thanks to two determined breeders, John D. Johnson and Alan Scott, these dogs were repopulated and went on to become the popular companions they are today.</p><p>As the breed developed, American bulldogs were known as friendly pets that were a must for families across North America.

In the grooming department, these short-haired dogs don't require much aside from basic care.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>American bulldogs do best with at least an hour of exercise per day, which owners can provide through daily walks or playing in the yard. Along with helping your dog maintain its health and a suitable weight, exercise is a great way to keep this breed mentally stimulated.</p><p>Without enough exercise, American bulldogs are prone to find their own entertainment-which can lead to destructive behaviors like chewing on furniture or getting into off-limits items at home. This breed is best suited for active families that enjoy plenty of playtime with their dogs. Your American bulldog will be happy to join you on walks, runs, hikes, and games like fetch or tug-of-war.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Minimal grooming is required for the American bulldog's short, fine coat, but this breed does shed year-round. These dogs typically enjoy grooming, and weekly brushing will significantly help owners manage shedding.</p><p>Though their coat is relatively low-maintenance, American bulldogs are known to have issues with excess drool. Their slobber is natural; just be sure to keep any wrinkles free from excess moisture to avoid bacteria buildup or infections. Like other dogs, American bulldogs require regular baths, nail trimming, and ear cleaning. Their nails should be trimmed every few weeks to avoid overgrowth and pain, while ears should be cleaned as needed to prevent infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Consistent training is a must for this breed. American bulldogs are naturally protective (sometimes to a fault), but they do love to learn. Training your dog in basic obedience can begin as early as six to eight weeks of age, and socialization is necessary once puppies have received the necessary vaccines to be safe in public.</p><p>American bulldogs can need a helping hand when it comes to acceptable behavior around strangers and other animals. This will help your dog become a friendly companion and avoid unnecessary aggression. Since these dogs do best with love and attention from their owners, they also respond very well to positive reinforcement methods. Offer treats, affection, and playtime as rewards for desired behavior. Training should be consistent and ongoing throughout the dog's life.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like other purebred dogs, American bulldogs can be prone to certain genetic health concerns. Responsible breeders will test prospective parent dogs before breeding to avoid passing these problems down to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>American bulldogs do best on high-quality dog food with meat protein listed as the first ingredient. Avoid overfeeding to prevent unnecessary weight gain, which can cause joint issues. Your veterinarian may also recommend omega-3 fatty acids for joint health.</p><p>Along with maintaining the proper nutrients, it's important to be aware of any food allergies your dog may have if they struggle with red, itchy skin.

Tenacious, lively, and confident, the PON needs a dedicated owner willing to deal with their stubborn training temperament and high-maintenance fur. Still, if you power through and give them the training, exercise, and grooming they need, they'll be a fantastic companion and reliable worker suitable for many different homes.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 30 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat: Thick, long, and shaggy</p><p>Coat Color: Beige, black, black and white, brown, chocolate and white, gray, gray and white, tricolor, and white. </p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Confident, intelligent, lively, active, loyal, attentive, peaceful</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Poland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Polish Lowland Sheepdog</h2><p>Originally bred for herding livestock, the Polish Lowland sheepdog is an active and motivated breed that loves having a ""job"" to accomplish. Despite their high-maintenance coat, they are otherwise easy-to-care-for dogs, with a calm and vigilant disposition that makes them good companions.</p><h2>History of the Polish Lowland Sheepdog</h2><p>The PON originated in the region that eventually became Poland. Theory has it that, in the 1300s, Asian traders entered Eastern Europe and their dogs bred (like the Tibetan mastiff and Lhasa Apso) with the local dogs, creating the PON. The drive and dedication of the breed was the perfect medium-sized match for herding, as larger dogs frightened the sheep and were too aggressive with young lamps. Their work ethic and drive brought outside admirers and the PON was eventually crossed with Scottish herding dogs to create the Bearded Collie, which remains the more popular and accessible of the two. The Polish Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 1959; the American Kennel Club (AKC) officially recognized it in 2001.</p><h2>Polish Lowland Sheepdog Care</h2><p>Between stubbornness, high energy, and mop-like coat that requires daily grooming, a PON owner should be dedicated to spending a lot of time with their dog. But for the right family, the PON will become a hard working, loyal, and lovable companion.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like other dogs in the herding group, the PON is full of energy and needs appropriate outlets. Both physical and mental exercise are essential to preventing PONs from becoming bored and destructive. Their level of intelligence is high, and activities that require brainpower-like puzzle toys, agility, and nose work-are great tools for managing the PON's drive. They are happiest when exercised for no less than an hour daily. Taking your dog for long walks in nature and letting them sniff is a great way for both of you to relax. Most dogs are actually easier to live with after nature-filled sniffing walks than after pounding the pavement, so it's worth it to really head out and about and not just around the block.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>If you're looking for a low-maintenance grooming routine, the PON is not the right breed for you. The breed's characteristic long, thick, shaggy coat needs daily brushing to avoid matting. Though the fur is mostly water resistant, the long coat tends to pick up debris like sticks and dirt. The PON also has a dense undercoat, so seasonal shedding is to be expected.</p><p>Many owners trim the fur around their dog's eyes and ears at least. If you enjoy brushing your dog as a bonding activity, great. Otherwise, you may be able to find a regular groomer who will keep your PON's coat clipped short. Keep in mind, regular clipping will mean less brushing, but it also means regular paid trips to the groomer. Not brushing this dog isn't an option: Matting in the undercoat can be painful and nearly impossible to remove once it progresses.</p><p>It's important to care for other parts of your PON's grooming routine as well. Trim their nails once a month and clean their ears weekly, keeping an eye out for unusually redness or appearance that may signal an infection. You should also aim to brush your dog's teeth several times a week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Socialization and obedience training should begin early on in a PON's life. This breed has a tendency to be aloof and wary of strangers, so early socialization in puppyhood can help alleviate that. Though the PON is wickedly intelligent, they are equally as stubborn and require a patient but firm trainer. They can be very confident with other dogs as well, so they shouldn't be left unattended in spaces like dog parks where they can approach a less-than-friendly canine.</p><p>This dog's genetic material sets them up to be a watch dog, so be aware that you're working with genes that dictate your dog should be wary of strangers. Correcting your dog for this behavior is likely to make it worse. Instead, focus on rewarding your dog for good behavior and setting up situations where they're likely to succeed. If you're hitting a wall with stubbornness, reevaluate what you're offering as a reward for training. Trying to overpower your Polish lowland sheepdog with force or intimidation will likely harm your relationship and can backfire on training goals.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The PON is a relatively healthy breed with no major genetic concerns. Like most medium to large dogs, PONs should be monitored for signs of joint issues as they age, and highly active dogs should be examined for signs of stress injuries like muscle tears.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your PON should perform well on a high-quality dog food, either manufactured or prepared at home under veterinary supervision. PONs used for flock herding and sports may benefit from a high performance or working dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times for this active breed.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Polish Lowland Sheepdog</h2><p>If you want to adopt a PON, check your local animal shelter or look for a sheepdog rescue organization in your state. If you're going to rescue route, it's likely you won't find a pure bred PON, given the rarity of this breed. If this specific breed isn't available, they may be able to recommend another shelter or rescue organization with similar dogs waiting for their forever homes.</p><p>When buying a puppy from a breeder, it's essential to do your research. Responsible breeders do not produce new litters often and perform the necessary medical tests on both parents. Prospective adopters should be allowed to meet these parents and see that the dogs are kept in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Because PON puppies are relatively hard to come by, you may need to travel far or pay a premium to get one from a reputable breeder.</p><h2>Polish Lowland Sheepdog Overview</h2><p>Intelligent</p><p>Playful</p><p>Dedicated</p><p>Stubborn and can be difficult to train</p><p>Daily grooming required</p><p>Highly energetic</p>",1147

Known by its distinctive silver-tipped blue-gray coat and heart-shaped face, this cat has won countless admirers for its looks as well as its unique personality. It's considered a symbol of good luck in its native Thailand.</p><p>The Korat (pronounced as koh-raht, not core-rat) is a small-to-medium feline with a sturdy, strong build and lively, alert expression. Its large, prominent green or amber eyes amplify this breed's expressiveness. Korats are very intelligent, loyal, and sociable cats that enjoy spending time with their family, but they can demand attention.</p><p>Though fairly rare outside of its native Thai home, there's lots to learn and love about this affectionate cat breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Si-Sawat</p><p>Personality: Intelligent, social, friendly, demanding, affectionate</p><p>Weight: 6 to 10 pounds</p><p>Length: 15 to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Color: Blue-gray with silver tips</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid only</p><p>Eye Color: Green is preferred, amber is acceptable</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 19 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Thailand</p><h2>Korat Characteristics</h2><p>The lovely Korat doesn't reach full maturity until it's between two and four years of age. But even as an adult, it's not a very large cat, although it is muscular and solid. With its beautiful silvery-blue coat that almost appears to shimmer, this is a cat that demands attention, and indeed, the Korat considers itself to be in charge of its family.</p><p>Affectionate and very intelligent, Korats generally get along with adults and children alike, as long as they get plenty of attention on their own terms. While these rare felines generally interact well with other household pets, they can become jealous if they feel the other animal is taking away the recognition that they consider their due.</p><h2>History of the Korat</h2><p>This breed originated in Thailand, formerly known as Siam, where they are formally recognized as a national treasure. Literature indicates that the Korat may have been around as far back as Thailand's Ayutthaya period, which spanned 1350 to 1767. The most notable book from this time period, The Cat-Book Poems, depicted 17 cat breeds thought to bring luck to their owners. Among the cats listed was the Korat. Because of this, Korats were traditionally given as gifts to brides to bring luck and happiness to the newly married couple.</p><p>The Korat first came to the United States quite recently. In 1959, the first Korats, Nara, and Darra were imported from Thailand to the U.S. To this day, most Korat's lines can be traced back to their Thai roots. Unlike many other cat breeds, today's Korats still closely resemble their ancestors; the breed standards have not changed over time. Nor has the Korat been crossed with any other breed, making the Korat one of the few cat breeds to have remained pure throughout the centuries.</p><h2>Korat Cat Care</h2><p>The Korat cat is extremely intelligent, playful, and affectionate. These smart felines can form a close bond with their people and love to be an involved part of your daily activities. Because of this, they do not like to be left alone for long periods of time. They are social cats and love to be with their special person. These cats should have a companion to keep them company, whether that is you or another animal. Being left alone can lead to separation anxiety and an unhappy Korat. </p><p>Exercise is important for any cat, and the Korat is no exception. However, unlike some cats, the Korat loves any game they can play with their people. Playtime is bonding time, and these feisty cats soak up every minute of positive interaction with their human companions. Many Korats even enjoy a game of fetch! The Korat's high intelligence makes it easy to train them, as well. To keep them entertained and challenged, try teaching tricks and giving them puzzle toys. </p><p>Keeping your Korat well-groomed will ensure that it remains healthy and clean. With their single-layered short coat, grooming a Korat is a breeze. A weekly brushing or two should be sufficient to keep its shimmering silvery-blue fur shiny and in good condition. Be sure to also regularly trim your Korat's nails, brush its teeth, and keep its ears clean. </p><p>It's worth noting that this blue cat breed is also generally considered to be low-shedding. Simply stroking the fur of a well-groomed Korat is unlikely to produce the usual flurry of cat hair that can be problematic for many allergy-sufferers. However, they are not entirely hypoallergenic.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Korat is typically quite healthy, but before purchasing one from a breeder, be sure to see written documentation of the health of both parents. </p><p>They can be prone to GM1 and GM2 gangliosidosis. This is a rare genetic condition that results in an enzyme deficiency affecting the nervous system. It is fatal but can be discovered by means of genetic testing. It is important that a Korat cat is tested for this disease before breeding.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>These small-to-medium sized cats have a solid, muscular body that can weigh more than you'd expect. But the really striking thing about a Korat's appearance is its defining fur, which is a silvery blue without any stripes, white markings, or other colors anywhere on the adult cat's body, although faint tabby ""ghost"" markings are permitted on kittens. The skin on the animal's nose should be blue to lavender, as should the paw pads. The ideal eye color is bright green, but amber is also acceptable. The true eye color is not generally fully developed until the cat is two to four years old.</p><p>The head of a Korat is heart-shaped when viewed from the front, with somewhat large, erect ears that give the cat an alert appearance. Their eyes are also large relative to the size of their heads.</p><p>Although Korats have very sleek, short fur that isn't prone to much shedding, they are not truly hypoallergenic cats.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Providing your Korat with high-quality food will help ensure a long and healthy life. Every cat will have its own likes, dislikes, and dietary needs, but a good cat food formulated specifically for the dietary needs of felines should provide all the nutrients your pet needs to thrive. Consult your veterinarian for more information on the diet that best suits your feline.</p><p>Keep in mind that while this breed can struggle with a low percentage of body fat, you should also avoid encouraging excessive weight gain or obesity.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Korat Cat</h2><p>Finding a purebred Korat may be a bit trickier than some other breeds, but a thorough search is worth your effort! These rare cats are unlikely to end up in a shelter or rescue. Your best bet is to visit a cat show, where you'll be able to talk with breeders of many types of cats, possibly including Korats. You can also look for a breeder on The Cat Fancier Association website.</p><h2>Korat Overview</h2><p>If your dream cat is intelligent, playful, eager to be the center of attention, affectionate, and gorgeous, then a Korat may be the right breed for you. Granted, these cats are not easy to find, but for the lucky homes that are ruled by the furry paw of a Korat, they are well worth the trouble.</p><p>Extremely intelligent</p><p>Very loving and can form a strong bond with their people</p><p>Low grooming requirements</p><p>Can develop separation anxiety if left alone for long periods of time</p><p>May become vocally demanding</p>",1222

This breed makes a devoted companion that's equally content with hard work and family life. All spaniels were originally bred from the same lines, but the English cocker spaniel stands out today for its well-proportioned appearance and friendly disposition. With plenty of energy but a calm demeanor, the English cocker spaniel is a great family pet.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting   </p><p>Height: 16 to 17 inches (males); 15 to 16 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 28 to 34 pounds (males); 26 to 32 pounds (females)   </p><p>Coat: Medium-length silky coat with feathering on ears, legs, and torso</p><p>Coat Color: Solid or particolored with black, white, tan, blue roan, golden, lemon, liver, orange, red, sable, or lemon roan</p><p>Life Span: 12-14 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, playful, cheerful, trainable, even-tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the English Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>Known for their loving, affectionate personalities, English cocker spaniels are a great breed choice for homes with children. They do well with other dogs, and they also have a friendly temperament with cats when raised together (though it does have a prey drive for smaller animals). These sporting dogs have plenty of energy and need owners who are able to fulfill their exercise needs, whether it be on a hike, bike ride, run, or simply taking walks together. Your English cocker spaniel should learn basic obedience and even fun tricks with ease, as this breed's eagerness to please its owners and intelligence make it a pleasure to train.</p><h2>History of the English Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>The English cocker spaniel descends from a larger group of hunting dogs bred in Britain and beyond to be reliable and loyal field companions. Spaniels, whose early origins may date back as far as the 16th century, were particularly prized for their ability to assist with hunting game birds and waterfowl. Any given litter could produce both cocker spaniels smaller dogs adept at hunting woodcock birds and springer spaniels, prized for their ability to jump and ""spring"" birds from their hiding places. Initially, the only differentiation between the two classifications was based on the size of the dog.</p><p>In the 1890s, however, the spaniel family was split in two, with recognition for both the cocker spaniel and springer spaniel. The breeds were independently developed and bred. Within the cocker spaniel breed, further differentiation in type became evident. In the United States, a smaller, slightly blockier, and furrier version of the spaniel came into popularity. Termed the American cocker spaniel, these dogs stand in contrast to the slightly larger English spaniel bred with longer legs, a shorter back, and less fur.</p><p>In 1935, the split was made official when the AKC granted official recognition to the English cocker spaniel as an independent breed. Today, this devoted pet remains a popular dog on both sides of the pond. Even England's royal family appreciates the nobility of this breed: Prince William and Kate Middleton own an English cocker spaniel named Lupo, who was bred from a dog owned by her parents. </p><h2>English Cocker Spaniel Care</h2><p>English cocker spaniels aren't high-maintenance dogs, but they do require some special consideration to be happy, healthy pets. While they're easy to train, they need plenty of exercise to stay well-mannered at home, and their silky coats require consistent grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As part of the sporting group, these dogs have seemingly tireless energy and need an outlet for it. Plan to give your English cocker spaniel about an hour and a half of exercise each day in the form of lengthy walks, running, and playing outside. Without adequate exercise, these dogs can become anxious or destructive. While your English cocker spaniel can keep up with you for hours on end, this breed will also be happy to rest and relax inside the home after being active.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Aside from daily exercise, regular grooming is likely the biggest investment of time you'll make in your English cocker spaniel. The medium-length silky hair that gives these dogs such a beautiful coat can easily become matted. It also is subject to shedding.</p><p>The more you can brush and maintain the coat, the easier it is to control excessive shedding. To keep the coat looking its best, most owners of English cocker spaniels take their dog to a groomer on a recurring basis. The hair around the legs and torso often needs to be trimmed to avoid becoming unruly.</p><p>You'll also need to brush your spaniel's teeth, trim their nails, and regularly check their ears for strange odors or excessive wax buildup. Dirt and bacteria can become trapped inside the ear canal, and these dogs are sometimes prone to ear infections as a result.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>English cocker spaniels are eager to please their owners, so training is usually not too difficult with this breed. Basic obedience lessons can begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. However, they have a sensitive nature and need plenty of positive reinforcement. Harsh training methods can cause fear and anxiety, and may contribute to undesirable behaviors like submissive urination or separation anxiety. If you're a hunter, these sporting dogs seem to be naturals at their job and understand their role with relative ease.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like other purebred dogs, English cocker spaniels can be prone to inherited health problems. Responsible breeders test prospective parent dogs for genetic issues before breeding.</p><p>To minimize the probability of adopting a dog with any of these health problems, research breeders that provide tests on each parent dog for the hips and knees from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals and tests from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation. There also is a test for hearing available from the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals that measures brainstem audiotry evoked response (BAER) and may be important if you're considering a particolored English cocker spaniel.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your English cocker spaniel a well-balanced and nutritionally complete dog food twice per day. Whether you choose a conventional kibble diet, incorporate wet food, or opt for a raw diet, look for indications of an allergic reaction, which is common for some spaniels. If your dog has food allergies or sensitivities, you might opt for a limited-ingredient diet.</p><p>Keep a close eye on the weight of your English cocker spaniel. The breed can be prone to obesity if overfed and under-exercised. Ask your veterinarian to help you determine a healthy meal plan based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an English Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>When searching for an English cocker spaniel, first consider contacting rescue groups in your area. A surprising number of purebred dogs end up in shelters and rescues because of owner circumstances. Your local shelter may also have similar spaniels in need of forever homes.</p><p>If you do opt to purchase a puppy from a breeder, be wary of backyard breeders. Instead, look for breeders that can provide health clearances for the parents of a litter and extensive information on your prospective puppy. These puppies can cost anywhere from $800 to $2,000, but prices can be higher depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>English Cocker Spaniel Overview</h2><p>Loyal, kid-friendly companion</p><p>Trainable and eager to please owners</p><p>Eager and able to perform many different jobs</p><p>Needs consistent grooming, sheds significantly</p><p>Can become destructive or anxious when left alone</p><p>Requires considerable daily exercise</p>",1209

A quintessential water dog, barbets were originally bred hundreds of years ago to hunt birds and waterfowl throughout Europe. Today's barbets are hard to find, but they are beginning to increase in numbers it's estimated that there are only about 500 barbets in the United States and about 2,000 across North America. Modern-day barbets have maintained their ancestors' athleticism, intelligence, and calm demeanor, making them excellent for families with kids or other pets and they're still excellent hunters, too.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 19 to 24.5 inches from the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 35 to 65 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, dense, curly</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, grey, brown, or fawn, and some have white markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Calm, goofy, devoted, intelligent, obedient, joyful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Barbet</h2><p>Barbets love their humans and need constant attention from them so they may be susceptible to separation anxiety. Excessive drooling, accidents in the house, and destructive behavior can be signs of the condition. Talk to your vet about ways to ease separation anxiety through training or medication for severe cases.</p><h2>History of the Barbet</h2><p>A close relative to the poodle and the briard, the barbet originated in France as a bird and waterfowl hunting dog. The barbet's webbed paws enabled him to pursue birds into mud and water, earning him the nickname ""mud dog."" The barbet's real name, however, comes from the French word ""barbe,"" which means ""beard.""</p><p>The barbet has a long, varied history throughout Europe. The first written description of the breed appeared in literature in 1387, but some believe barbets originated as early as the 8th century. It's also said that King Henry IV kept barbets as his companions, and his mistress once got into trouble for bringing a barbet into church.</p><p>Although barbets served as loyal hunting dogs and companions for centuries, they're a fairly rare breed today. Despite their smaller populations globally, the barbet ranks as one of the top agility dogs in French dog competitions.</p><p>The barbet is a newer breed fully recognized by the American Kennel Club. The breed was classified in 2020 as a member of the ""Sporting Group"" by the AKC.</p><h2>Barbet Care</h2><p>It's important to make sure you can manage a barbet's high-maintenance grooming, exercise, and training needs before bringing one home. Because the barbet has a curly, dense coat, shedding is minimal but daily grooming is a must. Due to their grooming requirements, high intelligence (and potential for stubbornness), a barbet may not be the right dog for a first-time dog owner, families with extremely busy schedules, or inactive families.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Barbets are sporting dogs so they have higher energy levels and exercise needs. It's important to walk and run these dogs for at least two hours a day. They're highly intelligent dogs so it's important to keep them engaged and entertained. They thrive in agility sports, so agility games, puzzles, or other challenging games will keep your barbet engaged and exercised.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because barbets have long, dense, curly coats, daily grooming is an absolute must. Their coats are highly susceptible to tangles, mats, and a build-up of debris. You may even find debris in your barbet's coat after each walk. If left ungroomed, the barbet's coat can easily become matted or felted and grow to long and unruly lengths. Each day, gently brush and comb your barbet's coat and remove any mats or tangles with your fingers. Removing a mat with a comb runs the risk of tearing your dog's coat or injuring his skin.</p><p>Some barbet owners prefer to keep their dogs' coats shorter to make grooming easier. If you choose to trim your barbet's coat, aim for about 4 inches in length around the body, and slightly longer on the head, chin, and tail. You can clip the hairs between your dog's eyes regularly, so he can see more clearly, as well as the hairs around the ear canal. If you don't feel comfortable trimming your dog's coat, a local groomer will be able to help.</p><p>Inspect your barbet's ears regularly, and gently remove any waxy build-up or debris with a soft cotton cloth. If your dog's ears are red and inflamed, are excessively dirty, or smell funny, make an appointment with your vet. These may be signs of infection and could require treatment.</p><p>All dog breeds are susceptible to periodontal disease if they don't receive proper dental care. Daily teeth brushing is ideal, but brushing your dog's teeth at least once per week can help prevent oral diseases from developing. You can also supplement brushing with dental chew treats, but remember: They're empty calories, so it's important to give them in moderation. Dental treats should never be your dog's only form of dental hygiene.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Because barbets are extremely intelligent, they have the potential for stubbornness. Obedience training, as well as regular exercise and entertainment, can help. Although the barbet is loving and loyal to its family, it may not be so friendly towards strangers. Ongoing obedience training and proper socialization can help.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although barbets are generally healthy dogs, there's no guarantee that certain health conditions won't arise.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your dog's diet depends largely on its size, weight, activity levels, and metabolism, but generally, you can expect to feed your barbet 1.5 to 2 cups of high-quality, high-protein dog food each day. If you're not sure how much to feed your barbet, your veterinarian can help develop a meal plan that works for your dog.</p><p>All breeds are susceptible to canine obesity if overfed and under-exercised. Obesity can lead to serious health complications like heart disease, diabetes, and joint problems, so it's important to make sure your dog is eating a healthy, balanced diet.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Barbet</h2><p>It's highly unlikely that you'll find a barbet at your local shelter. If you choose to purchase a barbet from a breeder, do your research to ensure you're working with a reputable, ethical breeder. If possible, visit the breeder's home or breeding facility, so you can see where their dogs are kept, whether or not they're healthy, and the cleanliness and safety of the location. Be on the lookout for signs of a ""backyard breeding"" situation, like unhealthy animals, crowded facilities, or discounted puppies.</p><p>Don't be afraid to ask questions reputable breeders want what's best for their dogs, and should willingly answer any questions or concerns you may have.</p><p>Begin your search for a breeder with the Barbet Club of America. The organization does warn potential barbet owners that they may need to wait a year or more for an available puppy. And, you should be prepared to pay about $2,500 to $4,000 per pup. In addition, the club has an arm that handles isolated cases of a barbet that needs to be rescued and rehomed.</p><h2>Barbet Overview</h2><p>Loving and loyal to family members</p><p>Does well in homes with other pets</p><p>Doesn't shed excessively</p><p>High energy with high exercise requirements</p><p>Not suitable for apartment living</p><p>Requires daily grooming</p>",1155

In addition to their striking appearance as one of the few naturally spotted cat breeds in the world, Egyptian maus are friendly and interactive with their family members.

Egyptian maus can make wonderful additions to homes willing to make them an integral part of the family.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>PERSONALITY: Playful, active, devoted, loyal, alert, affectionate on their own terms</p><p>WEIGHT: 6 to 14 pounds</p><p>HEIGHT: 8 to 14 inches </p><p>LENGTH: Up to 16 inches</p><p>COAT: Medium-length shorthair, may be silky and fine or dense, depending on color.</p><p>COAT COLOR: Silver, bronze, or smoke with dark spots of varying sizes that occur only on the tips of the fur.

Egyptian art dating back to 1900 BCE depicted cats with similar spotted markings in the homes of Egyptians, and by 1450 BCE cats were commonly shown in many domestic situations, where it was likely that they formed close, mutually beneficial relationships with humans. Cats also became associated with the Egyptian goddess Bastet. The worship of Bastet remained popular during the Roman rule of Egypt, and it is likely that Romans took some of these eye-catching spotted cats back to Italy. In this way, the precursors of the Egyptian mau breed ended up in Europe.</p><p>Cats resembling the Egyptian mau were bred in Italy, Switzerland, and France in the early 20th century, but the breed declined during World War II and may have died out, were it not for the work of a Russian-born nurse living in Rome in the 1950s. The nurse, Nathalie Troubetskoy, was given a silver-spotted kitten that purportedly came from an embassy in Rome. She discovered that the kitten was an Egyptian mau, and she was so taken by the beauty and personality of the cat that she became determined to revive the breed. </p><p>Troubetskoy managed to acquire a male cat named Gregorio, along with her silver cat Lulu, and later imported additional cats from the Middle East, including Geppa, a male smoke-colored cat. She produced the first litter of Egyptian mau in 1956. In 1968, the breed was recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association and the Canadian Cat Association. <br/><p>Egyptian maus remain a rare breed and there may be only around 3,000 worldwide. The Middle Eastern origin of the Egyptian mau  was confirmed in a 2012 genetic analysis that connected the breed to other Middle Eastern cats like the Turkish van.<br/></p><h2>Egyptian Mau Care</h2><p>Egyptian maus are intelligent, highly active, and playful cats who require lots of stimulation in their environment. Like all cats, feeding them a high-quality diet, minimizing their stress, and getting them regular preventive veterinary care will help them have long, healthy lives. Spaying, neutering, vaccinating and keeping them indoors with plenty of activities and interaction will result in happy and healthy cats.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>They are moderate shedders and don't require extensive grooming. Brushing them regularly will help with any shedding and will also prevent them from ingesting large amounts of hair via grooming which can lead to hairballs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed requires frequent exercise and opportunities to run, jump, and climb. Tall cat trees, scratching posts, toys, and safe indoor places to run and climb should be available to them. They enjoy interactive play with people, and can be taught to fetch toys and walk with secure leashes and harnesses. They are often conversational, with a variety of vocalizations that include chirping, chortling, and meowing. </p><p><br/>Egyptian maus enjoy water, and like all cats, they should have a continuous source of fresh water available. Water fountains can not only provide them incentive to drink water more often, but also offer entertainment opportunities for them to splash and play.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Because Egyptian maus come from a limited genetic background in the US, they may develop health issues like kidney disease, bladder stones, and lower urinary tract disease. </p><p><br/>Egyptian maus may also be prone to a heart condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which can shorten their lifespan. Depending on severity, this condition can be managed with medications, and regular veterinary examinations are crucial to monitor for the development of this disease. </p><p><br/>They may also experience dental disease and gingivitis, and it's important to brush their teeth regularly with a cat-friendly toothpaste and have their teeth cleaned periodically by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Egyptian maus have several unusual characteristics that make their appearance unique among cat breeds. Their spots are naturally-occurring and appear in random patterns on their coat. While the only colors accepted by the Cat Fanciers' Association are smoke, bronze, and silver, they can also be found in black, blue, and caramel colors. </p><p><br/>They have a distinctive ""M"" or scarab shape on the top of their heads, and ""mascara"" lines that run from the corners of their eyes to their cheeks. Their tails are heavily banded with a dark tip and a dorsal stripe that runs the length of the tail. The overall coat pattern of the Egyptian mau is tabby. Smoke-colored cats generally have finer fur than the other colors. </p><p><br/>They have short hair on their ears that may be tufted at the tip of the ears. Their eyes are a striking light green called ""gooseberry,"" and they are often described as having a slightly worried look. </p><p><br/>They are fast, athletic cats with well-developed muscles. Males are generally larger than females. Their hind legs are longer than their front legs, giving them a ""tiptoe"" stance. They have a skinfold from their flank to knees, a trait shared with cheetahs that may relate to their speed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Egyptian maus should be fed a high-quality diet that includes both wet and dry food. A veterinarian can help determine the best diet for an individual cat, based on lifestyle and activity level. Certain medical conditions may require that specialized diets be fed.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt an Egyptian Mau</h2><p>Egyptian maus are not very common, and finding one to adopt may require patience and persistence. You can search for the breed on sites like Adopt-A-Pet and Petfinder, or contact breed-specific cat rescue organizations in your area.<br/></p><h2>Egyptian Mau Overview</h2><p>Active and intelligent</p><p>Bonds strongly to family members</p><p>Doesn't require extensive grooming</p><p>Rare and not commonly found for adoption</p><p>Health issues like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</p><p>May be too high energy for some homes</p>",1216

Also known as Italian Pointers or Italian Pointing Dogs, these talented hunters are popular in their home country but rare in the United States. One of only two gun dogs native to Italy (the other is the Spinone Italiano), the Bracco Italiano is classified as a versatile hunting breed.</p><p>The Bracco Italiano is equally skilled at all aspects of bird hunting: scenting birds in the field, pointing them out, and retrieving downed birds to the hunter. Their white coats can be speckled or marked with orange and chestnut. While these dogs are great on the hunt, they also make beloved companions at home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 21 to 27 inches</p><p>Weight: 55 to 90 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, dense, and smooth fur</p><p>Coat Color: White, white and orange, or white and chestnut</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, intelligent, active, stubborn, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bracco Italiano</h2><p>The Bracco Italiano loves to hunt. In fact, its instincts are so ingrained that providing the Bracco with a hunting home is almost a prerequisite to owning this breed. These dogs are slow, methodical hunters. The Bracco has an exceptional nose, is a great retriever, and has a very soft mouth (a term that refers to its ability to retrieve and carry birds without damaging them). </p><p>At home, this gentle-natured dog forms a strong bond with its owners and needs to be included as part of the family. Bracco Italianos tend to get along well with dogs and other household pets when socialized properly, and they're known for having loving personalities toward children. Since this breed is large, adults should always supervise its interactions with young kids. When provided with the proper exercise and mental stimulation each day especially when it's able to hunt the Bracco Italiano has a gentle and well-mannered temperament in the house.<br/></p><h2>History of the Bracco Italiano</h2><p>The Bracco Italiano originated in Northern Italy. In fact, its name translates to ""Italian hound."" It has been registered with an official breed standard since 1949, but its roots go back as far as the 4th and 5th centuries B.C. When it was first bred, two types existed simultaneously, including white-and-orange dogs in the Piedmont area and roan-and-brown dogs in the Lombardy area. When the Bracco Italiano neared extinction in the late 1800s, dedicated enthusiasts repopulated the breed. During that process, they brought the two varieties together. </p><p>The first Bracchi Italiani (the Italian plural spelling of its name) didn't step onto American soil until the 1990s. The Bracco Italiano Club of America was formed in 2007. These dogs are part of the American Kennel Club's Miscellaneous Class, which is a stepping stone toward full recognition, though the breed is closest to the Sporting Group. The Bracco Italiano is also recognized as part of the Gun Dog Group in the United Kennel Club.</p><h2>Bracco Italiano Care</h2><p>The Bracco Italiano is a high-energy dog with considerable exercise needs each day. Thankfully, as long as owners keep these dogs active, their grooming and training requirements are typically easy to fulfill.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These large, athletic dogs have the strength and endurance to work all day in the field, but with enough regular exercise, the Bracco Italiano is calm and obedient in the home. Owners should plan for at least two hours per day of vigorous activities like hunting when possible, but other options like walking, jogging, and swimming can suffice as well. Without enough exercise and work which can include any activity that engages their instincts and skills the Bracco Italiano may become bored and destructive inside the home.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Bracco Italiano's short, glossy coat is easy to care for. Brush your dog a few times each week using a de-shedding glove or a boar-bristle brush to remove loose hair. This breed is also known for excessive drooling, so it's not the best choice for owners that can't tolerate this messy habit.</p><p>Since the Bracco Italiano has such long ears, it's more prone to ear infections than those with short or upright ears. Floppy ears trap in moisture, so owners need to be proactive by checking them weekly and cleaning the ears anytime dirt and debris build up inside. Use a pet-safe ear cleaner with a cotton ball, avoiding cotton swabs that can damage the delicate inner ear structure. Owners should also trim the nails and brush the teeth regularly.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Bracco Italiano is loyal and willing to please. These dogs can be quite trainable aside from occasional stubbornness, but it's important for owners to know that they don't do well with harsh training techniques involving punishment. Instead, this friendly hunter's sensitive side responds best to positive reinforcement with repetition and gentle delivery. Reward your dog with treats, affection, and playtime for desirable behaviors and provide consistency.</p><p>Basic obedience lessons should begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. If you intend to hunt with your Bracco Italiano, start training early with lots of bird exposure. In addition to hunting, this breed excels at field trials, tracking, and nose work.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Bracco Italiano is a relatively healthy breed. However, like most purebred dogs, it's still susceptible to a few inherited health conditions. Reputable breeders test their adult dogs for genetic issues before breeding to avoid passing problems down to puppies. When buying a Bracco Italiano puppy from a breeder, always ask for clear test results from both parents. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The large and active Bracco Italiano needs a lot of fuel and tends to eat a lot. Dogs that hunt regularly and get plenty of exercise can have difficulty keeping weight on their large frames. A high-quality, calorie-dense food can help in these cases. On the flip side, a Bracco that doesn't exercise as much should be fed carefully measured meals to avoid excess weight gain. Too much weight can contribute to joint issues like hip dysplasia and health conditions like diabetes.</p><p>If you're unsure how much to feed your dog, the best option is to talk to your veterinarian. They can work together with you to create a healthy diet and portion plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bracco Italiano</h2><p>If you're looking for a beautiful, unique, and exceptionally skilled hunting dog, the Bracco Italiano might be right for you. Those who choose to bring a Bracco into their lives will find unparalleled loyalty, love, and affection. Since this is a rare breed in the United States, it's not likely to find these dogs in local shelters, but the national breed club offers rescue options to adopt a Bracco in need of a forever home.</p><p>To adopt a puppy from a breeder, it's important to do your research first. Ensure that your breeder provides the litter's medical background, allows you to meet their parents, and shows you that the dogs are raised in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Puppies from breeders typically cost between $1,200 and $2,500, tending toward the higher end based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Bracco Italiano Overview</h2><p>Excellent hunter</p><p>Loving and loyal family companion</p><p>Unique and attractive </p><p>Tendency to drool and bark often</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise; best for hunting homes</p><p>Can become destructive without enough exercise and engagement</p>",1204

Affectionately referred to as ""Beardies,"" these Collies are highly energetic, intelligent working dogs that were originally bred to herd sheep in Scotland.</p><p>Recognizable by their long, thick, shaggy coats that form a beard at the muzzle, Bearded Collies can come in a variety of colors. Because of their unique coats and the breed's intelligence, Bearded Collies make excellent show dogs. They are also popular family pets for owners that can keep up with their grooming and exercise needs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 21 to 22 inches (males); 20 to 21 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 45 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double coat with straight, coarse, shaggy outercoat and soft undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, blue, brown, or fawn; Commonly fades to white or silver markings as the dog ages</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, alert, friendly, energetic, bright</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Scotland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bearded Collie</h2><p>Bearded Collies are bright, loyal dogs that love to be part of a family. This breed is known for having a spunky and playful personality that is especially evident through its signature ""Beardie bounce,"" as these dogs jump up and down on their front feet when excited. Their bouncy nature carries over to their temperament with people and other animals, often enthusiastic to make new friends. While they make great family dogs for kids, Bearded Collies are still a herding breed, and they require plenty of physical and mental stimulation each day to stay happy. This breed is a great choice for active owners who spend plenty of time with their dogs and can tolerate stray fur around the house from their long, shaggy coats.</p><h2>History of the Bearded Collie</h2><p>Although the Bearded Collie is one of the oldest breeds in Europe, its name has changed over time. These dogs have also been known as the Highland Collie or Mountain Collie. Because farmers have bred herding dogs for centuries, the exact origin of Bearded Collies is unknown, but it's believed to date back to 1500s Scotland. Shaggy, long-haired working dogs were depicted in two pieces of artwork from the 1700s, which are considered the first visual depictions of the Bearded Collie.</p><p>Today's Bearded Collies were developed by G.O. Willison, who began breeding them for dog shows after World War II. She's also credited in helping develop the Bearded Collie Club in Britain, which propelled the breed to popularity around Europe.</p><p>Bearded Collies arrived in the United States sometime during the late 1950s, but the first litter of puppies wasn't born until 1967. In 1969, the Bearded Collie Club of America was formed, and the breed was registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1977.</p><h2>Bearded Collie Care</h2><p>Since it was originally bred to work in cold, harsh climates, the Bearded Collie's exercise and grooming needs make it fairly high-maintenance in standard homes (especially for first-time dog owners). These dogs will find ways to make their own fun if not entertained regularly, so their families should be prepared for consistent and ongoing training to raise a well-behaved Bearded Collie.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bearded Collies may appear smaller than some other herding dogs, but don't let their slight stature fool you. Like other working breeds, they are athletic and muscular. Owners need to provide one to two hours per day of exercise in the form of walks, runs, bike rides, hikes, agility training, or other high-energy activities.</p><p>Although a Bearded Collie may be comfortable in an apartment with plenty of exercise outside the house, this breed is better suited for a single-family home with a large yard to run around. Additionally, families with busy schedules or those who are away from the house often might not be best for a Bearded Collie they need a lot of attention to thrive.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because Bearded Collies have long, thick, shaggy coats with a softer undercoat, they require a few minutes of brushing with a bristle or pin brush daily. They also require routine grooming weekly to help prevent tangles and mats to keep their coat shiny and healthy. Any tangles should first be sprayed with detangling spray and gently combed out with the owner's fingers or a wide-toothed comb, then brushed to smooth the hair. Removing tangles with only a brush can worsen them or harm your dog's coat and skin.</p><p>Bearded Collies shed heavily for two to four weeks every year, so you'll probably want to increase the frequency of grooming during this time. This can help prevent stray fur around the house.</p><p>Examine your Bearded Collie's ears once a week, gently cleaning them with ear cleaning solution and a cotton pad if dirt and debris are present. Avoid cotton swabs, as they can damage the delicate inner-ear structures. If your Beardie's ears are excessively dirty, red, inflamed, or smell funny, contact your vet immediately to treat the possible ear infection.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Since Bearded Collies are extremely intelligent, high-energy dogs, ongoing obedience training is a must. Basic lessons can begin when puppies are eight weeks old. Bearded Collies have minds of their own and can be stubborn so starting early will help your dog learn appropriate behaviors. These lessons should be interesting to stimulate your dog's mind. Positive reinforcement with treats or playtime as rewards can keep your Beardie engaged.</p><p>This breed's energy level makes it ideal for active households with large outdoor spaces for running or playing fetch. Bearded Collies are excellent with children and can make perfect playmates for high-energy kids but it's important to teach young kids how to approach and handle the dog. Like any breed, kids shouldn't be left unsupervised with Beardies at playtime.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Bearded Collies are generally healthy dogs, but like all purebreds, they can be susceptible to inherited health issues. Responsible breeders will test parent dogs for genetic conditions before breeding to avoid passing problems down to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Bearded Collie a high-quality dog food at least twice a day. These active dogs do best on diets high in protein, but specific nutrient needs can vary depending on their age, activity level, and metabolism.</p><p>Like all dog breeds, Bearded Collies can become overweight or obese if they're overfed and under-exercised. If you're not sure how much to feed your Bearded Collie or which food is best, talk to your veterinarian to determine a healthy meal plan. Very active dogs can have a few extra treats, but overall, they should be given in moderation.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bearded Collie</h2><p>If you want to adopt a Bearded Collie, check your local animal shelter or look for a Bearded Collie rescue organization in your state. If this specific breed isn't available, they may be able to recommend another shelter or rescue organization with similar dogs waiting for their forever homes.</p><p>When adopting a puppy from a breeder, it's essential to do your research. Responsible breeders do not produce new litters often and perform the necessary medical tests on both parents. Prospective adopters should be allowed to meet these parents and see that the dogs are kept in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $2,500, but prices may vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Bearded Collie Overview</h2><p>Highly intelligent, loyal, and loving</p><p>Kid- and pet-friendly</p><p>Great companion for active owners</p><p>High energy and exercise requirements</p><p>Not suitable for apartment living</p><p>Requires frequent grooming</p>",1217

This well-proportioned and agile breed typically has particolored fur with a white base and black or tan markings. The tail is abundantly covered in hair, which creates a feathery look known as a plume tail. The tail hangs low when resting, but it raises over the back when the dog moves.</p><p>This ancient shepherd breed was on the verge of extinction until some dedicated breed fanciers revived it in the 1970s. While it has been preserved, the Tornjak is still an extremely rare dog breed. Owners of these unique canines will find that their relaxed, even-tempered nature is also a striking contrast to their extremely protective instincts.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Guardian Dog (UKC)</p><p>Height: 23 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 62 to 110 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double coat with long, thick, coarse, and straight fur</p><p>Coat Color: White, sometimes with black or tan markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Calm, alert, even-tempered, protective, obedient</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Tornjak</h2><p>The Tornjak is an intelligent, highly trainable, and very obedient dog. Full of dignity and self-confidence, this breed's calm demeanor combines with a steady disposition. Tornjaks have friendly personalities and are extremely devoted to their immediate families. These dogs are known to bestow abundant affection on their people, but they're also very wary of strangers especially anyone the dog believes to be threatening. Owners of this breed should be aware that it's courageous in the face of danger and fiercely protects its flock. The Tornjak acts with swift and appropriate aggression when warranted, but at home, it's laid-back and relaxed.</p><p>The Tornjak is protective of livestock thanks to its origins as a guardian breed, but it can become aggressive with other dogs (especially those it doesn't know). Some Tornjaks may get along with a family cat, though not all will be able to live with cats peacefully. While this breed is certainly not for everyone, it makes an especially devoted companion for the right owners.</p><h2>History of the Tornjak</h2><p>The Tornjak, also known as the Bosnian-Herzegovinian and Croatian Shepherd Dog, existed in the mountains and valleys of this region as far back as 1067. It is believed that the Tornjak is directly related to the Tibetan Mastiff. This breed watched over flocks of sheep and worked to protect its family and homestead from invaders, whether animal or human. </p><p>By the 1970s, the Tornjak breed was on the brink of extinction. It was saved and painstakingly repopulated by dedicated breeders in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia. By 1978, the Tornjak was revived, and breeding programs continued to preserve the breed. It was accepted by the international Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI) in 2017. In the United States, the Tornjak was recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC) 2011. It is currently part of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service. The Tornjak is still extremely rare, especially outside of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Croatia.</p><h2>Tornjak Care</h2><p>Similar to other guardian breeds, the Tornjak requires more training than exercise. These large dogs are content to patrol the property of their homesteads each day. Tornjaks that live indoors will need more regular brushings than those that live outside guarding livestock, but overall, this breed's grooming needs are average.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Tornjaks are large, but they only need a moderate amount of exercise to stay happy and healthy. About 45 minutes of activity per day should suffice. These dogs do best when they're able to follow their instincts, thriving on large, rural properties with plenty of time spent outdoors. Tornjaks enjoy exploring and keeping a watchful eye on their homes, families, and other animals. Owners can also bring these dogs along for activities like walking, hiking, and swimming.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Tornjak's long double coat is relatively easy to care for. Owners should keep up with weekly brush-outs and occasional baths. If your Tornjak spends a lot of time indoors, you might prefer daily brushings to reduce shedding around the house.</p><p>Like other dog breeds, Tornjaks also need to have their nails trimmed, teeth brushed, and ears cleaned on a regular basis. Dogs that are regularly outside in harsh conditions like rain and snow will likely need their ears checked more often to prevent moisture from building up, which can lead to infections. Clean the ears a few times each month and take your dog to the veterinarian if you notice any signs of infection like redness, swelling, or unusual odor.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed is extremely smart and highly trainable. Capable of learning many tasks and happy to perform them, your Tornjak should begin obedience lessons in puppyhood at around eight weeks of age. Once they've got the basics down, these dogs excel at more advanced training. Positive reinforcement methods are best for owners to build trust with these large, powerful dogs.</p><p>Since this breed is naturally suspicious of strangers, it's essential for owners to provide puppies with lots of socialization early on. Introduce your Tornjak to other dogs, cats, and new people to help prevent aggression. With proper socialization, this breed can grow up to be discerning yet accepting of friendly visitors.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Tornjak is exceptionally healthy and hardy, with few inherited health conditions known to plague the breed. However, like most purebreds, it is still susceptible to a few common problems (even if rarely seen). The Tornjak also boasts a typical lifespan of 12 to 14 years, which is a fairly long life for a large breed. Reputable Tornjak breeders are committed to making the health of their dogs a priority.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Tornjak is a large breed; some can weigh 100 pounds or more. However, this dog's moderate exercise requirements mean that it may need to eat less than you think. Active dogs will require more calories per day, while those that exercise moderately need less. Owners should keep a close eye on their dog to prevent excess weight gain or canine obesity, which puts more stress on the joints and can lead to other health problems like diabetes.</p><p>Since this breed is prone to Bloat, it's best to feed your Tornjak at least two smaller meals per day rather than one large portion. Owners can also use slow-feeder bowls to prevent the dog from eating too quickly, and exercise should be limited before and after meals. Ask your breeder to help you determine a healthy diet and portion plan for your Tornjak based on the dog's age, weight, and activity level.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Tornjak</h2><p>The Tornjak is extremely rare, especially in North America. Prospective adopters are not likely to find a Tornjak available for adoption through an animal shelter or rescue group, but local shelters may introduce them to similar guardian breeds in need of forever homes.</p><p>To purchase a puppy from a responsible breeder, it's essential to do your research and ensure the parent dogs have been screened for genetic health problems. For very rare breeds like the Tornjak, the only option may be to import a puppy from one of its home countries. These puppies typically cost between $800 and $1,500 depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Tornjak Overview</h2><p>Highly trainable<br/></p><p>Loyal and protective<br/></p><p>Effective flock guardian</p><p>Very rare, hard to find<br/></p><p>Needs thorough and ongoing socialization  <br/></p><p>May not get along with other pets</p>",1213

Standard poodles are most commonly used. Some breeders use Miniature or toy poodles to create smaller Bernedoodles. Crossing giant breeds with small breeds is risky and must be done carefully to avoid complications in the breeding mother or in the resulting puppies. Depending on their size, Bernedoodles are typically classified as standard, miniature, or tiny. <br/></p><p>Some people believe that Bernedoodles are hypoallergenic, but this is not always the case. Some Bernedoodles shed and mat a lot, some shed moderately, and some shed very little or not at all. The higher the percentage of poodle in the mix, the better the likelihood of a low-shedding coat. Depending on the nature of an individual Bernedoodle's coat, it may be less likely to cause issues in people with dog allergies. Before bringing home a Bernedoodle, allergic people should spend time with the dog in question to be sure the dog doesn't elicit allergy symptoms.<br/></p><p>People who breed Bernedoodles say that you get the best of both worlds: a calm, loyal, intelligent, trainable dog with a non-shedding coat. In reality, Bernedoodles' temperamental and physical traits are highly variable. Some Bernedoodles are outgoing and some are reserved with strangers. Some Bernedoodles are hyperactive rather than calm. Some are stubborn, which makes training difficult. Every Bernedoodle is an individual with a unique personality. <br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hybrid</p><p>Weight: Standard: 50 to 90 pounds; miniature: 25 to 49 pounds; tiny: 10 to 24 pounds.</p><p>Height: Standard: 23 to 29 inches tall at the shoulder; miniature: 18 to 22 inches; tiny: 12 to 17 inches.</p><p>Coat: Variable; usually wavy to curly. </p><p>Color: Variable; the most common colors are black, black and white, black and brown, or tri-color.</p><p>Life Expectancy: Variable depending on size; generally 12 to 17 years.</p><h3>History of the Bernedoodle</h3><p>Bernedoodles were first created in the early 2000s, following in the wake of the ""doodle"" craze that swept the world after the Labradoodle came on the scene in the 1990s. Although it's possible the first Bernedoodles may have been the result of accidental breeding, a few breeders began intentionally crossing Bernese mountain dogs and poodles.<br/></p><p>Purebreds have been bred for generations following a special blueprint the breed standard, which is the written description of the ideal physical and temperamental traits of the breed. For this reason, purebred dogs are very standardized, with predictable height and weight, body structure, color, coat type, and temperament. Because the Bernedoodle is a hybrid and not a purebred dog, it is not recognized by any of the reputable purebred dog registries such as the American Kennel Club or United Kennel Club. The Bernedoodle also does not have an official breed standard, so there is a lot of variation in how individual Bernedoodles look and act. Different breeders may have different ideas of what makes a Bernedoodle, so it's hard to know what you might get if you buy a Bernedoodle puppy.<br/></p><p>Bernedoodles may be first generation crosses (called F1), second generation (F2), third generation (F3) and so on. An F1 Bernedoodle is a 50-50 cross between a purebred Bernese Mountain Dog and a purebred poodle. The resulting puppies in an F1 litter are quite variable. Some may look more like Bernese Mountain Dogs and some may look more like pooodles. Some puppies might look like a mix between the two parent breeds, and some might look nothing like either parent breed. Coat type and level of shedding can be all over the map in a litter of F1 Bernedoodle puppies.<br/></p><p>F2 Bernedoodles result by crossing two F1 Bernedoodles. F2 Bernedoodles also have variable coat types. Some breeders introduce more poodle into the bloodlines to help achieve more consistency in coat type. This is called backcrossing and is indicated by a B (for instance, F2B). Bernedoodles that are 25% Bernese Mountain Dog and 75% poodle are more likely to have a low or nonshedding coat.</p><h3>Bernedoodle Care</h3><p>Grooming requirements for the Bernedoodle vary depending on the type of coat. Although most Bernedoodles have wavy to curly coats, some have straighter coats. Coats that are more straight than wavy tend to shed more, so need more frequent brushing daily or every other day to remove loose hair and prevent matting. Curlier coats shed less, but also need regular brushing to keep the coat untangled. Brush wavy and curly coats a few times a week. Like poodles, wavy-and curly-coated Bernedoodles need trimming from a professional groomer every four to eight weeks. In addition to brushing and grooming, trim your Bernedoodle's nails every two weeks and look inside you're the ears weekly, cleaning them with a pet safe ear cleaner if they look dirty. If you see excessive dirt or redness in the ears schedule a veterinary visit.<br/></p><p>Bernedoodles are smart, but how trainable they are depends on if they inherited the more agreeable nature of the poodle or the stubborn side of the Bernese Mountain Dog. Either way, positive training methods like clicker training paired with tasty treat rewards will help you get the best results from your Bernedoodle. Bernedoodles need plenty of daily exercise, including one or two walks a day plus off-leash games of fetch in a safely enclosed space like a fenced yard or dog park. Athletic Bernedoodles with biddable temperaments might also enjoy training for fun dog sports like agility, flyball, obedience, rally and dock jumping. <br/></p><h3>Common Health Problems</h3><p>Although many hybrid dog breeders claim that crossing two different purebreds results in puppies that are healthier than either parent breed, science tells us that genes don't necessarily work this way. Most purebred dogs have certain inherited health disorders in their family history. Crossing Bernese Mountain Dogs with poodles means the puppies can potentially inherit any of the genetic diseases common to either breed. </p><p>Bernese Mountain Dogs are prone to cancer, hip and elbow dysplasia, eye diseases, cardiac disease, hypothyroidism, autoimmune diseases, von Willebrand's disease (a blood clotting disorder) and gastric dilatation (bloat). Poodles are affected by certain genetic health conditions, including hip dysplasia eye disease, idiopathic epilepsy, sebaceous adenitis, von Willebrand's disease, immune-mediated disorders, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (a hip joint disorder), luxating patellas (slipped kneecaps) bloat and sebaceous adenitis (an inflammatory skin disease).<br/></p>",1012

This reserved and independent dog may have a rough or smooth coat. Rough-coated chows have a soft, wooly undercoat and a medium-length topcoat that is straight, dense, coarse, and very full. They have longer hairs (feathering) on the legs and tail, and a thick, long ""mane"" around the head and neck. Smooth chows also have a double coat, but it is much shorter. Though the breed sometimes has a reputation for being aggressive, most chows are faithful, calm dogs that make excellent companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 40 to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: Rough or smooth, double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, blue, cinnamon, cream, or red</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Aloof, independent, loyal, quiet, calm</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: China</p><h2>Characteristics of the Chow Chow</h2><p>The chow chow is a smart, independent, and sometimes aloof dog that tends to have a dominant and protective nature. The chow chow is definitely not the right breed for everyone but can be an excellent addition to the right home. This breed can work out well as a watchdog or guard dog. The chow chow tends to be a one-person dog, focusing its loyalties on the main owner. However, with proper training and socialization, the breed can get along with all family members including children, though a home with older kids will be a better fit.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Bear-like Chow Chow</h3><h2>History of the Chow Chow</h2><p>The chow chow is a native of China and among the most ancient of all dog breeds, dating back as early as 206 B.C. DNA analysis shows chows are in the branch that includes the shar-pei, Shiba Inu, and Akita, and are distinct from the lineage of all other dogs. They were used as temple guards in Asia. Though today's chow is a member of the non-sporting group, the breed was actually used for hunting over 2,000 years ago, as shown on bas-relief carvings.</p><p>This breed was called by several names in China, none of which were ""chow chow."" In the late 1700s, English merchants brought miscellaneous cargo from the Far East that they had called ""chow chow."" Because the dogs were sometimes a part of that cargo, the name eventually caught on. Queen Victoria helped popularize the breed and a breed club was formed in England in 1895.</p><p>Chows were brought to the U.S. in the late 1800s and were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1903. President Calvin Coolidge had two chows in the White House. Home guru Martha Stewart has had two chows that made television appearances on her lifestyle programs.</p><h2>Chow Chow Care</h2><p>This beautiful, devoted, and smart dog breed is beloved by many and can be an endearing companion. However, chow chows can often show aggression towards dogs of the same sex and, with their hunting background, may have a prey instinct directed towards cats and other small pets. As such, it is best that a chow chow only is brought into a multi-pet household as a puppy and raised with good attention to socialization so the dog accepts the other pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While not overly active or high-energy dogs, chows still need routine exercise to stay healthy and happy. A couple of 15- to 30-minute walks per day is a good place to start. They are not fans of vigorous romps, however. When exercising your chow, remember that it can tolerate cold weather well but it does not do well in hot weather. The dog will need a cool place, preferably indoors, when it is hot.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Regardless of what type of coat your chow chow has, routine basic grooming is essential. You will need to brush your dog two to three times per week. However, the rough coat variety will need much more maintenance to avoid tangles and matting. Chows shed a lot twice a year during a change of the seasons, and extra maintenance is necessary at these times, but generally, the rest of the time, the shed rate is low.</p><p>You will also want to trim your dog's nails every couple of weeks if they do not get worn down from activity. It is also good to pay attention to dental hygiene and brush your dog's teeth two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed needs an assertive owner who will provide discipline, socialization, and a solid foundation of obedience training. Poorly trained chows might act territorial and unfriendly, which unfortunately perpetuates the stereotype that they are aggressive by nature. Your chow needs to know that you are the boss in the household.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A chow chow should be fed twice per day with 1 to 1.5 cups of dog food at each meal. The amount will depend on your pet's size and activity level and will change through his life span. Be sure that your dog has access to fresh, clean water. By limiting the amount at each meal, you can help prevent your dog from gulping down food or eating too much, which can trigger bloating and possibly lead to stomach torsion, which is a medical emergency.</p><p>Be sure to monitor your dog's weight, which might be more than meets the eye under that voluminous coat of fur. Obesity will shorten a dog's life. Discuss a plan of action with your veterinarian if you find your dog is putting on extra pounds.</p><h2>Where to Buy or Adopt a Chow Chow</h2><p>Before you decide whether a chow chow is the right dog for you, be sure to do plenty of research. Talk to other chow chow owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more. And, if you are ready to get one, your best bet is to look to the national breed organization as a resource for reputable breeders and rescue organizations. Expect to pay a breeder between $1,000 to $4,000 for a chow chow puppy.</p><h2>Chow Chow Overview</h2><p>Low activity dog</p><p>Only sheds twice a year</p><p>Loyal dog, makes a good guard dog</p><p>Requires continuous grooming</p><p>The breed is prone to a few health issues</p><p>Can get territorial and aggressive if not trained properly</p><p><br/></p>",1060

These dogs are a mix between an Australian shepherd and an Australian cattle dog and boast characteristics from both these ""parent"" breeds.</p><p>Named for the state where they're most likely to be found, the breed earned its ""heeler"" nickname from the Australian cattle dog, because they are often referred to as the Queensland heeler or blue heeler. A great option for active owners, Texas heelers are highly intelligent and will be happiest when they have a job to do, which is why they excel in games and canine sports. They make for loyal and devoted family companions and will do well in families with children and similar-sized pets if socialized from a young age.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 17-22 inches</p><p>Weight: 25-50 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short to medium-length coat, smooth and soft fur</p><p>Coat Color: Colors include black, blue merle, or blue ticked, with the possibility for white or tan trim on feet and legs</p><p>Life Span: 12-15 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, loyal, bold, active, playful, bright, fearless</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Texas Heeler</h2><p>If you're looking for a dog that can keep pace with your active and full lifestyle, a Texas heeler may be a great choice. Bred from two highly intelligent and active ""parent"" breeds, the Texas heeler excels at being put to work or just hitting the great outdoors with their owner. If left unchecked, a Texas heeler's headstrong nature can make them difficult to train, so it's important to implement skills and command authority from the get-go with this breed. The more mentally stimulated and physically active a Texas heeler is, the more likely they are to consistently behave themselves.</p><h2>History of the Texas Heeler</h2><p>The Texas heeler is a ""designer dog"" created by breeding two purebreds. In May of 1970, Lucy Guynes registered the Texas Heeler with the Animal Research Foundation and the breed's popularity quickly grew as a working dog for farms and ranches in Texas.</p><p>The story of this breed's origins is somewhat unique when compared to many other designer breeds. To truly understand the Texas Heeler, you have to take a look at the characteristics of both the Australian cattle dog and the Australian shepherd dog. Because there isn't a great deal of information on the exact origins of the Texas heeler, an exploration of the history of its parent breeds can help understand this lovable companion and working dog.</p><p>In the 1800s, Australian settlers on large ranches bred the Australian cattle dog as a hardy working dog that could help herd cattle; they needed a breed that could tolerate the often challenging climate in Australia, and dogs that had previously been imported from England weren't able to withstand the challenging ranch life. Ranchers began breeding English dogs with the native Dingo of Australia, and most of these dogs ended up with a distinctive blue-colored coat, earning them the name blue heelers. In 1893, Robert Kaleski began breeding blue heelers, and the dog was accepted into the American Kennel Club in 1980.</p><h2>Texas Heeler Care</h2><p>Texas Heelers can be great family pets, but early (and frequent) training is necessary to ensure you channel their intelligence and energy properly. Because they are an active breed, they do best in a home that boasts plenty of land and access to activities such as hiking or dog parks. With the proper care and attention, they can be a loyal companion for years to come.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Texas heelers are bred from two very active herding breeds, so they'll require lots of daily exercise. As working dogs, they also prefer having a job to do and are highly task-oriented. They make excellent running and cycling companions but will also thrive with a variety of activities that condition them physically and stimulate them mentally, like hide-and-seek, fetch, or canine sports. They do have an innate drive to herd, so be sure to walk your dog on a leash and keep them close when out and about.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Though Texas heelers only have short- to medium-length coats, they are thick and double-layered, so they tend to shed moderately most of the time. When they blow their undercoats in the spring shedding season (and sometimes even in the fall), the shedding can become heavier. You'll want to brush out your Texas heeler's coat at least once or twice weekly with either a bristle or pin brush to help keep their coats as healthy as possible and minimize excessive shedding.</p><p>Additionally, maintain a regular grooming routine when it comes to teeth brushing, ear cleaning, and nail trims. If you feel at all unable to complete these tasks every few weeks, you can look into groomers in your area to do it for you.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Texas heelers are a highly intelligent breed, making them relatively easy to train. Though they are very affectionate with their families, they can be protective and suspicious of strangers. As a result, they are popular watchdogs (though they often won't bark unless a stranger is actually spotted). They can also be great with kids but may need to be disciplined not to nip and herd from time to time. If you have other pets in your home, its helpful to raise your dog from a young age alongside them otherwise, they may be inclined to utilize their natural herding instinct on the other fur members of the household, especially if they are smaller in size.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Though they are generally healthy, Texas heelers can develop a few health issues that you should be aware of. If you notice symptoms of the below issues or any health problems at all make sure to contact your vet promptly.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Texas heelers can be prone to easy weight gain, especially if they're not active enough, so ensure that your dog is receiving a biologically appropriate food containing both protein and healthy fats. You'll also want to look for formulas with ground bone and vegetables in them, as they contain vitamins and minerals that are essential for this breed's optimal health and performance.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Texas Heeler</h2><p>The Texas heeler technically falls under the category of a ""designer breed,"" which means you'll likely have to work with a breeder in order to take one of these dogs home. Just like any other mixed breed dog, they can sometimes end up in shelters as well as breed-specific rescues, such as the Texas Cattle Dog Rescue. Always do your best to seek out a reputable breeder before purchasing they should be able to provide you with health and vaccination records for both parents and have a track record of healthy litters. In general, you can expect to pay anywhere from $500 to $1000 for a Texas heeler puppy from a breeder.</p><h2>Texas Heeler Overview</h2><p>Great family pet</p><p>Easily trainable</p><p>Hard-working</p><p>Very intelligent</p><p>Require lots of daily exercise and mental stimulation</p><p>Can be wary of strangers</p><p>Can get destructive if left alone too long</p><p>Strong herding instincts</p>",1152

These cats are the result of a natural mutation in the 1950s in Cornwall, England. Today, they are popular in the United States.<br/></p><p>Unforgettable in appearance, these unique cats are delightful companions that prove to be easy-going in today's fast-paced households.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Sociable, interactive, playful, affectionate<br/></p><p>Weight: Up to 10 pounds</p><p>Length: 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair, curly hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Black, blue, lilac, brown, chocolate, red, and cream, smoke</p><p>Coat Patterns: Bicolor, calico, tabby, spotted, colorpoint</p><p>Eye Color: Gold, green, blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Cornish Rex Characteristics</h2><p>The Cornish Rex's svelte physique and willowy limbs seem to exemplify elegance, but it doesn't take long to realize that this cat has a playful personality and can act silly as a kitten even when fully grown (over one year of age).<br/></p><p>The Rex has an easygoing temperament and loves being part of a family; it's ready to interact and play whenever anyone else is game. Lap naps and petting are also perfectly acceptable, which is a good thing because its soft, curly coat makes snuggling a Cornish Rex practically irresistible.</p><p>Some Cornish Rex cats are vocal communicators, probably due to their Siamese heritage. These cats are especially adaptable and do well in a variety of environments which has even led to their use in therapy work.</p><h2>History of the Cornish Rex</h2><p>Hailing from England in the 1950s, this cat breed takes its name from the Cornwall region. The earliest ancestor to the Cornish Rex appeared when a genetic mutation caused a kitten to be born with an unusually curly coat and unique long-limbed body structure that quickly caught attention. The cat's mother was a British shorthair, while the identity of the father was never discovered.</p><p>The kitten's owner, Nina Ennismore, consulted with a geneticist and decided to breed the kitten who became known as Kallibunker back to his mother once he matured. The result was a litter of three kittens; two carried the recessive gene responsible for the curly coat. These early forerunners of the Cornish Rex were bred to Siamese, Burmese, and British shorthair cats to widen the genetic pool and develop the breed further.</p><p>In 1957, while the breed was still in development, a pair of Cornish Rex cats were imported to the United States. This proved to be fortunate since Kallibunker's offspring nearly disappeared from England in the late 1950s.</p><p>Additional crossbreeding in the United States with American shorthair, Havana brown, and other cats helped to preserve the breed that today has become popular for its appearance, sociable personality, and adorable antics. In 1964, the Cornish Rex received official breed recognition from the Cat Fanciers' Association.</p><h2>Cornish Rex Care</h2><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Cornish Rex cats love to explore and play. They appreciate cat trees, faux mice and feather toys, and treat puzzles. Most of all, though, they love interactive play with people (including kids) and other pets. These cats have been taught to do tricks, including waving, shaking, sitting, and more. Many even love to play fetch and have been known to use their paws to pick up items. They are particularly responsive to positive reinforcement training techniques and will gladly take a treat for a job well done!<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The curly coat is one of the most notable features of the Cornish Rex, but it requires relatively little care. Like all cats, the Cornish Rex is an avid self-groomer. However, this breed completely lacks guard hairs meaning that the coat can sometimes become oily, especially around the chin and paws. If this is the case for your Cornish Rex, you may need to bathe your cat regularly to keep them from feeling greasy to the touch. Brush your Rex's hair gently to avoid damaging the tight curls.</p><p>Without the protection of guard hairs or the insulation of a soft, downy undercoat, the Cornish Rex often feels warm to the touch but is sensitive to either hot or cold temperature extremes. For the happiest, healthiest cat, keep yours indoors with adequate heating or air conditioning.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Thanks to its diverse heritage, the Cornish Rex isn't particularly susceptible to many diseases and disorders found in other purebred cats. The breed benefits from crossbreeding between several different cats, including Siamese, Burmese, British shorthair, American shorthair, and Havana brown breeds. As a result, they often live long, healthy lives. Many Cornish Rex cats are reported to live into their late teens, with some surpassing the age of 20.</p><p>One genetic disorder that affects some Devon Rexes is called congenital hypotrichosis. It causes thinning of the fur along the torso and head and may lead to baldness in these areas. This condition isn't painful but it may necessitate skin care measures to prevent excessive dryness or sunburn, per your vet's guidance. There is no cure for hypotrichosis, and because it is a genetic disorder, affected cats should not be bred.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>At first glance, you'll likely notice the large, wide-set ears and egg-shaped face of this breed before taking in the unusually arched back, narrow waist, and long limbs that make this cat the so-called greyhound of the feline family. Adding to the almost whimsical look of the Cornish Rex is its trademark curly fur, arranged in tight rows along its svelte body.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The active Cornish Rex typically has an appetite to match. But don't let this frisky feline fool you into thinking it needs its food bowl replenished on demand. These cats are not dainty eaters, and if not monitored, they can easily become overweight. Whether or not you free-feed your cat may depend on your lifestyle and your cat's appetite. Scheduled meals make weight management much easier.</p><p>While these cats will benefit from high-quality cat food, they also appreciate the occasional treat of fruits and veggies with veterinary approval. You can offer these as treats or tasty additions to their regular mealtimes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cornish Rex</h2><p>Is the Cornish Rex the right cat for you? Learn more about this unique breed from across the pond. You will find that quality breeders, Cornish Rex rescue groups, and breed interest clubs are often happy to share insights, tips, and funny stories about these comedic creatures.</p><p>Because of their unique and coveted appearance, unwanted Rex cats rarely end up in shelters; instead, they are often re-homed through breeder networks.</p><h2>Cornish Rex Overview</h2><p>The breed is known for getting along well with children and other pets, as long as they are treated with respect. While other breeds, like the Devon Rex, are especially keen on having other animal companions, the Cornish Rex is agreeable but mostly indifferent as long as it receives enough one-on-one time with human family members.</p><p>Despite its slender frame and elegant appearance, the Cornish Rex is an athletic feline with an affectionate personality. Like all cats, this breed requires daily attention and plenty of owner interaction, and it thrives on mentally stimulating games, training, and puzzles.</p><p>If you decide to add this friendly feline to your home, you'll be rewarded with a pet that is both amusing and elegant.

They're characterized by a brown and black coat and a streamlined, athletic build that makes them both strong and agile. Though they are excellent herding dogs, German shepherds are also very well suited to work as service animals, such as guide dogs for the blind. They also perform well as working dogs, especially in police and military operations and make highly effective guard dogs. Of course, the German shepherd dog also makes a wonderful companion in the right home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>Weight: 60 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat: Coarse, medium-length double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Most colors are acceptable, such as bicolor, black and tan, black and cream, black and red, black and silver, solid black, gray, sable. Note that blue, liver or white are unfavorable based on breed standards.</p><p>Life Span: 7 to 10 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, courageous, alert, bold, loyal, protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the German Shepherd</h2><p>As a breed, German shepherds have a personality that is protective, loyal and companionable. Bred with a strong work ethic, they are among the most popular dog breeds in the United States, thanks in large part to their ability to be great family dogs. They love ""their people"" but can be cautious around strangers or new comers and thrive on the care and attention of their family.</p><h2>History of the German Shepherd</h2><p>The ancestors of German shepherd dogs acted as both servants and companions to humans for hundreds of years. Developed from old shepherd and farm dogs, the German shepherd dogs we know today were first introduced in Germany in 1899. Captain Max von Stephanitz is credited with the breed's beginnings.</p><p>During World Wars I and II, the word ""German"" was dropped and the breed was referred to as the shepherd dog or the Alsatian (a name that stuck in some regions). Worldwide interest in the breed began rising in the early 1900s and the German shepherd was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1908.</p><p>In modern times, the German shepherd remains one of the most popular dog breeds, currently ranking second in the AKC listings. Cross-breeding these dogs with Shiloh shepherds resulted in king shepherds. There is recent controversy over the breeding of show dogs to have a sloping back rather than the straight back seen with working dogs this practice has been criticized as leading to poor gait.</p><h2>German Shepherd Care</h2><p>German shepherd dogs require a decent amount of care, training, and attention but they will reward you with many years of loyalty and love as a result. They are well suited to families of all types but are best acquired as pets when they're young so they have ample time to be trained and adjust to life with their humans.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Due to the high energy level of this breed, plenty of regular exercise is essential. Your German shepherd probably needs more exercise than you think a daily walk is not enough. If you're a jogger, a German shepherd can be a good running companion. Your dog needs to run, play, and explore to prevent frustration, boredom, and pent-up energy. A dog that is bored may develop problems such as barking, digging, and chewing.</p><p>German shepherd dogs are better off in a home where there is a fenced yard for play rather than an apartment. However, it's even more important that your dog is given plenty of attention and not left alone most of the day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>German shepherds have coarse, sometimes wiry, medium-length hair with thick undercoats. Their coats should be brushed every few days to combat their relatively high shedding rate, which can be lessened by routine grooming. Still, you should be prepared to have dog hair on your clothing and furniture you'll need to vacuum frequently. Luckily, a German shepherd's coat also resists dirt and debris, so you won't need to bathe your dog more than once a month. In fact, too-frequent bathing will strip out the oils that keep its coat healthy.</p><p>Remember to keep your dog's nails trimmed to help them walk around comfortably. You should also help your dog maintain good dental hygiene by brushing its teeth a couple of times a week. These dogs like to chew and have powerful jaws, so keep durable chew toys available.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>German shepherds can be very gentle companions and family protectors with proper training and socialization. It's an ideal breed for active households and the intelligence and protective demeanor of this breed can make it a good choice for families with children (as long as the dog is properly trained).</p><p>German shepherds can sometimes become anxious or even aggressive if not properly trained and handled. These dogs will ideally be trained to perform a duty and will take pride in such. The breed's intelligence and desire to work should make training fairly easy. Proper socialization is also necessary to make sure your German shepherd does not become stressed or scared when meeting new people or animals and seeing new environments. They're typically aloof around new people and may be suspicious.</p><p>Additionally, German shepherds may have a tendency to chase cats and other small pets and may not be a good fit for a multi-pet household unless raised together. They also may not get along with strange dogs, especially of the same sex, which may be a problem when you visit a dog park.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. German shepherd dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions, however, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your German shepherd will need two meals a day of up to two cups of dry dog food, but this will depend on the dog's size, activity level, age, and other factors. They are prone to bloating and possible stomach torsion, so you'll want to avoid giving one large meal a day and having the dog gulp it down. Be sure your dog has constant access to clean, fresh water.<br/><br/>Monitor your dog's weight and address any overweight issues early, as obesity will shorten your dog's lifespan. You can also discuss nutritional needs with your veterinarian to get recommendations for feeding schedules and dog food types throughout your dog's life.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a German Shepherd</h2><p>These groups will be able to provide guidance and next steps for adoption as well as direct you to reputable breeders if you choose to go that route. The AKC also boasts a marketplace where you can inquire about AKC-registered litters that have been cared for and raised according to breed standards. While prices range, you can generally expect to pay around $1,000 for a German shepherd puppy, depending on sex, appearance, demand, and more.</p><h2>German Shepherd Overview</h2><p>German shepherds are perennially popular dogs and will continue to be looked upon as desirable and loving companions for decades to come.

These compact and sturdy dogs date back to the 1800s. This breed's human-like expressions are reflective of its personality, which is known for including mischievous and playful antics.</p><p>The breed is also known as the griffon bruxellois, and it may simply be called ""griff."" Lively and alert, the Brussels griffon is a pleasure to know. These dogs have a reputation for being natural entertainers and are joyful and loyal companions to their owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 7 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Coat: Smooth or rough</p><p>Coat Color: Red, black and tan, solid black, or belge (mix of black and reddish-brown)</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, playful, loyal, sensitive, intelligent, stubborn</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes (rough-coated); No (smooth-coated)</p><p>Origin: Belgium</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Scene Stealing Brussels Griffon</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Brussels Griffon</h2><p>The Brussels griffon's personality is unique, being both curious and sensitive to its surroundings. While they have an especially friendly temperament with their owners, these dogs are also independent thinkers that tend to follow their own desires when it comes to training. Griffs are not recommended for households with young children, however, they love to play with their adult families.<br/></p><p>Expect your dog to be glued to its favorite human. This is not a breed that likes to be left alone for most of the day, as it can become sad, bored, and destructive when ignored. For an attentive owner, the Brussels griffon is a spirited and loyal friend.</p><h2>History of the Brussels Griffon</h2><p>The Brussels griffon, as indicated by its name, originated in Brussels, Belgium. Its ancestors were used by coachmen during the 19th century to hunt rats in stables. These Belgian dogs were similar to Affenpinschers, but their exact development is not known. It is believed that these dogs were crossed with pugs and English toy spaniels, eventually resulting in two types: the rough, wiry-coated variety and the smooth-coated variety known as the Brabancon.</p><p>Brussels griffons became popular when Queen Marie Henriette of Belgium began breeding and showing them. This led to their exportation to England and the United States. The Brussels griffon was first recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1910. However, they almost disappeared in Europe during World Wars I and II, and they still remain fairly rare. Though they are no longer needed as workers, they have become known as wonderful companions.</p><p>A Brussels griffon was featured in the movie in the 1990s. These dogs have also become popular social media stars thanks to their resemblance to Ewok characters in the movies.</p><h2>Brussels Griffon Care</h2><p>Brussels griffons are known for being a relatively low-maintenance breed when it comes to their exercise and grooming needs. However, the big personalities of these small dogs can prove difficult during training, as their intelligence can combine with stubborn habits that require extra care.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Brussels griffons should receive routine exercise, but this breed does not require substantial activity to stay healthy. About 30 minutes per day of walking along with a few play sessions should suffice. Be aware that griffs are amazing climbers and jumpers, so it's important to protect your dog from taking a fall that could cause injury.</p><p>The flat faces of these dogs don't allow them to cool the air when breathing, which makes them more susceptible to overheating and heat exhaustion. Only exercise your Brussels griffon during the coolest part of the day on hot days, and never leave your dog unattended in a vehicle (even on cooler days). This breed also does not tolerate cold weather well and may need a sweater during chilly seasons.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The smooth-coated Brussels griffon requires little more than routine grooming with brushing twice per week, but you should expect some shedding. The rough-coated griff sheds much less, and this is the hypoallergenic option for owners with mild to moderate allergies.</p><p>The rough-coated variety needs to have its coat hand-stripped every three to four months. Schnauzer cuts can avoid the need for stripping. Many groomers no longer perform stripping, which is a lengthy process that can be uncomfortable for the dog.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Brussels griffon is a smart little dog, and therefore quite receptive to training. Like many small breeds, these dogs may possess a feisty streak and can be stubborn. Consistent obedience training is necessary.</p><p>Since they are especially prone to alert barking, many owners use special commands to stop barking after giving an alert. Brussels griffons are attentive watchdogs that may become problem barkers.</p><p>Housebreaking is another common training challenge. Crate training is recommended to prevent them from sneaking off in the house to hide accidents. You will need to be diligent, but know that some griffons are never completely housebroken.</p><p>Griffs can be suspicious of new people and can be fear-biters that snap when frightened. Early socialization with other dogs and new people can discourage fear. They are prone to being territorial and are not afraid of challenging larger dogs, which is can be a dangerous combination. However, griffons often do well with cats.</p><p>Similar to their fear-based aggression with other dogs, Brussels griffons are prone to snap and growl at young children if they are hit, chased, or picked up when they don't want to be. If it's raised from puppyhood, you may be able to coach your kids to let this dog determine how they will interact together. Children will need to recognize when the dog is uncomfortable and allow the dog to retreat.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems (such as those that affect flat-faced dogs like Brussels griffons) can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Brussels griffons should typically be fed two meals per day of high-quality dog food. The best diet for your specific dog will depend on their age, weight, and activity level, so it's best to ask your veterinarian to help you come up with a suitable meal plan.</p><p>It's important to monitor your dog's weight, as even one extra pound is excessive for a toy breed. Obesity can shorten their lifespan and increase the risk of other health conditions.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Brussels Griffon</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and rescue groups for Brussels griffons in need of homes. If this specific breed isn't available for adoption in your region, many similar dogs can be found to join your family.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a Brussels griffon from a breeder, be sure to ask for the medical history of the litter's parents. Responsible breeders should readily provide results of any recommended genetic tests and allow potential adopters to see the conditions their dogs are kept in. The price of puppies can vary anywhere from $1,000 to $4,000, but they may be higher or lower depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Brussels Griffon Overview</h2><p>Smart and alert</p><p>Extremely loyal</p><p>Confident and curious</p><p>Not recommended for small children</p><p>Housebreaking can be challenging</p><p>Prone to aggression with larger dogs</p>",1172

The dogs originate in the Netherlands, but the breed is often confused with German shepherds. While they do share very similar ancestry, this less common breed is regarded as easier to train and can make great family pets in an active home.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 22.5 to 24.5 inches (males); 21.5 to 23.5 inches (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 75 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, long, and rough-coated varieties</p><p>COAT COLOR: Brindled</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Reliable, affectionate, loyal, alert, obedient, trainable</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Netherlands</p><h2>Characteristics of the Dutch Shepherd</h2><p>Dutch shepherds have great intelligence, temperaments, and working skills, but they can be quite independent. However, they are affectionate, steadfast and loyal dogs that form strong attachments with their family. With the right introductions, they live well with other dogs and children, too.</p><h2>History of the Dutch Shepherd</h2><p>As with most shepherd dogs, the Dutch shepherd was originally developed for their herding skills. They are also sometimes known as Dutch herders. They were in demand because of the high volumes of arable and livestock farming in the Netherlands in the 19th century. Their all-round capabilities meant they were also often put to use as farm guard dogs. Their strength meant they could even pull carts.</p><p>The first breed standard was recognized in 1898, and, then, in 1914, it was updated so that only the brindle coloring was accepted. This helped to distinguish them clearly from their German and Belgian shepherd relatives.</p><p>By the early 20th century, farming was becoming more industrialized and land reclamation was common. These modern farming techniques meant that the skills of the Dutch shepherd were no longer in demand. During World War II breeding pretty much came to a halt, and many dogs perished as a result of the fighting. These wonderful dogs almost became extinct. Although enthusiasts reestablished breeding programs after the war, the Dutch shepherd is still considered a rare breed to this day. When they aren't adopted as pets, they are often used by the police and military for search and rescue, and also as assistance dogs.</p><h2>Dutch Shepherd Care</h2><p>A Dutch shepherd will usually thrive in a home that is active, stimulating, and responsibly grooms the dog. They are not suited to being left alone for long periods. Problem behaviors are likely to surface if they do not get enough enrichment. They can be strong-willed and independent. This, combined with their fierce intelligence, means they will develop their own way of doing things if they do not receive clear training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed needs decent daily walks and exercise that range between 30 to 60 minutes. Ideally, a Dutch shepherd will live with a family that offers it a chance to ""work"" since they excel in competitive dog sports like agility, nose work, and obedience. These shepherds love to run, so an exercise like Frisbee will be much appreciated. When they receive appropriate amounts of mental and physical enrichment, they are usually then reserved and calm around the home, and not regarded as high maintenance.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Dutch shepherd's brindle coat comes in three varieties; a short, smooth type, long-haired, and wire/rough-coated. The wire-haired variety is scarce. For the smooth and long-haired types, weekly grooming will be required to remove loose hair and keep their coat and skin in good condition. Their coats are water-resistant so frequent bathing is usually not necessary. During their annual moults, you may need to use a good de-shedding tool like a Furminator and have the vacuum cleaner on hand.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Early, appropriate, and ongoing positive training and socialization will be required. When you do work on their training, you will likely be amazed at how quickly they pick up your cues and enjoy learning.</p><p>Their natural guarding instincts can mean that they will be protective and territorial, and training will be required to ensure this is channeled appropriately. You should also be mindful of their herding instincts too. Be ready to ask for alternative behaviors if they start to focus too much on herding and chasing.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Unlike their exceptionally popular relative, the German shepherd, the Dutch shepherd has very few inheritable conditions and is regarded as a very healthy breed in general.</p><p>The few conditions that can be a problem occur in relatively low numbers. A good breeder will have performed relevant health checks on prospective parents.</p><p>Hip Dysplasia: This is a common problem in many large breed dogs, particularly shepherds, and the Dutch shepherd is no exception. A good breeder will perform health checks, though.</p><p>Goniodysplasia: This relates to a restricted flow of fluid from the eye. In severe cases, it can lead to blindness. While rare, this condition has been shown to affect the rough-haired variety of the breed. Again, good breeders will screen parents for this condition.</p><p>Inflammatory Myopathy: Recent studies have identified another inheritable disease, specific to Dutch shepherds, that has been named inflammatory myopathy. It is progressive and involves the rapid degeneration of muscles. There is no cure, but it is possible to health screen parents to avoid puppies developing the condition.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, it is important to feed your Dutch shepherd a high-quality and appropriately portion-controlled diet. If they are leading a particularly active lifestyle, then you may need to consider feeding a food higher in protein or specially formulated for active dogs.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Dutch Shepherd</h2><p>While the Dutch shepherd is a rare breed, there are several passionate, dedicated, and responsible breeders out there.</p><p>Always do your research and make sure that they have done the appropriate health screen tests on the parents. You should see mum and her pups together in a nurturing home environment. Also, the pups should not go to their new home until they are at least eight weeks old.</p><p>A good place to start your research would be the Dutch Shepherd Dog Club of America.</p><p>If you want to open your home up to a dog looking for a loving forever home, then why not consider adoption? Get in touch with North American Dutch Shepherd Rescue to find out if any dogs are looking for homes in your area.</p><p>If you're able to adopt a Dutch shepherd, you might pay around $300. But most likely, you will need to find a breeder for this dog. This dog is pricey to buy from a breeder, so expect to pay between $1,000 to $3,500 or more.</p><h2>Dutch Shepherd Overview</h2><p>Family-friendly companions</p><p>Intelligent, highly trainable and eager to please</p><p>A healthy breed with few inheritable conditions</p><p>Need a lot of exercise and enrichment to prevent destructive problem behaviors</p><p>Their herding and guarding instincts can be an issue without proper guidance</p><p>Their moulting can be excessive</p>",1112

The löwchen's unique name actually means ""little lion"" in German, which is why this breed is often affectionately referred to as the little lion dog. These petite pups boast a huge heart, with a courageous, fun-loving, and affectionate disposition that makes them the ideal companion for any family.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 18 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long, thick, soft, slightly wavy coat that is often cut into a distinctive Lion Clip</p><p>Coat Color: Come in a wide variety of colors and patterns.</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, playful, attentive, active, protectively, lively</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: France, Germany, Europe</p><h2>Characteristics of the Löwchen</h2><p>The löwchen is a adaptable little dog that can make a fantastic pet for most families. The breed is known for being very affectionate and they enjoy being showered with love at all times. However, they are best suited to living in a home where they will have company most of the day to prevent separation anxiety from surfacing. They are known for getting along well with respectful children and other animals and can be very playful and fun-loving.</p><h2>History of the Löwchen</h2><p>Despite their name being of German origin, the exact history of the löwchen is still something that is debated amongst breed enthusiasts and historians. Some argue that the breed is related to the Poodle and thus originated from Northern Europe, around the French, Belgian, and German parts of the continent. Others believe they are more closely related to the Bichon Frise and were first developed in the Mediterranean region. There are even suggestions that they may have come from Russia or Tibet.</p><p>Dogs resembling the breed, with the distinctive lion clip haircut, have been depicted in paintings as far back as the 16th century. There is no debating that the löwchen, wherever they first came from, is a breed with a long history. Given their representation in a variety of artwork, it is clear that they were a popular choice amongst selected gentry and regal figures. It has even been argued that their famous haircut came about because their warm skin acted as a hot water bottle when ladies kept them in their beds.</p><p>The first formal löwchen breeder is recorded as an individual named Dr. Walthier in early 19th century Germany. At the end of the 19th century, breed enthusiast Madame Benert was credited with ensuring the survival of this rare breed. They were introduced in the United States in the 1970s and received recognition by the AKC in 1999. Löwchens are still considered to be one of the rarest breeds today, although numbers are steadily increasing.</p><h2>Löwchen Care</h2><p>Löwchens are fairly easy to care for thanks to their petite size, but they will need more exercise and grooming than you might assume. Their coat is high-maintenance, and they will need frequent brushing and trims to stay looking their best. Your löwchen will also need to stay active, though thankfully it will be easy for them to get their exercise indoors or outdoors.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite its small size and love of pampering, löwchens are not simply lapdogs. They are an active, curious, and energetic breed, and they will need a decent amount of daily exercise and plenty of enrichment around the home to keep them stimulated. They are known for enjoying and excelling in agility and will enjoy mental stimulation from dog puzzles. Likewise, they can definitely get their exercise indoors (as well as outdoors), provided they live in a big enough home for brief games of catch or physical activity.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The löwchen has a long, single coat and, while they do not shed much, they will need regular grooming to prevent mats and tangles from developing. Their coat grows quickly too and they'll need regular clipping to stop it from becoming unruly. They are usually given a simple puppy trim, but can also receive the traditional show-style Lion Clip that distinguishes the breed. This style of clip varies depending on the country you are in, but it generally involves the hair around their rear end being shaved off completely.</p><p>Additionally, you should trim your löwchen's nails about once a month and check their ears weekly for wax buildup, redness, and abnormalities, which can be a sign of serious infections. Also, aim to brush your dog's teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Löwchens are a clever little breed and respond extremely well to positive reinforcement training methods. They learn commands and tricks very quickly and are eager to please their owners. They even have a history as circus performers in centuries past. The löwchen is known for being a fearless little dog and can sometimes take on the role of watchdog, alerting with frequent barking. To prevent their barking from becoming excessive, you may need to put in extra training around this aspect of their personality.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Löwchens are generally considered a robust and healthy breed. However, as with most breeds, they are known for being associated with a few inheritable health conditions. A good breeder will perform health checks on prospective parents to minimize the risk of these conditions developing in puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with all dogs, löwchens should be fed a high-quality, balanced, and appropriately portion-controlled diet. It can be easy to spoil your dog with too many unhealthy treats and table scraps or just by simple overfeeding. Obesity is one of the biggest health problems in dogs across the United States, and it can lead to a host of other (more serious) problems.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Löwchen</h2><p>Because the löwchen is a rare breed, it may mean you'll have to go on a waiting list or travel further to secure a puppy. If you decide this is the right breed for you, it can be easy to get carried away in your excitement and rush into something. Make sure that you do your research and are prepared to be patient to wait for a pup from a reputable breeder.</p><p>Unscrupulous backyard breeders and puppy mills often target rare breed enthusiasts. By buying a puppy from a source of this type, you are inadvertently helping an industry rife with cruel practices thrive. Your puppy may not have been appropriately socialized, could have health problems, and may have been taken from their mother too early.</p><p>A good place to start your research would be to contact The Löwchen Club of America. Given their rarity, there will not be too many löwchens in rescue organizations. Don't let that put you off considering adoption, though. The Löwchen Club of America has a rescue program, and there are lots of other deserving small breed dogs in shelters across the country looking for their forever homes.</p><h2>Löwchen Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and fun-loving</p><p>Confident and adaptable</p><p>Doesn't shed much</p><p>Can be vocal</p><p>Not suited to a house where they will be left too long on their own</p><p>Regular grooming required to prevent matting</p>",1160

It is known for its wrinkled skin, blue-black tongues, and bristle-like coat, all of which makes it stand out from the crowd. The breed isn't best for novice owners, though. This very intelligent dog is independent, aloof, and guarded with strangers. The breed can also be prone to several health conditions. But the shar-pei can also be a fiercely loyal and protective family companion who loves to snuggle.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 18 to 20 inches (to the withers)</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 60 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short and bristly</p><p>COAT COLOR: Various solid color shades include black, chocolate, blue, and cream; mixed coat colors are not accepted as a breed standard</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Devoted, loving, affectionate, reserved, independent</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: China</p><h2>Characteristics of the Shar-Pei</h2><p>The breed can vary greatly in appearance. Although the American Kennel Club does not recognize two distinct varieties, they are distinguished by some other International Kennel Clubs. The older, traditional shape from China is referred to as the ""bone-mouth"" variety. They are taller, slimmer and have much fewer wrinkles. The Westernized variety is referred to as the ""meat-mouth"" and is much stockier, has more wrinkles, and a wider, fleshier head.</p><h2>History of the Shar-Pei</h2><p>The shar-pei has a very ancient history. It is not known quite how far back this goes, but some statues have a strong resemblance to the breed that date back to the time of the Hang Dynasty in China, over 2,000 years ago.</p><p>They are thought to originally have been bred for their hunting and fighting prowess, and the wrinkles in their skin and roughness of their coat would have helped to prevent their opponents from getting a grip. The name shar-pei is derived from the Cantonese translation of the words ""sand skin.""</p><p>During the communist revolution in China in the mid 20th century, their numbers dwindled so drastically that they almost became extinct. In the 1970s, a Chinese breeder sent an impassioned plea to American dog enthusiasts asking for help to save the breed. As a result of this, a select few dogs were sent over to the States and the breed had a resurgence in popularity.</p><p>They were then featured on the cover of magazine and were involved in many high profile ad campaigns. The demand for shar-peis during the 1970s and 1980s was so great from all of this attention that the breed suffered as a result of unscrupulous overbreeding.</p><p>The breed was officially recognized by the (AKC) in the late 1980s. Since then, while still cherished by enthusiasts, their popularity has waned somewhat and this has been of benefit to the breed in terms of responsible breeding programs being more common, but the fallout from that time is still apparent.</p><h2>Shar-Pei Care</h2><p>Caring for a shar-pei is somewhat simple. It does not have the exercise requirements of many other breeds of its size, and it is not known for being vocal. The dog is a naturally clean one and it often has an aversion to water, so you are unlikely to find your pup enjoying a romp in muddy puddles. The breed is known for its stubborn and willful nature, and patience and commitment will be required to guarantee success when it comes to training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The shar-pei is not known for being a high-energy breed. It would be rare to see them taking part in agility. Providing they get good daily walks totaling about an hour a day and are kept appropriately enriched in the house, they are often regarded as dogs suited to apartment living.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The shar-pei grooming regime is relatively straight forward. Their coats do not require much maintenance, usually just a weekly brush out to remove dead hair. They do shed, but it is not excessive.</p><p>If they do need a bath, the biggest concern is ensuring that, if they are particularly wrinkly, you properly dry in between the folds. They can be prone to skin infections. They may also need their mouth cleaned after eating.</p><p>Their very small ears can also be prone to developing infections. Making sure that they are cleaned with a high-quality cleanser is often recommended.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>A shar-pei must receive appropriate socialization and training from the beginning. They are often wary of other dogs and strangers and can have a high prey drive. For these reasons, they can do better as the only pet in the household.</p><p>They are not keen on roughhousing and it is important that training is done using positive reinforcement methods. Trying to force a shar-pei to comply will usually not end well.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The shar-pei can be prone to many different health conditions. Many of these are likely attributable to the irresponsible overbreeding that occurred when their popularity exploded in the 1980s.</p><p>They are also classed as a brachycephalic, or flat-faced, breed and this can mean that they are less tolerant of heat and great care should be taken when they are exposed to hotter weather and when exercising.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, it is important to feed them a high-quality, carefully portion-controlled diet and that they always have access to a fresh water source.</p><p>Because the shar-pei is more prone to bacterial skin conditions, if you are feeding a wet or raw diet, extra care should be taken to ensure that any residue is cleaned away from the mouth area after eating.</p><p>Because they are also known for being prone to gastric torsion, it may be worth feeding them from a slow feeding bowl if they tend to guzzle their food quickly.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Shar-Pei Dog</h2><p>A shar-pei is not the easiest of dogs in terms of potential health problems and trainability, so it is important to consider your lifestyle, experience, and motivations before offering one a home.</p><p>If you are buying a puppy, it is always important to do your research to ensure you find a reputable and responsible breeder. This is all the more important with a shar-pei given their potential health and temperament issues. Expect to pay a breeder between $1,000 up to $2,500 for a champion blood line puppy.</p><p>Make sure that you select a registered breeder, that keeps both mother and pups in a nurturing home environment, that has made appropriate health checks, and that has not separated pups from their mother before they reach eight weeks old.</p><p>Because this breed is not generally suited to new dog owners, it does, unfortunately, mean that shar-peis can frequently end up in rescue. There are some breed specific rescues out there, but don't forget to also enquire with your local shelter. Offering a forever home to a rescue dog can be a hugely rewarding experience.</p><h2>Shar-Pei Overview</h2><p>Low energy breed suited to apartment living</p><p>Loyal to its family, but not needy</p><p>Distinctive look that requires minimal grooming</p><p>Prone to a number of health conditions</p><p>Requires patience when training</p><p>Not very sociable breed, reactive towards strange dogs</p>",1144

This affectionate breed is always up for an adventure as long as it's by its owner's side.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 18 inches (males); 17 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>Coat: Dense, water-repellent, long, and either wavy or straight<br/></p><p>Coat Color: Black, liver, golden, golden liver, or roan</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Companionable, active, alert, friendly, lively</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Field Spaniel</h2><p>Field spaniels are very loving dogs, and they develop strong bonds with their people. In general, they're friendly with dogs, other pets, and strangers, but it's still smart for owners to properly socialize any dog breed early on.</p><p>Field spaniels were bred to hunt, and they have plenty of energy that pairs best with owners who exercise often. Because they need plenty of space to run around, these spaniels aren't recommended for people living in apartments, condos, or homes without backyards; without enough activity, they can become bored, which often leads to mischievous or destructive behavior. However, for the right people, this breed is a devoted companion that's easy to train.<br/></p><h2>History of the Field Spaniel</h2><p>Unlike the breeders of many hunting dogs, the original Field spaniel breeders in 19th century England actually preferred all black dogs. Most hunters prefer dogs with white markings so they can easily be seen in the field. However, the Field spaniel was also bred to be a show dog while maintaining its excellent hunting skills. All-black litters were ideal for canine competitions.</p><p>For many years, different types of spaniels were categorized by their weight. If a single puppy from a litter weighed over 25 pounds, it was considered a Field spaniel; if the puppy weighed under 25 pounds, it was considered a Cocker spaniel. It wasn't until 1901 that breeders developed clear distinctions between the two types of dogs.</p><p>The American Kennel Club registered its very first Field spaniel in 1894. A few years later, a devastating fire wiped out a Field spaniel breeding kennel, which essentially wiped out the population in the United States. Another Field spaniel wasn't registered with the AKC until 1930.</p><p>In 1967, three Field spaniels were imported to the United States. Along with a few subsequent imports, this raised the Field spaniel population in the United States slightly, but it's still a very rare dog breed in North America.</p><h2>Field Spaniel Care</h2><p>Thanks to their long history as sporting dogs, Field spaniels need lots of physical activity to expel their energy. Owners should prepare for daily exercise along with standard grooming. When it comes to training, these intelligent dogs are eager to please and learn quickly.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Field spaniels are active, high-energy dogs that need two to three hours of exercise every day. Frequent walks, runs, and swims are great ways for owners to keep these dogs active, but games that challenge their minds can also keep them mentally stimulated.</p><p>Consider teaching your dog to fetch, using puzzle toys, and playing games like hide-and-seek (either to find treats or family members around the house). Remember to always keep your Field spaniel in an enclosed, fenced-in area when playing outdoors today's spaniels retain their drive to hunt, and they may take off to chase small animals.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Despite the Field spaniel's long, dense coat, its grooming needs are relatively low-maintenance compared to other spaniels. This breed should be brushed often and bathed as needed. If your dog develops knots, tangles, or mats, gently remove them with your fingers and brush them out with a pin brush. For especially tough tangles, try spritzing your dog's coat with a gentle leave-in conditioner spray.</p><p>Like all breeds, the Field spaniel's teeth should be brushed regularly. Daily brushing is ideal, but a few times per week can still help protect their teeth and gums from oral disease and plaque buildup. Dental chews are fine in moderation, but shouldn't be the only method of dental care.</p><p>Check your dog's ears weekly for build-up and debris. Dogs with floppy ears are especially prone to ear infections. Clean your dog's ears as needed with a pet-safe ear cleaner and a cotton ball. Avoid using cotton swabs, which can damage the delicate inner-ear structure.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Field spaniel is typically easy to train, and basic obedience lessons can begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. Like most breeds, these dogs respond best to positive reinforcement training methods. Reward your dog with treats, affection, and playtime when it performs desirable behaviors. Avoid methods that involve punishment, as they can be harmful to a dog's sensitive personality and lead it to resist training or become afraid of its owners.</p><p>Since Field spaniels are so athletic, they also excel in canine sports like agility training and obedience competitions. Advanced training for these activities will keep your dog's mind stimulated and can continue throughout its life.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Field spaniels are generally healthy dogs, but like most purebreds, they're still susceptible to a few inherited health problems. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards by testing prospective parent dogs before breeding. When adopting a puppy, ask your breeder to provide the litter's medical background.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Field spaniel one and a half to two cups of high-quality dog food divided into two meals each day. Since these dogs are so active, they can usually have a few extra treats just be sure to monitor your dog's weight and avoid overfeeding, which can lead to canine obesity and other serious health problems.</p><p>Dogs need different nutrients at different stages of life to maintain their health. Talk to your veterinarian to determine the best meal plan for your Field spaniel based on its age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Field Spaniel</h2><p>Because Field spaniels are rare in the United States, they're not likely to be found at local shelters. However, shelters in your area can introduce you to similar spaniels in need of forever homes. They may also recommend breed-specific rescues in different regions to help you locate a Field spaniel elsewhere.</p><p>When adopting puppies from breeders, it's essential to do your research. Your breeder should readily provide you with the medical background of the litter's parents. Prospective adopters should also be allowed to meet the parent dogs and see that they're kept in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Look for signs of backyard breeding like unhealthy dogs, several litters at a time, or unsanitary conditions. Field spaniel puppies typically cost between $2,000 and $5,000 from breeders, but prices can vary depending on their pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Field Spaniel Overview</h2><p>Intelligent and trainable</p><p>Loving and loyal to family</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>Very high energy; needs vigorous exercise daily</p><p>Not recommended for apartments, condos, or small spaces</p><p>Can become destructive if left alone</p>",1187

This is a fine breed for a family, as it requires a lot of attention, play time, and affection, which many children are more than happy to supply. But although it can seem that the breed has endless energy, once playtime is over it is happy to cuddle up with a favorite human for some quality time and petting.</p><p>If you bring a Brazilian Shorthair into your home, be prepared with plenty of toys to keep it occupied, as well as one or more cat trees to provide opportunities for climbing, exploring, and exercising. These are active cats that like to keep busy.</p><h2>History of the Brazilian Shorthair</h2><p>The Brazilian Shorthair originated from the common street cats of Brazil. It is thought that these felines first entered Brazil around the year 1500 CE aboard the ships of Portuguese sailors. The breed's development is credited to Paulo Samuel Ruschi, an engineer who became interested in the appearance and genetics of the street cats in Brazil. With help and input from other cat breeders, he began breeding Brazilian street cats in the hope of creating a set breed.</p><p>In 1998, the World Cat Federation approved the Brazilian Shorthair as a recognized purebred cat breed. However, the breed has not yet received recognition from TICA or CFA. </p><h2>Brazilian Shorthair Care</h2><p>The Brazilian Shorthair is a friendly cat breed with an outgoing personality. The social street-cat mentality remains in these purebred felines, making meeting new people and exploring new places right up their alley. These cats thrive with plenty of attention, play, and snuggle time. Their social, playful, energetic nature also makes them perfect feline companions for children.</p><p>These cats love to run around and explore, so be sure to give them enough space for adventuring and expending energy. Playtime is a perfect way to both exercise and spend time with your Brazilian Shorthair. Cat trees, playgrounds, and scratching posts are well-loved by this breed and will ensure that your cat is happy, enriched, and entertained. However, when it is time to wind down, your Brazilian Shorthair will be just as happy snuggling on the couch with you. </p><p>As suggested by its name, the Brazilian Shorthair has a very short coat that does not shed much or produce much dander, although the breed is not truly hypoallergenic. This makes grooming very simple. Brushing once a week should be plenty to keep your Brazilian shorthair's coat clean and in good condition. Remember to regularly brush its teeth and check its nails and ears as well. </p><p>Brazilian Shorthairs have retained the street-smarts from their ancestors, making them sharp, intelligent felines. They learn new things quickly and love to be challenged. This makes them an excellent breed to teach tricks.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Brazilian Shorthair is a relatively robust and active breed with no common, breed-specific health problems known. However, cat owners should be on the lookout for common issues that may arise in any breed, such as obesity and ear infections. And of course, any cat might develop a health problem or disease during its lifetime, so be sure to take your Brazilian Shorthair for regular checkups with the veterinarian. This makes it likelier that you'll detect potential health problems before they become serious.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Brazilian Shorthair is a large cat; males can weigh more than 20 pounds. These cats are longer than they are tall, and while they are muscular, they aren't too stocky in build. They have large, pointed ears set well apart and equally large eyes. Their fur is short and sleek, with very little undercoat. This means that they don't shed much.</p><p>When it comes to color, just about anything goes. Your Brazilian Shorthair can be any color that naturally occurs in felines, including black, white, gray, brown, red, or cream. And any coat pattern is acceptable, including solid, tabby, calico, tortoiseshell, tuxedo, or bi-color. The one coat pattern that isn't allowed in a purebred Brazilian Shorthair is ""points,"" which are the darker face, legs, and tail typical of the Siamese cat.</p><p>Brazilian Shorthairs can have any eye color, including blue, brown, amber, orange, green, or yellow.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feeding your Brazilian Shorthair high-quality cat food will help ensure that it lives a long and healthy life. Every cat will have its own likes, dislikes, and dietary needs, but in general, cats require a diet that is high in protein, moderate in fats, and low in carbohydrates. Most adult cats do well with two meals per day, while kittens need three to four smaller meals. Your cat should always have access to clean water.</p><p>You can feed your cat all kibble, all canned food, or a mixture of both. They key is not to overfeed your feline, as obesity is a common concern among indoor cats. Consult your veterinarian for more information on your cat's unique dietary needs.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Brazilian Shorthair</h2><p>Because the Brazilian Shorthair is an uncommon breed outside of its native country, it may be a bit tricky to find a rescue or breeder in the United States.

These quick and fearless dogs are well-known for their athleticism when it comes to herding, but it's their smart and friendly personalities that have made them such a well-loved breed.</p><p>Briards are unmistakably loving toward their humans. They do best in homes with active families that plan to spend plenty of time with their dog, and the Briard's warm spirit and good nature are a perfect match for affectionate owners. Their unique looks and herding prowess have given these dogs a special place in breed enthusiasts' hearts for centuries.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 23 to 27 inches (males); 22 to 25.5 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 100 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double coat with wiry, wavy outercoat and soft undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Solid black, gray, tawny, white, or combinations of two colors</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, affectionate, intelligent, companionable, active</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Briard</h2><p>Briards are known for their companionable temperament that is especially suited for homes with children. They can also be independent; your dog will be happiest in the company of its family, but many Briards are also content with a few hours alone. Most importantly, your dog will benefit from plenty of playful activities each day when you're together.</p><p>Since they were bred to be herding dogs, Briards also retain many of these working characteristics. Your dog will require considerable daily exercise to stay healthy and well-mannered at home. This breed's herding instincts also contributed to its prey drive, so it's important to introduce your Briard to other animals to encourage a social personality throughout its life. Thankfully, this intelligent breed is typically easy to train.</p><h2>History of the Briard</h2><p>Briards have a long and storied past, appearing in popular culture as early as the 14th century. These dogs were originally bred to herd and guard sheep in the dairy belt of Northern France. The Briard's name in its home region is Chien Berger de Brie, or ""Shepherd Dog Brie,"" referencing the popular Brie cheese from the French dairy belt. The breed was also a favorite of Napoleon, a French revolutionary, who wasn't known to care much for dogs in the first place.</p><p>The French appreciated and revered the Briard's intelligence and athleticism. The breed was considered a ""two for one"" dog of sorts: Briards were as capable of herding sheep as protecting them from predators (and even protecting local vegetation from the sheep). For a long time, the Briard was a mainstay on French farms, and for good reason. In addition to their herding skills, these dogs are extremely sweet-natured and affectionate.</p><p>Briards also proved incredibly useful during the French and Indian War when they were used to carry supplies, guard access points, and search for wounded soldiers. For their heroic efforts, Briards were named the official dog breed of the French army.</p><p>The Briard's introduction to the United States can be traced back to Thomas Jefferson, a Founding Father and the third U.S. president. Following a period as the U.S. Ambassador to France, Jefferson purchased a pregnant Briar named Bergère in the late 1780s. He brought her home to Monticello, his Virginia estate, where the first generation of Briards officially made their mark on American soil. Over time, Jefferson had more of the breed sent over to him courtesy of his friend (and Revolutionary War hero) Marquis de Lafayette a Briard lover himself.</p><p>Today, Briards are well established in American life. As family companions and workers alike, they haven't left their herding heritage behind, as evidenced by their high trainability and protective natures. </p><h2>Briard Care</h2><p>While the Briard can be a beloved companion to its owners, this breed requires specific care to thrive. Potential owners should prepare for daily exercise and extensive grooming. When it comes to training, the Briard is an intelligent dog that typically learns new skills and behaviors quickly.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>It should come as no surprise that Briards love having a job to do. This herding breed comes with a responsibility to channel its energy both physically and mentally. In most family homes, high-intensity activities like biking, hiking, and running can provide the exercise these dogs need. For mental stimulation, owners can play brain games with their Briard. Nose work, hide-and-seek, and playing fetch are fun ways to provide entertainment for this smart breed. Briards are happy to curl up on the couch by their humans, but walks and other activities are necessary for about 30 to 45 minutes per day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The long fur of a Briard is prone to tangles and matting, and as such, it's crucial that Briard caregivers maintain a strict grooming schedule. This includes multiple brushings a week in addition to general care like teeth brushing, ear cleaning, and nail trimming. On the bright side, Briards are light shedders, and while they're not hypoallergenic, they do leave considerably less fur around than other large, long-haired breeds.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>As for training, the Briard is always open to learning new tricks and skills. Since Briards are more than capable of thinking for themselves, their intelligence can occasionally work against them in training. These dogs might not always put their owner's requests first when training begins, but once they get the hang of a new skill, they're sure to excel at it. This is true for everything from competitive dog sports to service roles. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Briards are known to be quite healthy dogs, but like most purebreds, they may experience some inherited health problems. Potential owners should research responsible breeders before adopting a puppy. Breeders can provide health clearances for their puppies, including those from the Canine Eye Registry Foundation and the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Briard high-quality dog food at least twice per day. Since this large breed is prone to Bloat, it's best to plan several smaller meals per day rather than one large portion. Foods high in protein and optimized for your specific dog's age, weight, activity level, and health conditions are best to ensure their nutritional needs are met.</p><p>Because Briards need a lot of exercise, feel free to supplement with treats in addition to meals, though always keep a close eye on your dog's weight and adjust daily caloric intake as needed. Your veterinarian can provide a healthy meal plan for your dog in different stages of life.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Briard</h2><p>Briards aren't the rarest dog breed, but it's not very likely to find these dogs in rescues. Visit your local shelter to meet similar dogs in your area, or contact breed-specific rescues to adopt a Briard in need of a forever home.</p><p>If you plan to adopt a Briard puppy, it's essential to find a responsible breeder. Ensure you're provided with the litter's health screenings and able to meet their parents. These puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $1,500, but prices can be as high as $3,000 depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Briard Overview</h2><p>Incredibly sweet, eager to please their humans</p><p>Independent and not overly needy, but loves time with family</p><p>Great with children</p><p>Requires a lot of grooming</p><p>Needs mental stimulation to prevent destructive behavior when bored</p><p>High exercise needs</p>",1189

Also called Northern breeds, spitz dogs are indigenous to mostly cold and snowy regions. Norwegian Buhunds can either have black or wheaten fur, which can be several different tan hues.</p><p>These dogs are known for having energetic, fun-loving personalities that can pair with a variety of families and lifestyles. Norwegian Buhunds do especially well with active owners that love to take their dog along for new adventures together.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 17 to 18.5 inches (males); 16 to 17.5 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 31 to 40 pounds (males); 26 to 35 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Double coat with a thick, hard, and smooth-lying outercoat and a soft, dense undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Wheaten (ranges from pale cream to orange) or black</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, confident, friendly, affectionate, courageous</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Norway</p><h2>Characteristics of the Norwegian Buhund</h2><p>Norwegian Buhunds have gentle, cheery, and very affectionate personalities. These dogs want to be with their people, and they thrive when provided with ample daily exercise, mental stimulation, and attention. Norwegian Buhunds are loving and devoted to their families, including respectful children and other pets when raised together.</p><p>Breed fanciers report that these dogs are fun and full of character. They tend to ""sound the alarm"" by barking if they hear or sense anything strange afoot, making them good watchdogs but not ideal for apartments. For owners that are prepared to keep up with this breed's energy level, training needs, and daily exercise requirements, the Norwegian Buhund can be an exceptionally loving and well-mannered companion.</p><h2>History of the Norwegian Buhund</h2><p>The Norwegian Buhund is an ancient breed that has been around since before the Vikings, and it's likely that this breed was even kept by Vikings. According to the Norwegian Buhund Club of America, during the Gokstad Viking ship excavation in Norway, skeletons from six dogs resembling modern-day Norwegian Buhunds were discovered.</p><p>Norwegian Buhunds were used as versatile farm dogs, herding livestock and guarding their families, flocks, and homes. In fact, the name Buhund translates to ""farm dog"" in Norwegian. Although ancestors of the Norwegian Buhund were around for many centuries, the breed as it appears today was cultivated in the western coastland area of Norway. The first Norwegian Buhund dog show took place in Norway in 1920, and the Norsk Buhund Club was formed in 1939. Today in Norway, the breed is still used for its original purpose as a working farm dog.</p><h2>Norwegian Buhund Care</h2><p>Like most herding breeds, the Norwegian Buhund has a high energy level that requires significant daily exercise to stay happy and well-mannered at home. Although these dogs don't need much other than basic grooming, owners should be prepared for two heavy shedding seasons each year. This breed can be trained using positive reinforcement methods that keep new lessons entertaining.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Norwegian Buhunds are sturdy dogs with the strength, stamina, and energy to work all day long. Thanks to their history as farm workers, they still require lots of exercise to stay content at home. At least two hours per day of long walks, jogging, hiking, or games like fetch are good exercise options for this breed.</p><p>It's not enough to just exercise the Norwegian Buhund physically providing lots of mental stimulation is key. Without it, a Norwegian Buhund might just find his own ways to have a good time, which can lead to destructive behaviors like chewing. This active, agile, and intelligent breed will be eager to take it up a notch with competitive dog sports like agility, herding, and tracking. At the end of a long and action-packed day, most Norwegian Buhunds love to flop at their owner's feet and relax.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Norwegian Buhund's natural, easy-care coat only sheds moderately, making the breed a wonderful house pet in terms of stray hair. The fur naturally repels dirt, so it also stays clean and relatively odorless. Brushing your dog several times a week can help cut down on shedding. Twice a year, your Norwegian Buhund will ""blow coat,"" a term used to describe the heavy seasonal shedding periods where the dog drops much of its undercoat. During these times, brush daily to remove as much loose undercoat as you can.</p><p>The coat is typically longer on the neck, chest, and back of the thighs. This breed doesn't need haircuts, but its nails should be trimmed regularly. Check your dog's ears for waxy debris and clean them with a pet-safe ear cleaner as needed. It's also important to brush your dog's teeth consistently to prevent dental infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Norwegian Buhunds are intelligent, but they can be challenging to train. Although they do want to please you, they are also independent thinkers that can easily lose focus. Fun, positive training methods like clicker training with lots of tasty treats work best. Like all puppies, Norwegian Buhunds benefit from early, frequent training and socialization. The key to bringing out the best in your dogs is to train them with plenty of consistency (showing exactly what you expect from them) starting from the day you bring them home.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Norwegian Buhund is a relatively healthy breed, but like most purebred dogs, it can be susceptible to a few inherited health conditions. Reputable breeders test prospective parent dogs for these issues before breeding them to avoid passing on these problems. When adopting a Norwegian Buhund puppy from a breeder, always ask to see the litter's medical background.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your adult Norwegian Buhund measured meals on a morning and evening schedule (puppies should eat three or four small meals per day). Use a measuring cup or scale to ensure you are feeding the correct amounts. Free feeding can cause weight gain, which can put your dog at risk for health problems including joint disease and diabetes.</p><p>If you're not sure how much to feed your Norwegian Buhund or what kind of food is best, talk to your veterinarian or breeder. Your vet can help you determine the best nutrients and portion schedule throughout your dog's life based on its age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Norwegian Buhund</h2><p>Norwegian Buhunds are a very rare dog breed, so it's unlikely to find them in rescues. However, your local animal shelter can introduce you to similar dogs in need of forever homes that might just become your next best friend.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a Norwegian Buhund puppy, it's essential to do your research and work with a responsible breeder.

The dog's narrow head, long neck, and deep chest are also recognizable aspects of this breed. These physical characteristics make the greyhound the fastest breed in the world, with the ability to race at speeds upwards of 45 miles per hour.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Greyhound</h2><p>Greyhounds can make excellent companions for all kinds of people and even though these dogs are large, many do well with children. They are extremely affectionate with their families and may prefer not to be left alone. The dogs are rarely aggressive and respond well to strangers. Greyhounds are sensitive, requiring patience and understanding. It's best for these dogs to live in a peaceful household and be spoken to with kindness.</p><h2>History of the Greyhound</h2><p>Archaeological evidence of greyhound-like dogs dates back 8,000 years to the Middle East, making it one of the most ancient dog breeds. Much preferred by the ancient Egyptians, greyhounds were likely also owned by Romans and Greeks. By the ninth century, the breed could be found throughout Europe, and Spanish explorers brought them to the Americas in the 1500s.</p><p>Greyhounds were classically used for their hunting prowess and coursing. In addition, the greyhound is the first breed of dog mentioned in English literature over the centuries and was specifically mentioned in many of William Shakespeare's plays. Greyhounds also held a place in the hearts of English nobility, including King James 1 and Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, who owned a famous greyhound named Eos that happily appeared in many court portraits. The modern greyhound derives from dogs bred in England during the 18th and 19th centuries.</p><p>The greyhound was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. Shortly after, modern greyhound racing started in the 1920s in both the United States and England. The breed is typically not used for hunting in more modern times, and live game coursing and racing greyhounds is now illegal in many places. Even England's once-revered Waterloo Cup coursing meet is no longer in existence thanks to the Hunting Act of 2004 deeming it an act of cruelty.</p><p>The breed has experienced a surge in popularity in the U.S. since racing the dogs has stopped in many states and rescue organizations have begun to place retired racing greyhounds for adoption.</p><h2>Greyhound Care</h2><p>Greyhounds need a bit different care than other types of large dogs. You'll have to honor the greyhound's need for short stints of exercise rather than long hauls. Maintaining its coat is never a problem since it's short and smooth. Training will be your biggest challenge since this breed has a highly sensitive nature and will need help adapting to its new environment.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Contrary to popular belief, greyhounds are not usually hyperactive or overly energetic. Though excellent athletes, they can also be couch potatoes most of the day, and do very well living in apartments. They love to run, but a moderate amount of daily exercise, about an hour a day, including a 30-minute walk, should be enough to keep a greyhound motivated and fit.</p><p>Don't allow a greyhound off-leash, however, as they are prey-driven and will bolt away after small animals. It's best to have a fenced-in area where they can run around. When exercising your greyhound, remember that while they can tolerate hot weather, they will get chilled in cold weather because they lack body fat. You may need to provide a sweater for your pup in the winter while going on a walk.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The greyhound's short, smooth coat needs little grooming. The breed sheds at a low to moderate rate, so an occasional once-over with a soft brush or grooming mitt should be sufficient. The typical greyhound only needs occasional bathing. Trim their nails regularly, keeping them short to prevent slipping on slick floors. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and irritation. It is also good to pay attention to dental hygiene and brush your dog's teeth two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Both proper training and socialization are very important for greyhounds. Fortunately, most can learn and adjust well. Cats and other small animals may provoke their predatory instinct until they learn the animal is a family member.<br/></p><p>It helps to know when caring for a greyhound, that a rescued racing dog has had a very different life from the average companion dog. When a dog is not racing, it spends a lot of time in kennels and has usually never seen the inside of a typical home. The dog may be leash-trained but has typically not been exposed to things like stairs and glass doors, so it will need a bit of extra training.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Male greyhounds need 2.5 to 4 cups of dry food per day, and females need 1.5 to 3 cups. Divide this into two meals because they are prone to bloat, they are at risk of stomach torsion if they gulp their food or eat too much at once. It is common for them to gain 5 pounds after they retire from racing, but you should monitor your pet's weight to ensure it doesn't gain more than that. If your dog is putting on too much weight, discuss the proper diet with your veterinarian and get recommendations for feeding schedules, amounts, types of dog food, and exercise.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Greyhound</h2><p>Though greyhounds can sometimes be obtained from a breeder as puppies, the majority of available dogs are retired racers. Adopting a retired racer is a wonderful thing to do. If you would like to share your life with this unique dog breed, take the time to do your research first. Talk to your veterinarian, other greyhound owners, greyhound rescue groups, and reputable breeders to learn more. If you do go through a breeder, expect to pay between $1,500 to $2,500 for a purebred puppy.</p><p>The most likely place to adopt a greyhound is from a breed-specific rescue group.</p><p>The National Greyhound Association also offers a list of endorsed regional greyhound rescue groups on its website.</p><h2>Greyhound Overview</h2><p>Do not shed much or require a significant amount of grooming</p><p>Not in need of a lot of exercise, though they get spurts of energy once in a while</p><p>Docile dogs that are polite and sweet</p><p>Don't make good watchdogs, despite their large size</p><p>Fast runners, so can't be let off a leash</p><p>Can't spend a significant amount of time outside in cold weather because of temperature sensitivity</p>",1115

Today, the activity is still legal in Japan, and the breed continues to be used for this purpose. In most other parts of the world, where dog fighting is banned, the Tosa is a watchdog, guard dog, and companion. </p><p>Tosas can be quietly affectionate with their human families, but they are usually aloof with strangers. Tosas require extensive socialization to help them become accepting of welcome visitors. Due to their history of dog fighting, Tosas can also be aggressive toward other dogs, especially those they don't know. This breed is best suited for experienced owners who are prepared to commit the time and training that Tosas need to live happy, healthy lives.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Molossoid breeds, Mastiff type (FCI) </p><p>Height: 21.5 to 23.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 100 to 200 pounds       </p><p>Coat: Short, hard, and dense</p><p>Coat Color: Red, fawn, apricot, black, or brindle</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, courageous, alert, fearless, protective, calm</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Japan</p><h2>Characteristics of the Tosa Inu </h2><p>Though Tosa Inus are massive, powerful dogs, their temperament is also calm, quiet, and obedient. They are innately watchful and will alert their owners to anything deemed threatening or out of the ordinary. Although a Tosa might react aggressively toward a trespasser or a person threatening their home or family, they are not aggressive toward non-threatening humans. Tosas have gentle and tolerant personalities with children in the family who are taught to interact with the dog respectfully.</p><p>If raised together and socialized properly, Tosas might be able to live peacefully with other dogs that are members of the family. Keeping a pair of dogs of the opposite sex (one male and one female) is typically recommended, as they might be more likely to get along. Keeping Tosas with cats or other small pets is generally not advised.</p><h2>History of the Tosa Inu</h2><p>Dog fighting as a sport has a long history in Japan. The Tosa was purposefully created to be a larger, stronger, more skilled fighting dog than other breeds. Around the mid-19<sup>th</sup> century, Europeans introduced some of their prized fighting dogs to Japan. When Japanese dog fanciers saw the dogs' prowess, they began introducing them into lines of fighting dogs in Japan. The breeds used to create the Tosa include another Japanese breed, the Shikoku, as well as Western breeds that had been newly introduced to Japan, including bulldogs, Mastiffs, German pointers, Great Danes, and possibly other breeds. </p><p>The Tosa is not fully recognized by the American Kennel Club. However, it's part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service, which is a stepping stone toward eventual full registration. In North America, the Tosa is recognized by the United Kennel Club. Internationally, the breed is recognized and classified as a molossoid breed by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). </p><h2>Tosa Inu Care</h2><p>When it comes to exercise and grooming, the Tosa Inu dog is relatively low-maintenance. Training must be consistent, especially in puppyhood, and used in combination with socialization to help your dog acclimate to life at home and in public.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Tosa is rather athletic for a giant breed. However, exercise requirements fall in the moderate range. The Tosa needs daily exercise and mental stimulation in the form of long walks, hikes, or chasing after a toy or ball in your safely enclosed yard. Due to the breed's tendency toward dog aggression, you should always keep your Tosa secure on a leash when out of the home. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Tosa's coat is simple to care for. Its short, straight, dense fur lies tight to the body and needs no trimming, and it only sheds moderately. Brushing a few times a week can keep this under control. Trim your dog's nails every two weeks and check inside the ears periodically. If they appear dirty, clean them with a pet-safe ear cleaner and cotton balls or gauze squares. If you see redness or inflammation, have your dog examined by a veterinarian.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Although the Tosa is intelligent and wants to please its owner, the breed is self-assured and can be willful. Use firm-but-fair training methods, including positive-reinforcement training and consistently enforcing the rules. Early, frequent socialization in puppyhood is absolutely vital to reduce overprotectiveness. If your dog begins showing signs of aggression early on, seek an expert with experience in behavioral training. Ignoring these signs in puppies can lead to problems later in your dog's life; considering its large size, this can be especially dangerous when combined with aggression.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like all purebred dogs, the Tosa may be prone to developing certain genetically linked health conditions. Responsible breeders test their adult Tosas before breeding them to ensure they don't pass on undesirable health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Weighing between 100 and 200 pounds, Tosas are massive dogs. They eat a large volume of food, but it's important to monitor their portions. This is especially important in puppyhood. Giant breeds need slow and steady growth to prevent joint disorders like hip and elbow dysplasia.</p><p>Another important factor in the diets of giant-breed dogs is the timing of their meals. Your veterinarian might recommend feeding smaller portions of high-quality dog food several times throughout the day to prevent conditions like bloat, along with avoiding meals before or after exercise.</p><p>Excess weight, including canine obesity, can also lead to the development of other health conditions like diabetes. Ask your veterinarian to provide a suitable feeding schedule for your specific dog that considers their age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Tosa Inu</h2><p>Before embarking on Tosa ownership, check your country's laws. Due to its history of dog fighting, owning a Tosa is banned outright or legally restricted in certain countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Norway, Denmark, and more. Some states, cities, local governments, landlords, and insurance companies also exclude the Tosa. In Japan, the breed is used for dog fighting, but in other parts of the world, the Tosa is bred to be a show dog and companion.</p><p>This breed is rare, so finding a Tosa at a shelter or even through breeders can be a challenge. Large-breed rescues and local shelters are a great place to start your search. The price of puppies can range from $1,500 to $5,000, depending on their pedigree and your region. Be prepared to join a waiting list for a puppy.</p><p>The American Kennel Club maintains a list of breeders for all breeds, including those like the Tosa that are not yet fully recognized but are part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service.</p><h2>Tosa Inu Overview</h2><p>Easy-care coat</p><p>Calm and docile with its owner<br/></p><p>Excellent watch dog and guard dog</p><p>Dog- and animal-aggressive</p><p>Breed ownership is restricted in many countries</p><p>Requires abundant exercise, socialization, and training</p>",1118

The Manx came to the US in the 1920s, where it quickly became desirable after success as a show cat in England. They are highly social and playful, sometimes said to be dog-like in their loyalty and trainability. Nicknames for the cat vary depending on the Manx tail length. If your Manx has no tail, it is called a ""rumpy,"" while a Manx with a very slight tail is called a ""rumpy riser."" The loving, even-tempered Manx cat will likely get along with all family members and provide many years of affection and companionship.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Manks, Rumpy, Stubbin</p><p>Personality: Easygoing, affectionate, social</p><p>Weight: 8 to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: About 14 to 16 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair and long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: White, blue, black, red, cream, silver, brown</p><p>Coat Patterns: Bicolor, solid, tortoiseshell, tabby (among others)</p><p>Eye Color: Gold, copper, green, hazel, blue, or odd-eyed</p><p>Lifespan: 14 to 16 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Isle of Man</p><p><br/></p><h2>Manx Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The Manx cat is a unique-looking, affectionate, friendly cat. Manx owners love their cat's stubby tail and high trainability. They are known to hunt rodents and insects with precision, but their hunting instincts don't translate to an aggressive temperament toward humans. These cats are excellent jumpers, which may make for some frustration, but remember that the Manx cat's playful nature is a gift. The Manx cat has a wonderful personality and makes a great addition to any family. </p><h2>History of the Manx Cat</h2><p>The Manx is an ancient cat breed hailing from the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea. Initially, the breed name was typically spelled ""Manks"" or ""stubbin"" in colloquial terms on the Isle. Today, they are a substantial but declining percentage of the local cat population on the Isle of Man. Due to their hunting skills, Manx cats have historically been a popular choice by farmers to help with rodent problems and companions on sea voyages.</p><p>The many folktales about the Manx are rooted in the cat's characteristic lack of a long tail. Some folktales claim that a tailless cat swam ashore from a shipwreck and brought the trait to the island, while biblical references suggest that when Noah closed the door of the Ark, he accidentally cut off the tail of the Manx cat. Some people believed that any cat in close contact with a Manx could pass along its taillessness to its kittens. In actuality, the absence of a tail arises from a spontaneous genetic mutation.</p><p>The Manx was one of the original show cats in the first cat show held in Great Britain, with its first known breed standard published in 1903. The Manx was one of the founding breeds of the Cat Fancier's Association in 1908. The United States pedigreed cat registry has records on the breed in North America from the 1920s.</p><h2>Manx Cat Care</h2><p>The care needed for a Manx cat is typical of any domestic breed. It requires a moderate amount of exercise and a regular grooming routine. Knowing your cat's needs makes caregiving straightforward and effective.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Manx cat doesn't have unique exercise needs but benefits from 30 to 60 minutes of designated playtime due to its playful nature. Like many cats, the Manx loves to run, jump, and climb, so providing ample play opportunities will typically be enough to satisfy your cat's needs. Manx are natural hunters with sometimes dog-like characteristics, so your Manx will be engaged by small plush toys that mimic trapping and retrieving.</p><h3>Shedding</h3><p>Because of their double coat, Manx cats are prone to shedding, particularly in the spring and fall. A double coat occurs when a cat has an extra layer of fur to provide additional warmth and protection. All cats with double coats shed more than those with a single coat.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Weekly (but ideally, daily) brushing is essential to limiting a Manx cat's shedding. A longhaired Manx will require more intensive grooming than a shorthaired Manx, but a regular brushing schedule is important, no matter the coat length.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although generally healthy, the genetic abnormalities that lead to the Manx signature short tail are related to several health issues. The Manx is prone to a short spine that can fail to provide proper nerve and muscle endings. Typically, a Manx breeder will watch for health issues in the cat during the first four months of life. These health issues may include the following.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The appearance of the Manx cat is trademarked by its very short or non-existent tail. A Manx with no tail is called a ""rumpy,"" while those with short tails are called ""rumpy risers."" A Manx with a half-tail may be referred to as a ""longy.""</p><p>Manx are medium-sized and stocky, with flat flanks, sloping shoulders, and full chests. Typically, a Manx cat's hind legs are longer than its front legs, creating the appearance of an arched back. Manx have round heads, small noses, and large eyes and ears. Their eyes are usually a variation of a gold color.</p><p>Manx cats can have either long or short hair, but all have a dense, plush double coat. Short-haired is the more common variation of Manx and has an outer coat that is somewhat hard and glossy, while the long-haired variation has a silky coat that is medium in length. The coat pattern and color range widely and can incorporate elements found in all cat breeds because of cross-breeding. Manx cats commonly have a tortoiseshell, tabby, or solid coat. Although Manx cats are not hypoallergenic, some people with cat allergies have reported being somewhat less sensitive to Manx. The cat sheds slightly less than other breeds but is in no way entirely hypoallergenic.<br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all cats, the Manx requires a balanced diet of protein, vitamins and minerals, fats, and water. The cat food should include fish oils and omega-3 fatty acids to keep the thick Manx coat healthy. Amino acids are essential for vision and heart health, and fiber is necessary for digestion and weight control. A Manx cat does well on wet or dry commercially-prepared cat food, especially when meat is the first ingredient. Wet food may need to be warmed up, as Manx cats are not fond of chilled meals. Manx cats should not be given cow's milk, as the lactose can build up in the intestines and cause digestive issues.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Manx Cat</h2><p>You may be able to find a purebred Manx cat through a breeder in your area or through a shelter or adoption agency. A Manx from a breeder typically costs between 150 and 500 dollars, depending on the breed standards it meets.</p><h2>Types of Manx Cats</h2><p>The types of Manx cats are usually categorized by their tail lengths and coat length, but other consistent variants have been developed.</p><h2>Manx Cat Overview</h2><p>The Manx cat makes for an excellent pet. Its playful nature, sociability, and intelligence are compatible with all family configurations and are only sweetened by its unique physique. Before adopting or buying a Manx cat, be aware of potential health issues related to the shortened tail.</p><p>Active, playful, sturdy breed</p><p>Great mouser</p><p>Intelligent, highly trainable</p><p>Might be more predisposed to spinal problems</p><p>Likes high perches, might jump up to shelves, tables, or counters</p><p>Needs consistent grooming</p>",1204

Affectionately called ""Finkies,"" these dogs are animated, intelligent, and friendly. They make great additions to active families, as they're energetic, kid-friendly, and protective of their packs.</p><p>Pricked-up pointed ears and golden-red fur give the Finnish spitz a fox-like appearance. Thanks to its alert disposition, this breed also resembles the fox in its temperament. Finkies are stealthy hunters known to catch small game (like birds and squirrels) with ease. At home, this breed is a loving companion that gets along with people and other pets that it's familiar with.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting<br/></p><p>Height: 17 to 20 inches (males); 15 to 18 inches (females)<br/></p><p>Weight: 26 to 29 pounds (males); 15 to 22 pounds (females)<br/></p><p>Coat: Medium-length double coat<br/></p><p>Coat Color: Red-gold, solid red or gold<br/></p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, intelligent, playful, attentive, vocal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Finland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Finnish Spitz</h2><p>Finkies were bred to bark. Hunters taught them to alert when they spotted prey on a hunt in the countryside, but while barking may be desired in that setting, it's not always a desirable personality trait at home. It will take training to teach your Finnish spitz when it should and shouldn't bark. If you do decide to add this breed to your family, be prepared for its vocal nature.</p><p>This breed also loves to run. Potential owners should be active and eager to take at least one long walk, run, or hike each day. Extra play sessions are always welcome, especially when they involve children. Finkies are sharp as a tack; they learn quickly, but they can also be independent thinkers. Positive reward-based training is best to keep learning entertaining for these dogs. They're also a great breed for canine sports like agility training that provides both mental and physical stimulation.</p><h2>History of the Finnish Spitz</h2><p>Historians believe that dogs similar to the modern Finnish spitz were brought to Finland by migrating tribes from central Russia several thousand years ago. The migrants relied on these talented hunting dogs for food. For centuries, the spitz-like breeds were used as all-purpose hunters that eventually specialized in catching birds.</p><p>With the advancement of transportation infrastructure in the 18th century, the dogs were introduced to new areas, and they began mating with other breeds. As a result, the original Finnish spitz breed edged toward extinction.</p><p>Thankfully, these unique dogs had two dedicated admirers, Hugo Roos and Hugo Sandberg, who brought the Finnish spitz population back in the late 1800s. They spent decades selectively breeding dogs to achieve individuals reflective of today's breed. The Finnish Kennel Club recognized the Finnish spitz by the end of the century.</p><p>In the 1920s, Finland began exporting Finnish spitz dogs to England, where they first got their ""Finkie"" nickname. They arrived in America around 1960 and were recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1988.</p><h2>Finnish Spitz Care</h2><p>The Finnish spitz is a high-energy dog breed that requires plenty of activity. These dogs make great companions when exercised, socialized, and trained consistently. Their thick double coats don't need to be trimmed, but owners should be prepared for heavy shedding twice each year.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>In its native Finland, the Finnish spitz is still used primarily for hunting, while its role in America is more of a companion dog. Because the breed is built for long hunts, Finkies need considerable exercise (at least an hour total each day) to stay happy and healthy. Generally, they do best in a large home with a fenced yard, allowing them to run free and play for large parts of the day.</p><p>In addition to regular romps in the yard, Finkies need at least one 30-minute walk a day. They also make great running or hiking partners and will happily jog alongside a bicycle or skateboard. No matter your favorite form of exercise, your Finkie will love joining you.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Finnish spitz has a double coat that sheds heavily twice per year. Rather than biding time during shedding season and vacuuming up clumps of fur, the process can be sped up through thorough daily brushing. You can also ask your groomer about de-shedding options. Some shampoos do well at removing loose hairs, so de-shedding baths may be the way to go for you and your furry friend.</p><p>Finkies should only be bathed on an as-needed basis and typically don't require trims. Aside from shedding, this breed has relatively low-maintenance grooming needs.</p><p>If you plan on showing your Finkie, know that the breed standard is very specific. The American Kennel Club notes that its coat should never be trimmed (except for the feet) and should never be a solid color, but shaded without any color changes.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Finnish spitz requires special attention and consistent training before it can become the perfect companion. This breed is highly intelligent, which can present a challenge. Finkies tend to be independent thinkers. They respond best to positive reward-based training when sessions are short with lots of praise for desired behaviors. Basic obedience lessons can begin at eight weeks of age.</p><p>Early socialization is key to ensure your dog does well with strangers and animals outside of its household. Because the Finnish spitz was bred to alert hunters, your dog may need training to discourage excessive barking. Socialization can also help cut down on barking (especially at other dogs and people).</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While the Finnish spitz is a generally healthy dog breed, a few genetic health conditions can still arise. Responsible breeders will perform all available medical tests on the litter's parents to prevent passing problems down to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It's important to stick to a strict diet using high-quality dog food packed with lean protein for your Finnish spitz. Like many dogs, this breed can become overweight when fed too many treats or allowed scraps of human food. Adhere to a daily regimen of low-fat, high-protein kibble appropriate for your dog's age and size.</p><p>To prevent unnecessary weight gain and ensure your dog receives the proper nutrients, talk to your veterinarian. Together, you can create a diet plan based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Finnish Spitz</h2><p>If you're interested in the Finnish spitz, check with your local shelter to find this breed or a similar dog in need of a forever home. When adopting a dog, always ask the breeder or rescue for a certificate of health. Reputable breeders should provide information on health screenings for your dog and its parents, and rescues should provide current medical history.</p><p>The Finnish spitz is a rare dog breed in North America and can be difficult to find. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000, though prices may vary based on pedigree and availability. Prospective owners should be prepared to join a waiting list.</p><h2>Finnish Spitz Overview</h2><p>Very friendly with kids and family</p><p>Enjoys dog sports and agility training</p><p>Great companion for active owners</p><p>Tendency to bark excessively</p><p>Can be reserved toward strangers when not socialized</p><p>Heavy shedding season twice per year</p>",1169

There's something regal about these dogs, and it's not just that they were the preferred breed of Mary Queen of Scots. These distinctive-looking canines are sweet but particular, and they have proud personalities indicative of their aristocratic background. Small, elegant, and featuring long bangs that feather off their ears for a constantly well-coiffed look, Skye Terriers are unique dogs with a rich history and they have plenty to offer the right owner. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 10 inches (males); 9.5 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 35 to 45 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double coat with a soft undercoat and a long, straight, hard outercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, blue, cream, fawn, gray, silver, or platinum</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, loyal, intelligent, even-tempered, brave</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Scotland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Skye Terrier</h2><p>While the Skye Terrier is loyal and affectionate with its family, this breed is known for being standoffish toward those outside its close circle. However, that shouldn't be confused for shyness Skye Terriers are confident in themselves and tend to have a somewhat self-involved temperament. Like other terriers, these dogs are also independent and likely to follow their own desires. They often have dominant personalities, so although they can get along with other dogs when raised together, they typically prefer life in single-dog households. The Skye Terrier's stubborn habits mean that it isn't suitable for everyone, but for the right owner, this unique and beloved breed will become a devoted family member.</p><h2>History of the Skye Terrier</h2><p>Skye Terriers were first discovered on the Isle of Skye in Scotland, hence their name. Skye, located in Scotland's northern-most Inner Hebrides islands, is home to rugged landscapes where early Skye Terriers were prized for their abilities to assist farmers in protecting their livestock from local menaces like badgers and otters. Reports of Skye Terriers go back many centuries, including a mention in the 16th-century book by Johannes Caius.</p><p>In addition to their reputation as athletic hunters of local predators a common trait among their terrier peers Skye Terriers were also prized in more aristocratic circles. The breed was incredibly popular among the elites of Victorian England, keeping company not only with Mary Queen of Scots but Queen Victoria herself.</p><p>Unlike many other foreign-born breeds, Skye Terriers actually have a rather long history in the United States. The breed was first recognized by the American Kennel Club as early as 1887, due in part to their inclusion in the book by Vero Shaw, which piqued interest across the globe in these unique dogs. However, their popularity hasn't quite been sustained, and today, they're a lesser-known and rare breed. Still, these dignified dogs have maintained their regal air, and Skye Terriers can still be found occasionally in the competition circuit.</p><h2>Sky Terrier Care</h2><p>The Skye Terrier is relatively low-maintenance when it comes to exercising, but their independent nature and long hair mean that they require significant training and grooming care. Owners should prepare for ongoing lessons in obedience and regular brushings to keep their coats in good shape.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>For all their athleticism, Skye Terriers actually have low energy levels and do not require any sort of vigorous exercise to remain healthy. One or two short walks a day will generally suffice (about 30 minutes total), provided they're coupled with additional one-on-one playtime sessions with their humans. Skye Terriers do enjoy playing, and some of them also excel at dog sports like agility. Like other terriers, they're prone to digging, so it's also helpful for owners to provide a sandbox in the yard to let these dogs stay active while following their instincts.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>As for grooming, that luxurious feathered coat does require a fair deal of upkeep. This includes regular brushings and combings to prevent tangles and matting, which should be combed out with detangling spray very delicately should they appear. Owners should also plan to maintain general grooming practices like regular teeth brushing, nail trims, and ear cleaning.</p><p>Take extra care with keeping a Skye Terrier's ears clean in accordance with your veterinarian's recommendations, as having so much fur gathered around the ears makes this breed more prone to ear wax buildup and infections. Baths should be given on a regular schedule (about once a month; less in the winter), but be careful not to scrub too hard since this may cause mats to develop in the fur.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>In terms of training, Skye Terriers have a bit of a stubborn streak perhaps an offshoot of their regal past combined with their terrier traits. They're good-natured but strong-willed, and while they can be taught appropriate behaviors with positive training techniques, they won't always take to more intensive training (though it's always worth a try). Basic lessons should begin early when puppies are about eight weeks old. Always stick to positive reinforcement when training. These reserved dogs don't respond well to harsh words or body language, nor is negative reinforcement a proper or effective way to train any dog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Skye Terriers are generally healthy dogs. That said, their stature stocky and muscular with short legs does make them prone to orthopedic problems. They are also at risk to develop certain cancers, though this does not affect every dog in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The nutritional needs of Skye Terriers are the same as they are for most dogs, with this breed doing best on a high-quality diet with plenty of protein. Accommodate certain dietary needs if necessary, such as if your Skye Terrier is a puppy or senior or if it develops food allergies. Feel free to give your terrier plenty of healthy treats (remember, they respond well to positive reinforcement!), and talk to your veterinarian if you notice that your dog is gaining too much weight. Your veterinarian can help you determine a healthy meal and portion plan based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Skye Terrier</h2><p>While Skye Terriers are a very rare dog breed, it's still possible to adopt one of these dogs in need of a forever home. Breed-specific rescues exist to help Skye Terriers find families. If you're unable to rescue this breed in your area, your local shelter may also introduce you to similar terriers that can become your next best friend.</p><p>If you plan to adopt a Skye Terrier as a puppy, it's essential to do your research. Work with a responsible breeder who takes excellent care of their dogs and provides you with the litter's medical history. These puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $2,000, though prices may vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Skye Terrier Overview</h2><p>Great for apartment living</p><p>Unique personality and appearance</p><p>Excellent companion for the right owner</p><p>Not fond of cats, other dogs, or small children</p><p>Tendency to bark and dig</p><p>Can be stubborn and resist training</p>",1142

While they are known for their excellent dry land and water hunting skills, these dogs also make laid-back and affectionate companions. They have calm personalities and tend to get along well with respectful children and other dogs. Their low-shedding, hypoallergenic coats make this breed an ideal choice for owners with allergies. Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are fondly praised by breed enthusiasts for their humorous personalities and intentionally unkempt, lovable appearance.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 22 to 24 inches (males); 20 to 22 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds (males); 35 to 50 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Medium length, straight, wiry topcoat, and a fine, thick undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Steel gray with brown markings or combinations of brown, white, roan, and orange</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Gentle, loyal, alert, companionable, proud, friendly</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Netherlands</p><h2>Characteristics of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon</h2><p>The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is an excellent choice for a family dog, as it is especially loving toward its owners and gets along well with children. These dogs thrive with company; they can become very attached to their family members, and it is not uncommon for them to become your shadow, following you from room to room in the house. For this reason, they are best suited to a household where they will have company for most of the day. They can develop separation anxiety when left alone for too long on a regular basis.</p><p>While Wirehaired Pointing Griffons can make good watchdogs, their gentle personas mean they are not suited to be guard dogs. They may bark to let you know someone is approaching, but they tend to be loving and friendly at heart.</p><h2>History of the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon</h2><p>There is much debate about the true origins of this breed, with some believing they could have traces of dogs like Pointer, Spaniel, Otterhound, and Setter in their origins. Early examples of similar breeds could possibly be traced back to the 16th century, but their well-documented history began in the late 19th century.</p><p>A young Dutchman named Eduard Karel Korthals, who was an avid hunter, began developing the breed in an effort to produce a supreme and versatile hunting dog for those on foot. His dogs, beginning in the 1870s, are considered to be the main lineage of all Wirehaired Pointing Griffons today. They are often referred to as Korthals Griffons in parts of Europe in recognition of their history.</p><p>By the time of Korthals' death in 1896, the breed had grown in numbers and popularity across Europe. They were particularly popular in the Netherlands and France, where they were renowned as reliable, hard-working, and adaptable hunting dogs.</p><p>The first Wirehaired Pointing Griffon was introduced to North America in the late 19th century, and the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1916. To this day, they are still regarded as adaptable gun dogs, but they have also grown in popularity as affectionate and active companion dogs.</p><p>The Library of Congress</p><p>The Library of Congress</p><h2>Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Care</h2><p>As a breed that requires considerable exercise, the Wirehaired Pointing Griffon is well-suited to an active family home. Grooming and training are relatively easy for these dogs thanks to their low-maintenance coats and eagerness to please their owners.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are very active dogs that require plenty of daily exercise. Their intelligence, hard-working nature, and energetic personalities mean they are well suited to dog sports like agility and scent work trials. They will fit in well with a family that has a great love of the outdoors. This breed enjoys playing and spending time outside to expel its energy, whether chasing a ball in the backyard or joining its owners on a hike.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Wirehaired Pointing Griffon has a low-maintenance grooming regime. While no dog is truly non-shedding, it is very minimal for these dogs, so they often appeal to people that have allergies.</p><p>The hard, wiry outer coat has a naturally unkempt look about it, and it's accompanied by a charming mustache and bushy eyebrows. These dogs just need a weekly brush out and an occasional trim to prevent the coat from becoming too untidy, especially around the eyes.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed responds very well to positive training methods. With the right socialization and ongoing training, Wirehaired Pointing Griffons make excellent companions. Their hunting background means they may have a higher than normal prey drive, however, and care should be taken if introducing them to cats or other small furries.</p><p>This breed can sometimes be reserved around strangers, so it's best to introduce your dog to plenty of people and animals from puppyhood. Wirehaired Pointing Griffons also have a propensity towards alert barking, so this may require some work to ensure that it does not get out of control.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Wirehaired Pointing Griffons are considered a generally healthy breed. When adopting a puppy, it's important to find a breeder that performs appropriate health screens on potential parents to help minimize the chances of puppies developing a genetic condition.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with all dog breeds, you should feed your Wirehaired Pointing Griffon a high-quality and properly portion-controlled diet. Talk with your veterinarian to plan a healthy feeding schedule and specific portions suitable for your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><p>For large dogs that are prone to Bloat, it's also recommended to feed two to three smaller meals per day rather than one large portion. If you have a dog that gulps their food down in minutes, try feeding them from a slow-feeder bowl or interactive treat toy; this can increase the time it takes them to finish their meal and reduce health risks.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Wirehaired Pointing Griffon</h2><p>Check with your local shelters and rescues to find Wirehaired Pointing Griffons and similar breeds in need of forever homes. There are lots of deserving dogs in rescues across the country, and it can be an incredibly rewarding experience.</p><p>If you plan to adopt a puppy from a breeder, it's best to research credible breeders to increase your dog's chances of living a long, healthy life and growing up with the breed's ideal temperament. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000 from breeders, which may vary depending on their pedigree and availability in your area.</p><p>When adopting a purebred Wirehaired Pointing Griffon puppy, there are a few general rules of thumb to consider. You should be able to see the puppies together with their mother in a nurturing home environment, and they shouldn't be allowed to come home with you until they are at least eight weeks old.</p><h2>Wirehaired Pointing Griffon Overview</h2><p>Perfect in a home that is active or wants to pursue dog sports</p><p>Affectionate and easy-going</p><p>Minimal shedding</p><p>Can suffer from separation anxiety if left alone too much</p><p>Might be prone to alert barking</p><p>Can be sensitive</p>",1137

The breed, sometimes abbreviated to the nickname of PIO or flower dog, spans the spectrum in terms of size with some pups standing small and others much larger. It's known for its usually (but not always) totally hairless body and elegant, slim build. The Peruvian Inca orchid exhibits some features that are similar to other breeds particularly whippets and greyhounds and some characteristics that are all of its own.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Miscellaneous (AKC)</p><p>HEIGHT: 9.75 to 25.75 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 8.5 to 55 pounds</p><p>COAT: Hairless, very rare tufts of hair in spots</p><p>COAT COLOR: Any skin color; pink, black, brown, white, gray (coated)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, noble, alert, affectionate, lively, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Peru</p><h2>Characteristics of the Peruvian Inca Orchid</h2><p>What this breed tends to lack in fur, however, the Peruvian Inca orchid makes up for in personality. These flower dogs are affectionate, adaptable, athletic, and make lively and interesting pets.</p><h2>History of the Peruvian Inca Orchid</h2><p>As you might expect from their name, the Peruvian Inca orchid has a long and storied history, and might just be one of the earliest domesticated dog breeds known to humans. Early depictions of the Peruvian Inca orchid can be found in pottery dating back to 750 A.D., with pieces dedicated to the breed found among relics from the Incas, Chancay, and Chimu, all three of which were based in Peru.</p><p>Perhaps because of their standout looks, the Peruvian Inca orchid was lauded among ancient Peruvian tribes not just as a loyal animal companion but as a provider of healing properties (though on the latter point, it really does appear that the breed was a close companion to the tribespeople some pottery depictions of Peruvian Inca orchids even show them wearing sweaters!). Among the Chimu, the urine and feces of Peruvian Inca orchids were used in medicine, while the dogs themselves were thought to bring good health, and even to help treat conditions like arthritis.</p><p>The Peruvian Inca orchids of the ancient Peruvian tribes were small in size. However, that changed when the Spanish conquered Peru and began to breed the small Peruvian Inca orchids with their own, larger breeds. The result was the range of sizes seen in the breed today.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Peruvian Inca orchid wasn't always as celebrated as they were with the Incan, Chancay, and Chimu people. While they fared well in certain communities, they were viewed in urban areas to be diseased, largely due to their hairless features. Many did continue to have affection for them however, including an American named Jack Walklin, who in 1966 brought eight Peruvian Inca orchids back home with him following a visit to Peru. The breed name is credited to Walklin, as is the growth of popularity the breed experienced throughout the U.S. and Europe.</p><p>In 2001, the Peruvian government officially declared the Peruvian Inca orchid (referred to more often there as a Peruvian hairless dog) a National Patrimony, and the breed is now protected throughout the country. </p><h2>Peruvian Inca Orchid Care</h2><p>The Peruvian Inca orchid may be a medium-energy dog, but the breed still requires plenty of daily exercise and grooming to be at its best. Supervise your PIO around dogs, cats, and small children before you leave them alone together.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The PIO is a good apartment dog and takes well to indoor playtime and prefers a nice daily walk of 20 to 30 minutes. It also enjoys sports like lure coursing and agility, which is a great way to provide mental exercise in addition to physical.</p><p>Be careful to not walk your PIO in harsh, direct sunlight. This hairless dog cannot tolerate much direct sunlight. That's why it has other nicknames, including moon dog or moonflower dog, because this breed is best exercised when the sun is weakest.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>You won't have to worry about regular brushings with a Peruvian Inca orchid, though other steps are needed to protect and care for the dog's exposed skin. This includes the occasional bath, as well as sunscreen before heading outside and regular moisturizing when it's inside. Other good grooming practices to follow include monthly nail trims, as well as weekly ear cleanings and teeth brushing at least five days a week. If your Peruvian Inca orchid has a bit of hair, add a semi-regular brushing to the mix, too. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Caretakers need to dedicate time and patience to train their Peruvian Inca orchid, since the breed is both intelligent (read: stubborn) and difficult to socialize. Early socialization training is key for a well-balanced adult, and aggressive play is discouraged in the Peruvian Inca orchid's puppyhood since this can lead to bad behaviors later on. Engage in plenty of positive reinforcement training.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Peruvian Inca orchids are quite healthy dogs, with no known propensity for many genetic illnesses. However, all pure-bred dogs are prone to certain health conditions, and it's important to know what to look out for.</p><p>If buying a Peruvian Inca orchid from a breeder, ask if any of these issues have been witnessed in the breed line. Most health problems associated with PIOs are treatable and/or manageable, but it's good to know what you might be able to expect.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The nutritional needs of Peruvian Inca orchids are the same as they are for most dogs, with the breed doing best on a high-quality diet with plenty of protein. Feel free to give your PIO plenty of healthy treats, but keep them small if you notice any weight gain. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or notice that your dog is gaining too much weight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Peruvian Inca Orchid</h2><p>Flower dogs are rare, so you may not readily find one in a rescue situation, but it's not impossible. We always recommend looking at adoption first. If you happen to find a breeder of this dog (there are only a small handful in the U.S.), expect to pay between $2,000 to $4,000 per puppy.</p><p>If you do choose to purchase through a breeder, be sure to do your research and only work with someone who is reputable and takes excellent care of their dogs.</p><h2>Peruvian Inca Orchid Overview</h2><p>Good fit for apartments</p><p>Affectionate and loyal</p><p>Social and like to be around their people</p><p>Not inherently friendly to dogs, cats, or kids</p><p>Require specialized grooming care</p><p>Aren't particularly fond of strangers</p>",1055

Once exceedingly popular, the Sealyham is now one of the rarest terrier breeds. These dogs are notably calmer than other terriers. Known for their fun-loving and playful personalities, their terrier traits shine through their spirit, courage, and sometimes stubborn nature. While they may be difficult to find, Sealyham Terriers are unique dogs that make great family pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 10.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 23 to 24 pounds</p><p>Coat: Wiry, medium-length double coat with a soft undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: White; sometimes includes lemon, tan, chocolate, blue, or badger markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, friendly, courageous, outgoing, calm</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Wales</p><h2>Characteristics of the Sealyham Terrier</h2><p>Given the Sealyham's hunting background, it's no surprise that these dogs are known for being brave, adaptable, spunky, and full of character. They were also known for having companionable personalities toward their owners, and these loyal, affectionate traits remain present in the breed today. Sealyham Terriers love to play, and they can be very goofy and endearingly humorous. This is one of the traits that enthusiasts of the breed fall in love with.</p><p>While Sealyham Terriers do enjoy the company of their people, they can be reserved and sometimes suspicious of strangers. They often make excellent small guard dogs, although care should be taken not to let this characteristic get out of control. Like other terriers, they can be noisy alert barkers and are known to guard prized possessions and food. Sealyham Terriers may do well with respectful kids, but socialization is essential to prevent dominant temperament when these dogs are raised with other pets.<br/></p><h2>History of the Sealyham Terrier</h2><p>Originating in Wales, the Sealyham Terrier was once one of the most popular terriers. It is not clear why its population has increasingly declined, but these dogs are now considered an endangered breed despite their previous popularity as hunting companions and family pets.</p><p>Sealyham Terriers were first bred in the mid-1800s by an army captain named John Edwardes. Edwardes was looking for a small, robust, and brave dog that could support his Otterhound pack by flushing the animals out of their lairs. Otters were viewed as pests that drastically decreased fish populations in his estate rivers.</p><p>It is thought Edwardes may have crossed breeds like the Bull Terrier, West Highland Terrier, and possibly even Dandie Dinmonts and Corgis to create the Sealyham. There are, however, no official records to confirm their ancestors.</p><p>The breed got its name from the Sealy Ham estate that was owned by Edwardes. The original breed was thought to be slightly smaller and more feisty than its modern-day generations. The English Kennel Club officially recognized these terriers in 1910.</p><p>By the early- to mid-1900s, the breed became extremely popular in the United States. Sealyham Terriers were regular winners of high-profile dog shows and a favorite breed among famous movie stars. Some well-known owners included Elizabeth Taylor, Alfred Hitchcock, Gary Cooper, Humphrey Bogart, and even the Royal Family.</p><h2>Sealyham Terrier Care</h2><p>Sealyham Terriers are fairly low-maintenance when it comes to exercise, but their grooming and training needs mean that this breed is best for experienced owners. With the proper care, these dogs can be very well-mannered and happy companions.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Your Sealyham Terrier will do best with about an hour per day of moderate exercise. These dogs aren't the most energetic of the terrier breeds, so activities like walks, play sessions, or short jogs are typically sufficient to keep them in shape. Since they can be prone to digging, owners may also benefit from placing a sandbox in the backyard. This gives your dog an outlet for its instincts while allowing it to exercise on its own (and it also keeps your favorite flower beds safe).</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Sealyham Terriers have thick double coats with water-resistant qualities. These dogs don't shed much, but their coats can become matted and tangled if not brushed out regularly. Regular hand-stripping or fur trimming is also recommended.</p><p>These terriers are known for the large quantities of hair that grow forward from their forehead. While this signature tuft is a staple of the breed's look, it can also impede the dog's eyesight when left untrimmed. Owners should keep up with facial hair trimming as well as nail trimming, teeth brushing, and ear cleaning to keep their Sealyham Terriers healthy.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Sealyham Terriers are intelligent and respond very well to gentle training techniques involving positive reinforcement. Basic training can begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. Owners may need to put in additional training work for recall, digging, and minimizing problem barking.</p><p>To prevent resource guarding or other undesirable behaviors from surfacing, Sealyham Terriers need to be socialized from an early age. Care should also be taken when introducing them to other small animals. This breed's hunting background means it can have a high prey drive. At home, these terriers enjoy the affection of their owners, but they are also quite independent. They're known to have a typical terrier stubbornness about them, so working on obedience lessons throughout the dog's life is usually necessary.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Sealyham Terrier is generally regarded as a healthy breed, but it's still prone to a few inheritable health conditions. Ask your breeder to provide the litter's medical history and the results from any genetic tests to help increase the chances of your dog living a long, healthy life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Sealyham Terrier a diet of high-quality dog food, either commercially made or home-prepared under the supervision of your veterinarian. This breed is prone to weight gain, so it's important for owners to monitor their dog's weight by measuring portions and giving treats in moderation.</p><p>If your dog has food allergies, consult your veterinarian about the best types of food to maintain its health. Your vet can also help you determine a meal schedule based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Sealyham Terrier</h2><p>Because Sealyham Terriers are a very rare dog breed, it's not likely to find these dogs in most shelters. However, breed-specific rescues exist to help them find forever homes. You can also visit your local shelter to meet similar terrier breeds waiting for families in your area.</p><p>If you plan to adopt a Sealyham Terrier as a puppy, research responsible breeders and ensure you're provided with your new puppy's medical history.

The dog is best known for its classic terrier-shaped head, V-shaped floppy ears, erect tail, and a square, sturdy frame. It's also a strong-willed, sharp-witted, and energetic breed that is full of character. The dog's bold personality, however, means it may not be the best choice for a novice dog owner.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 23 to 24 inches (male), the female is slightly smaller</p><p>WEIGHT: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>COAT: Hard, wiry, dense, straight, short topcoat, with a softer undercoat</p><p>COAT COLOR: The head and ears are tan, and the body is a mix of tan and black or dark grizzle</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Outgoing, friendly, intelligent, alert, confident, courageous</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Airedale Terrier</h2><p>This handsome breed is often quoted as being the smartest of all the terriers. Their intelligence, combined with their independent streak, means that they have bags of character, but they can also be a challenge. In addition, if you're looking for a lapdog, the Airedale isn't for you. They're exceptionally loyal to their family, and they can be very affectionate, but it will be on their terms. They aren't natural-born snugglers.</p><h2>History of the Airedale Terrier</h2><p>The largest of all the terriers, the breed gets its name from the Aire Valley in Yorkshire, North England, where it was first developed as a versatile all-rounder.</p><p>During the middle of the 19th century, when the Industrial Revolution was booming, these dogs were bred by the working class factory workers and farmers of the area.</p><p>They're a mix of several breeds including the otterhound and the now-extinct black and tan terrier. They may also have traces of Bedlington and Irish terrier, among others in there, too.</p><p>Known for their adaptability, they were often employed to hunt out vermin like rats in factories and farms, and they would help herd and protect livestock on land and in water. In the early days, they would also often be used in rat hunting competitions held along the banks of the River Aire.</p><p>The first Airedales arrived in North America in the 1880s, where their skills as multi-purpose hunting companions were much appreciated. They were recognized by the AKC in 1888.</p><p>The bravery and intelligence of Airedales were utilized during World War I, and they often acted as lookouts, guard dogs, ratters, supply carriers, and messengers.</p><p>An Airedale called Jack was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for valor, after managing to deliver a crucial message for reinforcements, despite having been grievously injured by shrapnel.</p><p>They also served as police dogs, before they were replaced by more eager-to-please German shepherds.</p><p>Through the years, there have been many high-profile Airedale enthusiasts including Presidents Theodore Roosevelt and Warren Harding, and actor John Wayne.</p><h2>Airedale Terrier Care</h2><p>Airedale terriers will benefit from living in a household that has the time and energy to give them enough exercise to satisfy their athletic and high-spirited nature. While Airedales are usually very affectionate with their own family, they can be aloof with strangers, and their protective instincts can come out if provoked.</p><p>Airedales, like many terriers, also love to dig. If you have a pristine, well-manicured garden, you may want to work on training and provide additional enrichment in this space. A designated digging pit can be useful.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>An Airedale needs a minimum of an hour of exercise a day to burn off its energy. If it doesn't get enough stimulation, the dog will look for ways to keep itself entertained. Along with plenty of exercise, the dog would benefit from lots of other enrichment around the home.</p><p>Making sure you have lots of interactive and tough chew toys and that you'll have time to do short, fun training sessions, and other brain train games will greatly reduce the chance of any destructive or wild behavior.</p><p>If you're able to channel the Airedale's fierce intelligence, natural athleticism, and exuberant spirit appropriately, they can excel in dog sports or canicross. This can be a great way to keep them enriched and to strengthen the bond between you both.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Airedales don't have a high-maintenance grooming regime. They aren't prolific shedders either and a weekly brush out of their hard and wiry coat is usually enough to lift out any dead hairs and keep it in a healthy condition. Many Airedale owners have their dog's coat hand-stripped (removing dead hairs by hand) a few times a year to prevent it from becoming too thick and untidy-looking.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The owner of an Airedale will need to have a good understanding of dog behavior and training or be prepared to learn. The breed can be stubborn and very strong-willed and may also test an owner's patience with its antics.</p><p>You won't be able to force an Airedale to do something it doesn't want to, and it may begin to try to challenge you if you push it too far. It's much better to encourage the dog to make good choices using reward-based training methods.</p><p>As with many terriers, Airedales can have a high prey drive. You'll have to work hard to achieve a rock-solid recall, and you may have to keep them on-leash in areas where there's a lot of wildlife.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Airedale terriers are generally regarded as being robust and healthy but, as with any breed, they can be prone to certain inheritable health conditions.</p><p>Obtaining a puppy from a reputable breeder that performs health tests can reduce the risk of some of the known conditions developing, however, there are no guarantees a dog will be perfectly healthy.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Airedale terriers, with their deep chests, are more prone to developing gastric torsion, commonly referred to as bloat. This life-threatening condition occurs when the stomach twists abnormally.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions surrounding the causes and possible treatments but, for breeds at higher risk, feeding two or three smaller meals a day rather than one large one is recommended. Giving meals from a slow feeder or treat toy, if your dog is a fast eater, is also recommended.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Airedale Terrier</h2><p>Making sure that you select a puppy from a reputable breeder will greatly increase the chances of having a healthy and well-socialized pup. It also means you won't inadvertently be supporting the thriving cruel and unethical puppy farming trade.</p><p>Depending on the breeder, expect to pay $800 to $1,500 for an Airedale puppy.

They have a regal, intelligent, and loyal temperament, bonding closely with their owners and making wonderful family dogs. A well-trained Great Dane will thrive in most households. Your home does not need to be extra large to accommodate the dog's commanding size, but you do need some extra space (especially due to that long tail). Unfortunately, like other giant breeds, the lifespan of these dogs tends to be shorter than other canines. However, lovers of these calm, sweet dogs will tell you any amount of time with a Great Dane is worthwhile.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 30 to 34 inches (males); 28 to 32 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 120 to 200 pounds (males); 99 to 130 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, black and white, blue, brindle, fawn, harlequin, merle, silver, solid white, or mantle</p><p>Life Span: 6 to 8 years</p><p>Temperament: Calm, gentle, friendly, loving, even-tempered, attentive, proud</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany</p><h3>12 Giant Dog Breeds and What Makes Them Special</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Great Dane</h2><p>The Great Dane's temperament is true to its ""gentle giant"" nickname. These dogs are calm and laid-back both at home and in public when trained well, and their loving nature makes them affectionate members of the family. They are patient and get along easily with children, but as such a large breed, they can knock small children over accidentally simply by bumping into them. They are also not suitable to be handled on a leash by young kids. Great Danes are a good choice for multi-pet households, as they usually have friendly personalities with other animals (especially when raised together).</p><h2>History of the Great Dane</h2><p>Great Danes originated in Germany, although some believe the breed has ancient origins. They most likely emerged from the English Mastiff and Irish wolfhound. Despite having ""Dane"" in its name, the breed was actually developed in Germany as a boar hunter. The powerful boar required a similarly powerful dog for holding the prey until the hunter arrived.</p><p>Over time, the breed was no longer considered a hunting dog and became more known as a watchdog and companion. German breeders aimed to make them much less aggressive, which led to the gentle disposition common in most Great Danes today.</p><p>Great Danes appeared in the United States in the late 1800s and gradually became more popular over time. The breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1887.</p><p>Great Danes top the Guinness World Records list for the world's tallest dog. A recent record holder is Zeus at 44 inches tall at the shoulder. In popular culture, the cartoon Scooby-Doo and comic-strip character Marmaduke are both Great Danes. The breed has also been cast as the titular character in the film versions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's</p><h2>Great Dane Care</h2><p>Caring for your Great Dane is similar to other short-haired breeds of smaller sizes, but their large stature requires a few extra steps to keep them safe when it comes to exercise. It's also important to train this breed from a young age in basic obedience to raise a well-rounded dog that behaves well at maturity.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Great Danes are playful and energetic when young. To keep their growing bones and joints healthy, don't allow them to jump, and don't take them along for activities like running until they are at least 18 months old. As they age, most of these dogs have moderate energy levels. Routine exercise, such as daily walks, can help keep your dog fit and healthy. Since they aren't prone to fence jumping, most Great Danes can safely play in a fenced yard.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Great Danes have short, thick coats that typically need no more than basic grooming with weekly brushing. They shed especially heavily during the spring and fall. Great Danes need to bathe routinely, usually once or twice a month.</p><p>Danes with natural (floppy) ears should have routine ear checks and cleanings. While some people prefer to surgically crop the ears, this practice is becoming less common and is actually banned in some countries.</p><p>You should trim your dog's nails every couple of weeks to keep them healthy and prevent splitting or tearing. In order to maintain good oral hygiene, brush your dog's teeth at least a few times per week. This will help keep gum disease at bay.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Proper obedience training and socialization with others are absolutely essential for the Great Dane. The giant size of this breed makes it very difficult to manage if not properly trained. These dogs do not realize their large size, so careful attention should be placed upon the prevention of jumping, leaning, and leash pulling.</p><p>Great Danes are easy to housetrain and prefer to be indoors with the family rather than alone in the yard. Crate training with a crate specified for giant breeds is recommended.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit genetic conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can still occur in Great Danes.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It's important to start Great Dane puppies on large-breed puppy food to ensure they don't grow too fast (which can lead to dysplasia and other health problems down the road). Your veterinarian will likely recommend feeding your dog several smaller meals per day, rather than one to two large portions, to help prevent Bloat. Some Great Dane owners also choose to use slow-feeder bowls for this purpose.</p><p>Adult Great Danes require a lot of food up to 10 cups per day. However, take care not to overfeed this breed. Consult with your veterinarian to determine an appropriate diet and portion schedule based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level to avoid canine obesity.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Great Dane</h2><p>If you think you'd like to adopt a Great Dane, inquire with local shelters to see if there are any breed-specific rescues in your area. Unfortunately, there are many dogs who need a new home, as their original owners found they were not a good match. When planning to adopt from puppyhood, find a responsible breeder to help ensure your dog comes from a bloodline bred for health and temperament. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $2,000, but prices can be upwards of $6,000 depending on availability and pedigree.</p><h2>Great Dane Overview</h2><p>Great with kids</p><p>Gets along with other pets</p><p>Extremely loving and gentle</p><p>Shorter lifespan</p><p>More costly to feed</p><p>Requires strength to control on leash</p>",1109

Though the breed originated in Afghanistan (where the breed name was ), most of today's Afghan hounds are thought to have originated in early 20th century Great Britain. In addition to their striking appearance, Afghan hounds are known for their independence and self-confidence as well as their sweet, fairly quiet, and humorous nature around humans they are comfortable with.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: About 50 to 60 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, thick, and fine</p><p>COAT COLOR: Any color or combination of colors, including brindle and domino</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Dignified, silly, aloof, happy, independent, quiet</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Afghanistan</p><h2>Characteristics of the Afghan Hound</h2><p>It's tough to miss an Afghan hound when it trots by with its regal carriage, head held up high, and long locks swaying. This eye-catching breed is extremely self-confident, and with that comes a bit of a strong will and independent streak. When it wants, this hound can also act clownish, lazy, and a bit ditzy. This breed is highly sensitive to harsh commands, but still needs a gentle, but firm hand to guide its behavior.</p><h2>History of the Afghan Hound</h2><p>It is hard to pin down exactly when the Afghan hound first appeared, as its presence predates written history; however one of the first published descriptions of the breed appeared in a drawing by English soldier Thomas Duer Broughton when he was in India in 1809. Afghan hounds are considered one of nine ancient or ""basal"" breeds, meaning their DNA is more closely related to the dogs of ancient history than common contemporary breeds.</p><p>Afghans can be traced back to several regions in Afghanistan, with distinct differences in their coat and color depending on where they are from. Afghan hounds from mountainous areas have thick and dark coats while those from the desert have coats that are lighter in color and volume. For centuries, they have served as hunting companions for humans, who rely on them for their speed, quick and independent thinking, and panoramic vision common traits of all sighthounds.</p><p>Today's Afghans are primarily the result of breeding efforts made by the English in the 1920s. The breed had become a mainstay of British soldiers and noblemen in the early 1900s but almost died out during World War I, when resources shifted and it became difficult to breed and care for companion animals. In the mid-1920s, British military officers began bringing Afghan hounds to the West, and in 1927, the breed was registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC). By the 1980s, Afghan hounds in America had become mainstays of the show-dog and obedience circuits.</p><h2>Afghan Hound Care</h2><p>This breed has a somewhat high level of exercise and grooming needs due to its energy and long locks. After an Afghan hound has had the chance to run around, it will often be happy to settle in on the couch with its humans. Though brushing is a must for this dog, amazingly enough the Afghan's coat is almost dander-free, thanks to particles becoming trapped in its hair, a lack of an undercoat, and somewhat minimal shedding, which is why it's considered a hypoallergenic breed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Afghans need about two hours of daily exercise including walks or runs, as well as activities that make use of the Afghan's natural hunting drive, such as lure coursing. This breed loves to hike and swim, as well. It is also recommended that the Afghan has a chance to run off-leash in an enclosed area once or twice a week.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Due to their long coats, grooming is an essential part of an Afghan's care. Its fine and silky coat must be brushed regularly to prevent mats and tangles, though baths are only required as necessary. Brush an Afghan hound's coat multiple times per week to maintain its silky texture and reduce shedding.</p><p>Aside from frequent brushings, Afghan hound grooming requirements are relatively basic. Nails should be trimmed as needed and proper dental care provided on a regular basis. Long hair around their ears means that Afghan hounds are often prone to ear infections, so ears must be kept clean and checked regularly for signs of irritation or infection. Many Afghan owners tie the hair on their dog's head up in a top knot to prevent it from getting into their food or trapping bacteria around their ears.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Although they are known for their smarts, Afghan hounds can be aloof and stubborn when it comes to training. Unless the goal is to train for shows, obedience, or sport, most Afghan owners find it sufficient to stick to the basics of household training. Keep in mind that because their hunting drive is one of their strongest features, even the best trained Afghan hound may still refuse to listen to ""stay"" or ""come"" if they are on the pursuit of prey.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like all purebred dogs, Afghans are prone to specific health problems, though that does not mean that all dogs of the breed will experience them.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all dogs, Afghan hounds do best on a diet of high-quality, protein-heavy food. Adult Afghans should eat about 2 to 2.5 cups of dry food a day divided into two meals, though dry food can be supplemented in part or entirely by wet food. Afghan puppies, seniors, and those experiencing injury or illness have different nutrition needs, so it's important to get clear directions from a qualified vet when determining their diet. Limit food and increase exercise for adult Afghan hounds that are overweight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Afghan Hound</h2><p>If you're able to give an Afghan hound the high amount of attention and exercise it needs, this breed could be the perfect dog for you. But be sure to do your research to get a full idea of what life with an Afghan hound is like.</p><p>If you buy your Afghan from a breeder, expect to pay an average of $1,000 for this elegant dog. However, prestigious breeders may charge upwards of $2,500 to $5,000 for a show-worthy Afghan.</p><h2>Afghan Hound Overview</h2><p>Quiet breed, not a big barker</p><p>Sweet and gentle nature</p><p>Great chaser</p><p>Requires fair amount of grooming</p><p>Can be stubborn and has a tendency to be more self-directed</p><p>Long hair makes it prone to ear infections</p>",1048

In fact, the rough translation of its name is very descriptive of its appearance: ""Large, low, shaggy dog of the Vendéen (a region of France).""</p><p>The GBGV was originally developed to help hunt deer, boar, and other large game however, today, the GBGV's sweet personality and relatively calm demeanor make it the perfect pick for an active family or owners with other dogs. The GBGV is a pack dog, so they'll thrive in households with multiple dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 15.5 to 18 inches at the shoulder</p><p>Weight: 40 to 45 pounds</p><p>Coat: Rough, scruffy, and shaggy with extra length around the eyes and chin; double-coated with a long, rough outercoat and a soft, thick undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: A variety of colors, including tri-color, yellow, orange, black, and sable</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, energetic, loyal, lively, attentive, fearless, stubborn, sweet-tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen</h2><p>The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen was originally bred as a working dog, so they have higher energy levels and exercise needs. Like all hounds, the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen loves to follow their nose, so a fenced-in backyard or large, enclosed exercise space is a must. They tend to bark loudly and frequently and they can be stubborn, so obedience training beginning in early puppyhood is vital. Although the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is a smaller dog, they're not recommended for people who live in apartments or smaller spaces. If they aren't adequately exercised, they become bored and destructive.</p><h2>History of the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen</h2><p>One of the four Griffon Hounds developed over centuries, the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen was originally bred in Vendéen, a region in France, sometime during the 16th century. Their primary purpose was to help hunters track and takedown game despite their smaller stature, GBGVs were able to handle larger game, like boar and deer, in addition to smaller prey.</p><p>For many years, the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen was interbred with the Petit Basset Griffon Vendéen and the two were considered a single breed. In fact, the Club du Basset Griffon Vendéen, the official organization of Griffon Hounds from Vendéen, established the same breed standards for both the Grand and the Petit. Eventually, in 1909, the club reassessed the breed standards and recognized the Grand and Petit as two distinctive breeds. Over a century later, in 2018, the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen was officially recognized as a member of the Hound Group by the American Kennel Club.</p><h2>Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen Care</h2><p>The GBGV is a fairly low-maintenance dog in terms of grooming and care. They don't need much to thrive just plenty of exercise and occasional grooming. Your biggest struggle will come from training your dog. The GBGV is stubborn and can be resistant to training efforts, especially if you don't start them early and often.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is a very active breed and will benefit greatly from daily exercise. Playing games like fetch, hide and seek, or tug-o-war can help keep your dog healthy, fit, and engaged. If you talk your dog on walks or runs, make sure to always keep them on a leash their strong noses will tempt them away easily and you may lose sight of them otherwise.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Your GBGV should be brushed once per week with a slicker brush and comb and can be bathed as needed. Dental hygiene should also be an important part of your weekly grooming routine. Daily brushing is ideal, but brushing your dog's teeth even once per week can help protect them from oral disease.</p><p>Like all breeds, it's important to examine and clean your dog's ears every week. You can gently remove dirt, debris, or waxy build-up with a soft cotton cloth or pad. Cotton swabs aren't recommended, as they can damage the delicate inner-ear structures. If your dog's ears are excessively dirty, red, inflamed, or smell funny, contact your veterinarian immediately. These may be signs of an ear infection.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Obedience training is vital for GBGVs, who can be stubborn and have a mind of their own. If you're unfamiliar with dog training or obedience or a first-time dog owner the GBGV might not be the right breed for you. Be sure to keep training consistent, positive, and engaging, with plenty of rewards. It's important to note that, no matter how much you train your Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen, they will retain the urge to bark and chase prey if they're off-leash or in an open space.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like all breeds, the Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen may be susceptible to certain health conditions. They're typically considered healthy dogs and reputable breeders do everything they can to maintain the highest breed standards but there's no guarantee that your dog will or won't develop a health condition in their lifetime. It's important to be aware of these conditions, so you can take the steps needed if symptoms arise in your pet.</p><p>Some health conditions that are common among GBGVs include hip dysplasia, a genetic disorder characterized by weakening and pain in the hip joints, and dermatitis, also known as irritation of the skin. If you're worried about these conditions, or any other health issues in your dog, be sure to talk to your vet about steps you can take to give your pup a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your dog's diet will depend largely on its age and activity levels. Refer to the feeding chart on your preferred dog food or talk to your veterinarian if you're unsure how much to feed your Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen. Canine obesity can affect dogs of all ages and breeds, so it's important to feed your dog a healthy, balanced diet and take it easy on the treats. Canine obesity can be extremely dangerous and can lead to other health issues, like heart disease or diabetes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen</h2><p>The Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen is still a fairly rare breed in the United States. There are only a few hundred registered with the American Kennel Club, so it may be difficult to find one in your local shelter. If you work with a reputable breeder, there may be a long waiting list due to their rarity.</p><p>Before purchasing a puppy from a breeder, be sure to do your research and ensure they're ethical and reputable. Look for signs of backyard breeding, like unhealthy dogs, multiple litters at the same time, or the ability to pay with a credit card over the phone or online.</p><h2>Grand Basset Griffon Vendéen Overview</h2><p>Loyal, loving, and friendly</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming requirements</p><p>Ideal for active, outdoorsy families</p><p>Has a tendency to bark and chase prey</p><p>High exercise requirements and energy levels</p><p>Can be stubborn and difficult to train</p>",1129

This ancient breed was once revered in its native Tibet and thought to bring good luck to its owners. Tibetan Terriers were raised as companions for Buddhist monks, and they also made excellent guard dogs for the nomadic high-plateau herdsmen. Nowadays, with their affectionate and laid-back personalities, these dogs are popular as family pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 14 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 18 to 30 pounds (most commonly 20 to 24 pounds)</p><p>Coat: Soft, woolly undercoat; Dense, long, fine topcoat</p><p>Coat Color: Solid or any combinations of black, white, gold, brindle, and sable</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, even-tempered, playful, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Tibet</p><h2>Characteristics of the Tibetan Terrier</h2><p>The Tibetan Terrier is known for having a gentle, loving, and companionable personality that thrives with human company. These dogs make excellent family pets, providing the children are respectful and gentle. They also generally get along well with other dogs and can live peacefully with cats (if introductions are done carefully).</p><p>Because they rely on company and affection, this breed is best suited to a household where someone will be around most of the day. Tibetan Terriers typically have a calm temperament inside the home, but they're also happy to play and exercise with their family when opportunities are presented. Barking is a common trait in this breed, so owners should be prepared for a vocal dog and consider special training techniques if it becomes excessive.<br/></p><h2>History of the Tibetan Terrier</h2><p>The Tibetan Terrier's name is a bit misleading, as this breed isn't actually a Terrier at all. These dogs were given this name because of their size when they were introduced to Western countries. They do not have traditional terrier personality traits.</p><p>In their native Tibet, they're referred to as the Tsang Apso, which refers to the dogs' shaggy appearance. This thick coat helped to keep them warm in the cold, mountainous weather conditions of their origin.</p><p>The Tibetan Terrier's history is long, and it's believed that this breed was first introduced as far back as 2000 years ago in the remote Himalayan monasteries of Tibet. Buddhist monks kept them as companions, watchdogs, and as good luck charms. This also earned them the nickname 'Holy Dogs of Tibet' thanks to their owners.</p><p>This breed was never sold in ancient Tibet, but rather gifted to preserve luck. They were frequently owned by the nomadic herdsmen that traveled across the country's harsh, high plains. Tibetan Terriers also helped protect the herd and kept guard outside the tents at night.</p><p>The breed was first introduced to a wider audience when an English Doctor, Agnes R. H. Greig, was gifted a puppy by the grateful husband of a patient she treated. Once she was able to acquire another dog, she started a European breeding program in the 1920s. The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom recognized the breed in 1937.</p><p>Tibetan Terriers were first imported to the United States in the 1950s, and they gained official recognition by the AKC in 1973. The gentle and loving nature of these dogs has helped their continued popularity. Tibetan Terriers have also contributed to the development of other popular dog breeds like the Shih Tzu and the Lhasa Apso.</p><p>Bonnie Brock</p><h2>Tibetan Terrier Care</h2><p>Tibetan Terriers have average exercise requirements, but they need plenty of time with their families to thrive. Thankfully, training is relatively simple for these intelligent dogs. Grooming can be high-maintenance, so owners should be prepared to keep up with their dog's long, tangle-prone coat.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While they still require a decent amount of daily exercise and won't be averse to joining their owner on an adventurous hike, Tibetan Terriers aren't a high-energy dog breed. They won't need excessive amounts of exercise to stay stimulated and free from boredom, which makes them popular dogs for apartment living and owners without active lifestyles.</p><p>A few short walks each day (about 15 minutes each) should suffice to keep this breed healthy. While owners for this breed can be generally low-energy, it's important that they be home often to prevent their dog from developing separation anxiety.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Prospective owners need to be prepared for an intensive grooming schedule with a Tibetan Terrier. If you don't keep this dog's hair trimmed short, it can easily become tangled. These tangles can quickly develop into thick, uncomfortable mats, which will require professional help to remove.</p><p>Daily brushing is necessary to keep the Tibetan Terrier's coat in good condition. Detangling sprays are a great option to help the brush or comb move through your dog's coat freely and without pain when removing tangles.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Tibetan Terrier's history as a watchdog means that alert barking can sometimes be an issue. Thankfully, there are plenty of ways to discourage excessive barking if the habit grows.</p><p>This breed's intelligence and desire for attention make positive reinforcement training especially effective. Provide your dog with treats, toys, and affection as rewards for desired behavior during puppyhood. Basic obedience training can begin for Tibetan Terrier puppies as young as seven weeks old.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although they're known for their longevity, Tibetan Terriers, like most breeds, can be prone to certain genetic health problems. To increase your dog's chances of living a healthy life, only adopt from reputable breeders that perform health tests on prospective parent dogs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Tibetan Terrier high-quality dog food twice per day. It's also important to limit treats and be mindful of portion sizes to prevent excessive weight gain, as canine obesity can lead to other health problems in the future.</p><p>Talk with your veterinarian to determine a healthy diet and portion schedule for your specific dog based on its age, weight, and activity level. The best food for your Tibetan Terrier will vary throughout its life, as age-specific diets can provide the proper nutrients for various stages of life.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Tibetan Terrier</h2><p>While purebred Tibetan Terriers may be difficult to find in local rescues, check with shelters in your region to find similar breeds in need of forever homes. The process of rescuing a dog can be incredibly rewarding, and many dogs like Tibetan Terriers could be waiting to come home with you.</p><p>If you have your heart set on a Tibetan Terrier puppy, it's essential to research options in your area to find a responsible breeder. This will increase the chances of your puppy being happy, well-adjusted, and healthy. Ensure the breeder allows you to see the conditions their dogs are kept in, along with readily providing the medical history for the litter's parents. Puppies from breeders can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500, though prices can vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Tibetan Terrier Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and gentle</p><p>Well suited for apartment living</p><p>Gets along with respectful children and other pets</p><p>High-maintenance grooming requirements</p><p>Prone to alert barking</p><p>Needs owners who are home often to prevent separation anxiety</p>",1148

It's best to socialize this breed to help your dog maintain its friendly personality with new people. The Cairn Terrier's spirited nature can also lead to chasing other animals, sometimes getting into tussles with dogs and cats. Thankfully, if they're introduced carefully, these dogs can coexist happily in a multi-pet household.<br/></p><h2>History of the Cairn Terrier</h2><p>Cairn Terriers originate from the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. Their exact history is slightly blurry, as initially, many of these working dogs were referred to simply as Scotch Terriers. It wasn't until the 19th century that distinct individual breeds began to develop clearly, and the Cairn Terrier was one of these. They are closely related to the Scottish Terrier (Scottie) and the West Highland Terrier (Westie), and these breeds have similar appearances.</p><p>Cairn Terriers are believed to come from the Island of Skye, where they were used by farmers and gamekeepers to hunt rats and other vermin. They would often root out rodents from their hiding places under mounds of stones used as memorials or to mark boundaries (often at the top of hills). The mounds are called Cairns, and this is where the name for the breed is derived.</p><p>The American Kennel Club recognized the breed officially in 1913. The breed became even more popular when Terry the Cairn Terrier played Toto in the 1939 movie alongside Judy Garland.</p><p>Cairn Terriers have also been the pets of several famous figures.

Your Cairn Terrier needs considerable exercise and training, but grooming is fairly simple depending on your preferences for trimming the coat.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While it doesn't need extensive exercise, the Cairn Terrier still requires moderate levels of activity each day to stay happy and healthy. Plan for 30 minutes to an hour of exercise time, which can be completed through several daily walks or playtime in the backyard.</p><p>The playful nature of Cairn Terriers means they often get along well with children. Joining kids in games is a great way for your dog to stay entertained, along with activities like digging outside. If your dog's digging becomes excessive, consider placing a sandbox in the yard to allow digging in a specified area.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This hypoallergenic breed doesn't shed excessively. A weekly brush out should be enough to keep your dog's coat in good condition. Since their fur grows quickly, it can impede their vision and tangle easily if kept long. Some owners choose to have their coats hand-stripped to keep them tidy and comfortable. This technique, rather than clipping, ensures that the coat retains its condition and texture.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Cairns are very clever little dogs, but their independent temperament also means they can be strong-willed. This breed can be prone to barking excessively, so some owners train against this specific behavior. Ongoing positive reinforcement training is necessary to keep Cairns out of trouble; basic obedience lessons can begin when puppies are about eight weeks old. Their intelligence, tenacity, and energy levels help them excel in dog sports like agility training to burn off energy and build a strong bond with their owners.</p><p>While Cairn Terriers can live well in a multi-dog household, care should be taken if living alongside small animals like hamsters or rodents. Their heritage as ratting dogs has instilled a strong chase instinct in this breed. Because of these tendencies, owners may need to put extra work in to achieve a solid recall.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Cairns are generally regarded as a healthy breed that can live to a ripe old age. It is not uncommon for this breed to live past 15 years old. However, like all purebred dogs, Cairn Terriers are susceptible to hereditary health conditions. Adopting from a responsible breeder that performs genetic tests on prospective parents can help ensure your puppy lives a healthy life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Cairn Terrier high-quality dog food twice per day. Since this breed is prone to canine obesity, owners should monitor treats and meal portions to ensure your dog doesn't gain too much weight.</p><p>Like other breeds, your Cairn will also need various nutrients at different stages of life. Talk to your veterinarian to determine the best diet plan for your specific dog based on its age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cairn Terrier</h2><p>Breed-specific rescues for the Cairn Terrier are located in various parts of the United States, so prospective adopters should research local rescues to find Cairn Terriers in need of forever homes. Many similar dogs and mixed breeds can also be found at shelters, so it's helpful to meet the dogs in your region and see if your next best friend is waiting to come home with you.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a Cairn Terrier puppy, it's important to work with a responsible breeder. Adopters should be able to meet the litter's parents, see the conditions they live in, and learn about their family medical history. Puppies from breeders can cost anywhere from $1,000 to $2,500, but some prices can be as high as $5,000 depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Cairn Terrier Overview</h2><p>Family-friendly and playful</p><p>Adaptable to rural and urban life</p><p>Doesn't require extensive grooming</p><p>Some are vocal; may need training against excessive barking</p><p>Prone to chasing other animals</p><p>Can be prolific diggers</p>",1130

These dogs are loyal, bright, even-tempered, and most importantly, protective. Traditionally used as guardians for livestock, Kuvasz dogs are now more popular as loyal companions. Their history of defending herds of animals has largely influenced their modern protective instincts, and this breed is best suited for life in a single-dog household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 to 30 inches (males); 26 to 28 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 100 to 115 pounds (males); 70 to 90 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Thick, medium-length double coat; Ranges from straight to wavy</p><p>Coat Color: Solid white</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Protective, loyal, calm, intelligent, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Hungary<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Kuvasz</h2><p>While known for having affectionate personalities with their families, Kuvasz dogs are not regarded as a good choice for novice dog owners. Their size, strength, and working history mean they need confident guidance to ensure that their protective instincts do not cause problems.</p><p>Kuvasz dogs can have aloof and sometimes even suspicious temperaments toward strangers. It's important for owners of this breed to practice proper socialization early on. They are known to guard children in the home, and their high level of intelligence helps them learn quickly (though their stubborn streak can make training difficult at first). However, with the right training and care, these dogs are incredibly loyal and loving toward their owners.</p><h2>History of the Kuvasz</h2><p>The Kuvasz breed originated in Hungary, but with an ancient lineage. It is believed that its early heritage goes back to Tibet and Turkey. These dogs may have first been introduced by the Magyar tribes that came to Hungary over a thousand years ago.</p><p>The Kuvasz dog's more recent lineage can be traced back to the middle ages in Hungary. These hardy, courageous, and fiercely protective canines made excellent watchdogs for farm livestock. They were patient, calm, and capable of taking on hungry wolves and other large predators.</p><p>In the 1400s, Kuvs became the preferred dog of the king of Hungary, Matthias Corvinus. He used them for hunting and as guard dogs, and it is said that he trusted his dogs over his guardsman, even having a pack that slept in his bed chambers.</p><p>This royal approval meant the breed became highly prized by noblemen, and its popularity continued to grow. Vlad Dracula, the nobleman that many vampire legends are based upon, was even gifted a Kuvasz by the king.</p><p>During World War II, the breed practically disappeared. There were less than 30 recorded Kuvasz dogs left by the time the war ended. Breed enthusiasts in Hungary were responsible for helping save the Kuvasz from extinction, and to this day, it remains very popular in Hungary.</p><p>While they are not as popular in other countries, these dogs do have an enthusiastic following. They were first introduced to the United States in the 1930s and received official recognition by the AKC in 1993.</p><p>Library of Congress</p><h2>Kuvasz Care</h2><p>While the Kuvasz is fairly low-maintenance when it comes to exercise and grooming needs, this large guardian breed requires extensive training and socialization. This necessary step helps the Kuvasz become a well-mannered companion.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These large dogs need a home environment that offers enough space and daily exercise to prevent them from becoming bored. While it's not the most high-energy breed, the Kuvasz still needs daily walks or activity in the yard that amounts to at least an hour per day. This breed should not live in apartments, as its large size and average exercise requirements are best suited to homes with private, fenced-in yards.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Kuvasz dog's coat does not need much maintenance aside from basic grooming and regular baths. Twice per year, this breed sheds its thick, double coat, so it's best for owners to prepare with a de-shedding tool and several brushing per week.</p><p>In addition to caring for its coat, Kuvasz owners should check their dog's ears, trim its nails, and brush its teeth. Consistent dental care is an important step to prevent infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>With their brave spirits, Kuvasz dogs can be rather independent. Combined with their intelligence and sometimes sensitive demeanor, this means they need owners with patience and dedication for training. They respond well to force-free positive reinforcement methods.</p><p>The Kuvasz is unfailingly devoted to its family. These dogs are often very patient and gentle with children, though owners will need to teach children about being respectful of dogs in their household. It is also important to understand dog body language so owners can recognize any signs of discomfort before the dog resorts to aggression. A Kuvasz may be better suited to a home with older children to prevent young kids from accidentally being knocked over if bumped into by large pets.</p><p>Protective instincts can kick in when these dogs feel their families are threatened. Although they make excellent guard dogs, they can be threatening towards visiting guests. It's essential for Kuvasz puppies to be properly socialized from a young age, and ongoing training should be provided to prevent their guarding tendencies from taking over.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While the Kuvasz is considered a healthy breed, it is prone to several inheritable health concerns. Responsible breeders will screen prospective parent dogs for these conditions to avoid passing problems on to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Kuvasz a well-balanced, high-quality diet. Since this breed is prone to Bloat, it's important to feed several smaller meals per day rather than one large portion. Owners should also limit their dog's exercise before and after meals.</p><p>Large-breed dogs are also prone to joint and skeletal issues, but thankfully, helping your dog maintain a healthy weight throughout its life can minimize risk. Limit extra treats for your Kuvasz and talk to your veterinarian to determine a healthy diet and portion sizes for meals. This should be based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Kuvasz</h2><p>Since the Kuvasz is a rare dog breed in America, finding these dogs in shelters is usually unlikely. However, many similar dog breeds can be found at local rescues. The process of rescuing a dog can be incredibly rewarding, and your next best friend might be waiting to meet you.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a puppy, it's essential to research reputable breeders. Prospective owners should be able to meet the parents, see the environment the dogs are kept in, and see the litter's family medical history. Puppies can cost anywhere from $1,200 to $2,500, though prices may vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Kuvasz Overview</h2><p>Unfailingly loyal and intelligent</p><p>Good with children</p><p>Noble and calm in the home</p><p>Independent and can be aloof with strangers</p><p>Prone to over-guarding or aggression when not socialized</p><p>Needs extensive training; not for novice owners</p>",1108

This reserved and independent dog may have a rough or smooth coat. Rough-coated chows have a soft, wooly undercoat and a medium-length topcoat that is straight, dense, coarse, and very full. They have longer hairs (feathering) on the legs and tail, and a thick, long ""mane"" around the head and neck. Smooth chows also have a double coat, but it is much shorter. Though the breed sometimes has a reputation for being aggressive, most chows are faithful, calm dogs that make excellent companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 20 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 40 to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: Rough or smooth, double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, blue, cinnamon, cream, or red</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Aloof, independent, loyal, quiet, calm</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: China</p><h2>Characteristics of the Chow Chow</h2><p>The chow chow is a smart, independent, and sometimes aloof dog that tends to have a dominant and protective nature. The chow chow is definitely not the right breed for everyone but can be an excellent addition to the right home. This breed can work out well as a watchdog or guard dog. The chow chow tends to be a one-person dog, focusing its loyalties on the main owner. However, with proper training and socialization, the breed can get along with all family members including children, though a home with older kids will be a better fit.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Bear-like Chow Chow</h3><h2>History of the Chow Chow</h2><p>The chow chow is a native of China and among the most ancient of all dog breeds, dating back as early as 206 B.C. DNA analysis shows chows are in the branch that includes the shar-pei, Shiba Inu, and Akita, and are distinct from the lineage of all other dogs. They were used as temple guards in Asia. Though today's chow is a member of the non-sporting group, the breed was actually used for hunting over 2,000 years ago, as shown on bas-relief carvings.</p><p>This breed was called by several names in China, none of which were ""chow chow."" In the late 1700s, English merchants brought miscellaneous cargo from the Far East that they had called ""chow chow."" Because the dogs were sometimes a part of that cargo, the name eventually caught on. Queen Victoria helped popularize the breed and a breed club was formed in England in 1895.</p><p>Chows were brought to the U.S. in the late 1800s and were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1903. President Calvin Coolidge had two chows in the White House. Home guru Martha Stewart has had two chows that made television appearances on her lifestyle programs.</p><h2>Chow Chow Care</h2><p>This beautiful, devoted, and smart dog breed is beloved by many and can be an endearing companion. However, chow chows can often show aggression towards dogs of the same sex and, with their hunting background, may have a prey instinct directed towards cats and other small pets. As such, it is best that a chow chow only is brought into a multi-pet household as a puppy and raised with good attention to socialization so the dog accepts the other pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While not overly active or high-energy dogs, chows still need routine exercise to stay healthy and happy. A couple of 15- to 30-minute walks per day is a good place to start. They are not fans of vigorous romps, however. When exercising your chow, remember that it can tolerate cold weather well but it does not do well in hot weather. The dog will need a cool place, preferably indoors, when it is hot.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Regardless of what type of coat your chow chow has, routine basic grooming is essential. You will need to brush your dog two to three times per week. However, the rough coat variety will need much more maintenance to avoid tangles and matting. Chows shed a lot twice a year during a change of the seasons, and extra maintenance is necessary at these times, but generally, the rest of the time, the shed rate is low.</p><p>You will also want to trim your dog's nails every couple of weeks if they do not get worn down from activity. It is also good to pay attention to dental hygiene and brush your dog's teeth two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed needs an assertive owner who will provide discipline, socialization, and a solid foundation of obedience training. Poorly trained chows might act territorial and unfriendly, which unfortunately perpetuates the stereotype that they are aggressive by nature. Your chow needs to know that you are the boss in the household.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A chow chow should be fed twice per day with 1 to 1.5 cups of dog food at each meal. The amount will depend on your pet's size and activity level and will change through his life span. Be sure that your dog has access to fresh, clean water. By limiting the amount at each meal, you can help prevent your dog from gulping down food or eating too much, which can trigger bloating and possibly lead to stomach torsion, which is a medical emergency.</p><p>Be sure to monitor your dog's weight, which might be more than meets the eye under that voluminous coat of fur. Obesity will shorten a dog's life. Discuss a plan of action with your veterinarian if you find your dog is putting on extra pounds.</p><h2>Where to Buy or Adopt a Chow Chow</h2><p>Before you decide whether a chow chow is the right dog for you, be sure to do plenty of research. Talk to other chow chow owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more. And, if you are ready to get one, your best bet is to look to the national breed organization as a resource for reputable breeders and rescue organizations. Expect to pay a breeder between $1,000 to $4,000 for a chow chow puppy.</p><h2>Chow Chow Overview</h2><p>Low activity dog</p><p>Only sheds twice a year</p><p>Loyal dog, makes a good guard dog</p><p>Requires continuous grooming</p><p>The breed is prone to a few health issues</p><p>Can get territorial and aggressive if not trained properly</p><p><br/></p>",1060

This breed is quick, sweet, and energetic, and it's the smallest of Portugals' three Podengo breeds.</p><p>Podengos are one of Portugal's most popular types of purebreds, and they can be found in three sizes small, medium, and large which are not interbred with each other. Portuguese Podengo Pequenos are little dogs with a long name. The breed looks similar in appearance to American dogs like the Jack Russell Terrier and Rat Terrier, though interestingly, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno isn't a terrier at all. Other names for the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno include the Portuguese Warren Hound and the Portuguese Rabbit Dog. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 8 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 to 13 pounds</p><p>Coat: Either short and smooth or long and wiry</p><p>Coat Color: Black, yellow, fawn, gray, and chestnut</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, intelligent, friendly, energetic, companionable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Southern Europe</p><h2>Characteristics of the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno </h2><p>The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno has an active personality. Bred as rabbit hunters, these small dogs are known for their friendly temperament in households with multiple pets thanks to their pack-minded nature. They typically get along well with children and enjoy exercising, whether it be joining their owners on hikes or playing outside with kids. However, it's important to be mindful of the Podengo's tendency to follow its nose: This breed is likely to chase after small animals or dig, so it's best to keep them on a leash or safely inside a secure fence.</p><h2>History of the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno</h2><p>The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is an ancient breed, thought to be brought to the coastal country of Portugal a neighbor of Spain by traders (and invaders) who came to the area from places like Rome. And in fact, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno's lineage can be traced as far back as 600 B.C., when they lived amongst the Romans and Phoenicians.</p><p>While they might not be native to Portugal, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno earned their name by becoming a fast favorite among the people there. As you might expect from a dog that is also referred to as the Portuguese Rabbit Dog, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno has a special knack for capturing and killing rabbits, and it was thus instantly valuable to the local population. Their impressive hunting skills were also put to use aboard many of the 15-century ships that sailed from the Portuguese coast to the Americas, since the same features that make them excellent rabbit hunters also make the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno a successful rodent hunter in general.</p><p>Despite their early travels across the Atlantic Ocean, it doesn't appear that the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno made much of a mark in the Americas to start. It wasn't until 2011 that the breed was formally recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), where they were first placed into the Miscellaneous Class before being re-designated into the Hound Group in 2013.</p><h2>Portuguese Podengo Pequeno Care</h2><p>When caring for this breed, the most important elements to remember are to provide them with plenty of opportunities for exercise, positive reinforcement-based training, and basic grooming. Grooming typically includes routine steps, but will also require regular brushing when it comes to the long-haired dogs of this breed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is an active dog. As a family pet, they're probably not going to do any rabbit hunting, but they'll still need to have somewhere to channel all that energy. Long daily walks are key, and having a spacious fenced-in backyard is also ideal for this breed (though not a requirement, so long as they're getting plenty of other activity every day). Speaking of that fence, it's important: Portuguese Podengo Pequenos are quick to follow their noses, and if they get on the hunt, they're hard to stop.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming a Portuguese Podengo Pequeno doesn't require a lot of work. Follow a standard bathing schedule (about once a month should suffice) and be sure to comb out their coat after the bath if it's wiry. Otherwise, your dog's fur might become tangled. Other good grooming practices to follow include monthly nail trims, weekly ear cleanings, and teeth brushing at least five days a week. If your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno has long and/or wiry hair, add a regular brushing to the mix, too.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>As for training, the Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is intelligent and driven. This breed tends to excel as a training subject. Use positive reinforcement-based training only, encouraging positive behaviors and ignoring negative behaviors. A well-trained, well-socialized Portuguese Podengo Pequeno will be friendly toward strangers and other dogs, and will also make an excellent family member.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Portuguese Podengo Pequenos are typically healthy dogs. However, all purebred dogs are prone to certain health conditions, and it's important to know what to look out for.</p><p>If adopting your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno from a breeder, ask if any of these issues have been witnessed in the breed line. The health problems associated with Portuguese Podengo Pequenos are treatable and/or manageable, but it's important to be proactive to reduce the severity of these conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The nutritional needs of Portuguese Podengo Pequenos are the same as they are for most dogs, with the breed doing best on a high-quality diet with plenty of protein. Accommodate certain dietary needs if necessary, such as if your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno is a puppy or senior. This breed should be fed twice per day until it reaches maturity, then after consulting your veterinarian can sometimes be fed once per day as adults.</p><p>Feel free to give your Portuguese Podengo Pequeno plenty of healthy treats, but keep them small if you notice any weight gain. Talk to your veterinarian if you have any questions or notice that your dog is gaining too much weight.</p>",966

Once relegated solely to its home state (and in fact, the official dog of South Carolina), the Boykin Spaniel is growing in popularity nationwide as a breed that's as loyal and lovable as it is intelligent and trainable.</p><p>These affable dogs are easily identifiable by their luscious brown locks and honey-gold eyes, and their webbed toes make them excellent swimming partners. Originally bred in South Carolina to hunt and retrieve waterfowl among the state's many swamps and lakes, Boykin Spaniels have recently found themselves out of the swamp and in suburban backyards, edging ever closer to the ubiquity of their Cocker Spaniel and Springer Spaniel peers. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting<br/></p><p>Height: 16 to 18 inches (males); 14 to 16 inches (females)<br/>Weight: 30 to 40 pounds (males); 25 to 35 pounds (females)<br/>Coat: Waterproof double coat with wavy topcoat</p><p>Coat Color: Solid liver brown<br/>Life Span: 14 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, friendly, bright, active, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: South Carolina</p><h2>Characteristics of the Boykin Spaniel</h2><p>The Boykin Spaniel has an energetic personality and lots of love to give. Because of its background in hunting, this breed is best suited for owners that can spend plenty of time with their dog and bring it along for outdoor activities. A loyal companion with an affectionate temperament, Boykin Spaniels are a great choice for active families with children. They typically do well with other dogs and pets like cats (especially when socialized from a young age). These highly trainable dogs are eager to learn, making excellent hunting partners and favorable pets for those who can provide the proper care.</p><h2>History of the Boykin Spaniel</h2><p>Deep in the heart of South Carolina, native birds run rampant in swamps, lakes, and other natural bodies of water. For a long time, it was also the only place you'd find the Boykin Spaniel. This breed excels in sporting tasks like hunting, swimming, and water retrieving. The origins of its name can be traced to Boykin, South Carolina, a small town with a population of fewer than 200 people.</p><p>The Boykin Spaniel's history starts in the year 1900 outside of a church in Spartanburg, South Carolina, when a man named Alexander White spotted a small brown dog alone. White took him in and named him Dumpy, soon realizing that Dumpy was as eager a sporting dog as his retrievers.</p><p>Interested to see what Dumpy was capable of, White sent him to train with Whit Boykin, both the town's founder and an avid dog trainer. Boykin was so impressed that he started a cross-breeding program with Dumpy and a range of other Spaniels, including Cocker Spaniels, English Springer Spaniels, and American Water Spaniels. Thus, the Boykin Spaniel was born.</p><p>For decades, Boykin Spaniels remained relegated to Boykin itself, where they were celebrated for their boundless energy and enthusiasm, their sweet and friendly nature, and their affinity for hunting and retrieving. It took a long time to populate the new breed, but these dogs were also considered one of the town's best-kept secrets one that they weren't quite ready to share with the world.</p><p>News of the Boykin Spaniel eventually spread thanks to their sweet-natured personalities and athleticism. While Boykins are now popular across the country, their origin was commemorated by being named the South Carolina state dog in the 1980s. This breed was added to the AKC's ""All-American"" dog roster in 2009, and the state celebrates Boykin Spaniel day each year on September 1.</p><h2>Boykin Spaniel Care</h2><p>Boykin Spaniels are known for being easy to train, which is one of many reasons they've become popular family dogs. When it comes to exercise, however, this breed needs an owner with plenty of time to dedicate to its wellbeing. Boykin Spaniels also require standard grooming to maintain their soft, medium-length coats.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Most sporting breeds won't be satisfied with a short walk around the block each day. Boykin Spaniels are high-energy dogs that need one to two hours of daily exercise to stay happy and healthy, which makes them excellent companions for dog parents who like to hike, swim, bike, and run. Many Boykins also enjoy mentally stimulating activities like nose work, agility sports, and obedience training.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>With medium-length fur that's not prone to matting or tangles, grooming your Boykin Spaniel is relatively simple. Regular brushings and baths are encouraged, as is keeping up with dental care. The fur on this breed's ears is long, so give the ears a bit of extra attention with regular cleanings. Remember to gently comb through your dog's fur and check for ticks after outdoor romps. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Boykin Spaniels have a knack for learning. This breed is smart with a great capacity for picking up new tricks and skills. Because they love to please their caregivers, you're unlikely to face a lot of resistance when training your Boykin. With treats and plenty of positive reinforcement, you can train this dog to be a well-mannered companion from the age of eight weeks.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Genetic illnesses may be found in any purebred dog, and this includes the Boykin Spaniel. Responsible breeders will have medical evaluations performed before breeding their dogs to reduce the risk of passing diseases on to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like most dogs, Boykins do their best on a high-quality, high-protein diet. To maintain its ideal sleek and athletic frame, be careful not to overfeed your dog. However, since Boykin Spaniels should be getting plenty of exercise, owners that keep up with their dog's activity needs can usually feed them a few extra treats.</p><p>These dogs should eat two meals per day. If you notice your Boykin gaining too much weight, talk to your veterinarian to come up with a balanced nutrition plan that fits your dog's individual needs. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Boykin Spaniel</h2><p>The high energy level of Boykin Spaniels also means that not all owners are prepared to raise these dogs when they first adopt them, so like many others, this breed can end up in shelters. Seek breed-specific rescues and visit your local shelter to adopt a Boykin Spaniel in need of a forever home.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a puppy, ensure the breeder you choose willingly provides the medical history of the litter's parents. Boykin Spaniel puppies typically cost between $700 and $1,500 from breeders, though prices may be higher depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Boykin Spaniel Overview</h2><p>Great with children</p><p>Perfect companion for active families and hunters</p><p>Easy to train</p><p>Requires excessive mental and physical stimulation</p><p>Needs regular brushing to maintain coat</p><p>Can become destructive when bored</p>",1095

Since Pharaoh Hounds have such a friendly temperament with humans, they're more likely to engage a stranger in play than to guard the home front.</p><h2>History of the Pharaoh Hound</h2><p>One of the oldest recorded dog breeds, the Pharaoh Hound originated in Egypt thousands of years ago. Evidence of the breed's ancient history lives on today in beautiful works of art depicting Pharaoh Hounds. These sculptures and paintings found in Egyptian temples date as far back as 4400 B.C. </p><p>At some point in history, the Pharaoh Hound was brought to the Mediterranean island of Malta, possibly by the Phoenicians, where the dogs were used to hunt rabbits. The Pharaoh Hound has been known in Malta for more than 2,000 years, where it has remained virtually unchanged from its ancestors that are seen decorating Egyptian tombs. Today, the Pharaoh Hound is the national hound of Malta. It was first registered with the American Kennel Club in 1983 and is now a member of the Hound Group. </p><h2>Pharaoh Hound Care</h2><p>Caring for a Pharaoh Hound is similar to other hound breeds, as these dogs require plenty of exercise but minimal grooming to stay happy and healthy. When it comes to training, this intelligent breed can learn new things with positive-reinforcement methods, though it has a stubborn streak that may prove difficult at first.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Pharaoh Hound was born to run, and it needs appropriate outlets for this abundant energy. Provide daily running opportunities in a safely enclosed area, and include one or two daily walks in your routine as well. Younger dogs will need to stretch their legs more frequently (three or four times a day), but older Pharaoh Hounds can usually be satisfied with about 30 minutes of exercise per day.</p><p>When getting enough activity, Pharaoh Hounds are generally content to spend the rest of their day relaxing at home, perhaps with an impromptu play session indoors. A great outlet for Pharaoh Hounds is the canine sport of lure coursing (chasing a fake rabbit across a field).</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Pharaoh Hound's short, fine coat sheds very little. Truly ""wash and wear,"" the Pharaoh Hound requires little brushing and infrequent bathing. A simple weekly wipe down over the body with a damp cloth is often all that is needed to keep the coat glossy. Pharaoh Hounds do not typically have doggie odor, so bathe only when dirty. Clean the ears weekly with a pet-safe ear cleaner and trim the nails regularly.</p><p>Because the Pharaoh Hound's coat is very thin, they do not tolerate cold well. It's recommended to provide extra cold-weather care for this breed. They cannot be left outside in cold weather, and many Pharaoh Hound owners outfit their dogs in warm coats for winter walks. Even indoors, Pharaoh Hounds feel the chill of winter; fleece jackets or even flannel pajamas are recommended by the Pharaoh Hound Club of America, which is the national parent club for the breed in the United States. These dogs also love to snuggle under a blanket with their owners to keep warm. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Although highly intelligent, Pharaoh Hounds aren't particularly obedient in the sense that they are independent-minded and won't just do something because you ask. Training must be entertaining and fun. Make it a game and use positive methods with plenty of treats, toys, or playtime as rewards for your Pharaoh Hound to thrive. Basic obedience training can begin when puppies are eight weeks old.</p><p>Pharaoh Hounds have a high prey drive and will chase after anything they see or smell. Because of this, Pharaoh Hounds can never be off-leash or they may run away, possibly into dangerous situations like oncoming traffic. While consistent training can help improve your dog's recall skills, it's best to keep your Pharaoh Hound on a leash or in a safely enclosed fence for exercise, play, and training sessions. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Pharaoh Hound is exceptionally healthy for a purebred dog, though some common problems may arise in this breed. Responsible breeders will complete all relevant medical tests for their dogs to prevent parents from passing problems down to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Pharaoh Hound high-quality dog food with plenty of protein. Since this breed is prone to Bloat, it's best to feed several smaller meals throughout the day rather than free-feeding. This can also help prevent weight gain, which could contribute to other health issues in the future if not dealt with early on.</p><p>Consult your veterinarian to determine a healthy diet and portion schedule for your Pharaoh Hound based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pharaoh Hound</h2><p>While it's an especially rare dog breed, some adult Pharaoh Hounds or Pharaoh mixes end up in rescues occasionally. Check your local shelters or breed-specific rescues in your region to give a Pharaoh Hound or similar breed a forever home.</p><p>If you'd like to adopt a puppy, research reputable breeders who readily provide the medical history of the litter's family and allow you to meet the parent dogs. Since these puppies are hard to find, they can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $5,000 depending on their pedigree and availability. Prospective adopters should be prepared to join a waiting list or travel for breeder puppies.</p><h2>Pharaoh Hound Overview</h2><p>Family-friendly, playful with kids</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>Calm in the house when properly exercised</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Not reliable off-leash</p><p>Needs considerable exercise to stay healthy</p>",1119

The Maine Coon might appear intimidating to some, but this breed is a gentle giant with a sweet, laid-back personality. Brown tabby Maine Coons are perhaps the most recognizable, but the Maine Coon comes in almost any color and pattern, aside from chocolate, lavender, and the Himalayan (pointed) pattern. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>OTHER NAMES: Gentle Giant.</p><p>PERSONALITY: Amiable, gentle and dog-like.</p><p>WEIGHT: Average of 9 to 18 pounds; males can weigh 20 pounds or more.</p><p>LENGTH: About 19 to 30 inches. </p><p>COAT LENGTH: Heavy and shaggy. Silky with coat falling smoothly.</p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid (white, black, blue, red and cream), tabby (classic, mackerel and ticked), bi-color (black and white, blue and white, red and white, cream and white), parti-color (tortoiseshell and blue-cream), parti-color and white (calico, tortoiseshell and white, blue-cream and white), shaded and smoke, and shaded/smoke and white.</p><p>EYE COLOR: Varies according to coat color, but may be green, gold, green-gold, copper, blue or odd-eyed.</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 12 to 15 years.</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No.</p><p>ORIGIN: United States.</p><h2>Characteristics of the Maine Coon Cat</h2><p>Said to be dog-like in disposition, the Maine Coon cat is intelligent, friendly and gentle. Laid-back and self-assured, Maine Coons take everything in stride and are great playmates for gentle children. They coexist peacefully with other household pets, including other cats and cat-friendly dogs. Maine Coons are sociable and inquisitive, and can usually be found wherever the action is in the house, inserting themselves into every interesting situation. The Maine Coon is a talkative but not overly loud, expressing itself through a variety of soft and melodious meows, chirps, and trills. They are quite trainable cats and enjoy learning tricks, responding well to positive training methods and tasty food treats. Despite the old stereotype, Maine Coons actually love water, and will play in it, bathe in it, and dip their food in it and even swim. </p><h2>History of the Maine Coon Cat</h2><p>The Maine Coon developed naturally in the Northeastern United States. Though many legends persist about the Maine Coon having be bred from bobcats or raccoons, they are 100% housecat, descending from cats brought to American by settlers. The breed evolved to be quite large and hardy, with a thick, shaggy coat. These traits were necessarily for the cats to survive and thrive the harsh winters of the region. Although Maine Coon-type cats were likely known throughout New England, they were especially popular in the state of Maine. Beginning around the 1860s, some farmers began exhibiting their prized ""coon cats"" at the Skowhegan Fair, which is the nation's oldest consecutively held agricultural fair, dating back to 1818. Here, the predecessors to today's modern Maine Coon breed competed for the title of Maine State Champion Coon Cat.<br/></p><p>A female brown tabby Maine Coon named Cosey won what is regarded as the first American cat show, held at Madison Square Garden in New York City on May 8, 1895. The Cat Fanciers' Association's first stud book and breed registry from 1908 lists the Maine Coon as a foundation breed (listed as ""Maine Cats""). The breed is also recognized by the International Cat Association. The Maine Coon was designated as the state cat of Maine in 1985.<br/></p><h2>Maine Coon Cat Care </h2><p>The Maine Coon cat's long, shaggy coat is silky and slightly oily, a helpful feature that makes the coat water-resistant, allowing it to repel rain and snow, keeping the cat warmer and drier in inclement weather. Though long, the coat doesn't shed excessively as long as you thoroughly brush and comb the cat regularly, at least once weekly. Bathe occasionally to help the coat look and feel clean. Your Maine Coon probably won't mind getting scrubbed down since most enjoy playing in water. Trim your Maine Coon's nails weekly to every other week, and look inside their ears once a week, cleaning them with a pet-safe ear cleanser if they seem dirty. Any redness or excessive dirt in the ears is an indication that it's time to schedule a veterinary visit.<br/></p><p>Maine Coons are active without being hyper. They enjoy playing (many Maine Coons are reported to love games of fetch just like a dog). To keep your Maine Coon physically and mentally stimulated, engage him with playful toys like feather teasers or other favorite toys. Scratching is a natural behavior that is also mentally and physically enriching.  To make sure your Maine Coon scratches in the right places (not the couch), set up approved scratching areas in your house with vertical scratchers (like tall posts or cat trees) as well as horizontal scratchers that lie flat on the ground (like cardboard or sisal scratchers).<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Some purebred cats are more disposed to developing certain genetically linked health issues. Maine Coons are predisposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart), hip dysplasia, and spinal muscular atrophy (a genetic disease that causes degeneration of the spinal cord and atrophy of the muscles in the hind limbs). A genetic test is available for spinal muscular atrophy so breeders can avoid breeding affected cats or carriers. Responsible Maine Coon breeders have their adult cats screened for these and other health concerns prior to breeding them.<br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Maine Coon is a solid and rugged cat, as is fit for a working cat. Although the Maine Coon is massive, it is always well proportioned and balanced. The Maine Coon has a muscular, long, rectangular body with a broad chest. It has large, round paws with tufts of hair sticking up from the toes. The head is slightly longer in length than width, with high cheekbones, a distinctive square muzzle and large, well-tufted ears. The Maine Coon cat coat is heavy and shaggy with a ruff on the chest. The breed comes in many different colors and patterns expect for chocolate, lavender and the Himalayan (pointed) pattern. <br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with other heavily built breeds, it's important to keep Maine Coon cats from becoming overweight, something that can easily happen if the cat is free fed (food kept in the bowl at all times) rather than fed measured meals twice a day. For all cats, staying lean is healthier. For Maine Coons, which are prone to hip dysplasia, staying lean can prevent the development or worsening of joint issues. For advice about what to feed or how much to feed daily, talk to your veterinarian or breeder.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Maine Coon Cat</h2><p>The Maine Coon is one of the most popular pedigreed cat breed in the United States, and there are many excellent breeders from whom you can purchase a kitten. The Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association both publish lists of Maine Coon cat breeders on their websites. If you are rescue-minded, you might also be able to find adult Maine Coon cats or Maine Coon mixes in animal shelters and breed-specific cat rescue groups. </p><h2>Breed Overview</h2><p>The Maine Coon cat is friendly, kind, and steady in temperament, which makes them wonderful companions. Maine Coons are also quite trainable and sociable, and many have been certified as therapy cats, visiting with people in hospitals and senior care facilities. Maine Coons are affectionate and want to be close to you, but they are not overly clingy and generally aren't lap cats. Maine Coons can be entertaining to watch as they engage in silly antics, and they tend to get into everything. The Maine Coon is slow to mature, with most not reaching their full growth until about 4 years of age.</p><p>Gentle and laid-back</p><p>Affectionate and entertaining</p><p>Gets along well with kids and other pets, including dogs</p>",1267

The Teddy Roosevelt terrier is closely related to the rat terrier, but with shorter legs. Affectionately known as ""Teddies,"" the Teddy Roosevelt terrier is a small but feisty breed, with an energetic and fun-loving personality. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier (UKC)</p><p>Height: 8 to 14 inches tall (at the shoulder)</p><p>Weight: 8 to 25 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, dense, medium-hard to smooth, with a sheen</p><p>Coat Color: Any bi-color or tri-color; must always have some white</p><p>Life Span: 14 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, energetic, feisty, active, playful, lively, companionable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier</h2><p>Teddy Roosevelt terriers are friendly, outgoing, and always ready for the next adventure. They make great family dogs and are wonderful friends to respectful children who handle them gently. Thanks to their small size, Teddy Roosevelt terriers can live happily in smaller homes and apartments, as long as they get enough daily exercise. After a long day playing and exploring, Teddy Roosevelt terriers are happy to cuddle on the couch. Unlike some terriers, Teddies tend to be dog-friendly and will even get along with much larger breeds. However, the Teddy Roosevelt terrier has a high prey drive (the instinct to chase and kill small critters) so they can't be trusted around smaller pets like rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, and sometimes cats.</p><h2>History of the Teddy Roosevelt Terrier</h2><p>At one time, the rat terrier and Teddy Roosevelt terrier were considered two varieties of the rat terrier breed. The longer-legged variety (today's rat terrier) was known as the Type A rat terrier and the shorter-legged variety (today's Teddy Roosevelt terrier) was known as the Type B rat terrier. </p><p>Both terrier types were small, hardy, working terriers that served the valuable function of keeping farms and homes free from rats, mice, and other vermin. These terriers developed somewhat naturally, so there aren't available breeding records to pinpoint the exact breeds that went into their development. However, it's thought that the ancestors of today's rat terrier and Teddy Roosevelt terrier likely included the smooth fox terrier, the Manchester terrier, the bull terrier, the beagle, the whippet, the Italian greyhound, and the white English Terrier (which is now extinct).</p><p>In the 1990s, some breed fanciers sought to separate the Type A and Type B rat terriers. Their efforts led to the development of a separate breed standard for the Teddy Roosevelt terrier and a new national club: the American Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club. The club chose the name Teddy Roosevelt terrier to pay homage to President Theodore Roosevelt, who owned a small terrier named Skip, which may have been a rat terrier or rat terrier mix. President Roosevelt praised Skip for keeping the White House clear of rats and other vermin. </p><p>The Teddy Roosevelt terrier is recognized by the United Kennel Club, where it's part of the Terrier Group. It's also part of the American Kennel Club's Miscellaneous Class, which allows the breed to participate in performance sports while awaiting full recognition. </p><h2>Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Care</h2><p>Teddy Roosevelt terriers are a relatively easy breed to care for. They are full of energy but, because of their smaller size, working that energy out isn't as daunting as it would be for a larger dog. Likewise, they are moderate shedders and need a bit of grooming upkeep nothing the typical owner can't handle.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Teddy Roosevelt terriers are athletic and full of energy. They need much more exercise than you might assume considering their small size. Daily walks or hikes are nice, but you can also consider swimming, vigorous games of fetch or Frisbee, or even training for a competitive dog sport like agility or flyball. Make sure to keep your Teddy on a leash when you're out and about their instinct to chase and hunt small creatures is so strong, it can even cause them to run out into traffic. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>These terriers have short, smooth coats that shed moderately, though regular brushing can help keep that to a minimum. Bathe your Teddy Roosevelt Terrier whenever it becomes dirty and trim their nails every two weeks. Inspect their ears weekly to look for redness, debris, or odor. Clean the ears with a pet-safe ear cleaner if they become dirty and make an appointment with your veterinarian if they look inflamed, have excessive discharge, or have a foul smell. Maintain our dog's good oral hygiene by brushing its teeth at least a couple of times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Smart, curious, and eager to please, Teddy Roosevelt terriers can be taught almost anything. Keep training upbeat, fun, and positive, using treat or toy rewards and plenty of praise. They love to dig and will gladly keep your home and property free from rats, mice, gophers, moles, and other vermin if given the chance. To keep your Teddy Roosevelt terrier from digging in places you'd rather it leave alone, provide it approved digging spots in certain areas of the yard. You can even use a child's sandbox filled with sand or soil. Try secretly burying treasures like treats, chews, and toys for your Teddy Roosevelt terrier to find. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although Teddy Roosevelt terriers are generally healthy and hardy, they can be predisposed to certain genetic diseases like all purebred dogs. The American Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Club recommends that all Teddies have appropriate genetic tests performed, receive cardiac screenings for heart health, and have their knees examined and graded before being bred.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>To avoid overfeeding your Teddy Roosevelt terrier, serve measured amounts of age-appropriate dog food twice a day. Free feeding (leaving the bowl filled all the time) can lead to excess weight gain, which can put a strain on your dog's joints and back and causes other health problems, like diabetes. On the flip side, some very active Teddies may need more food to fuel their bodies. If you're not sure how much to feed talk to your veterinarian or breeder for advice.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Teddy Roosevelt Terrier</h2><p>The Teddy Roosevelt terrier is a relatively new and rare breed, so it may be hard to find a breeder who has puppies available. The American Kennel Club provides a list of member breeders on its website. Be prepared to get on a long waitlist. If you wish to adopt, some Teddy Roosevelt terriers or Teddy mixes may end up in local animal shelters or become available through private rescue groups. </p><h2>Teddy Roosevelt Terrier Overview</h2><p>Great family dog </p><p>Affectionate and engaging</p><p>Kid-friendly and dog-friendly</p><p>May dig up the yard</p><p>Needs lots of exercise</p><p>High prey drive/not safe off leash</p>",1098

It's known for a hard-working spirit and a sweet disposition as well as its massive, muscular stature. The Great Pyrenees, or Pyr, is an adorable gentle giant, very loyal to its family, and typically gets along very well with children. However, potential owners must understand their propensity for nocturnal barking and the need for socialization.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 32 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 100 to 150 pounds (males); 85 to 110 pounds (females)</p><p>COAT: Thick double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: White, but may have markings of gray, tan, badger, or reddish-brown</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Gentle, affectionate, patient, confident, strong-willed, fearless</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Great Pyrenees</h2><p>Pyr puppies are the cutest, sweetest balls of white fluff that grow up to be big dogs with equally big hearts and souls. However, they are also world-class, potentially excessive barkers with a keen sense of hearing. Because they are so loyal and loving, they will immediately alert you and the entire neighborhood to an intruder, and this is especially true at night since they were bred to be nocturnal guards. This may make them less suitable for certain households.</p><h2>History of the Great Pyrenees</h2><p>The Pyr has an ancient lineage that likely dates as far back as the 18th century BC. The breed appears to have evolved from mountain sheepdogs in Central Asia that date back many thousands of years. As evidenced by fossil remains, the Great Pyrenees (or a close ancestor) was brought to the Pyrenees mountain range of southern France sometime between 1800 to 1000 BC. The breed was developed as a guardian of sheep and the home by the Basque people of that region. During the 17th century, the Pyr was adopted by French royalty and nobles.</p><p>The Great Pyrenees was brought to the U.S. by General Lafayette in 1824. However, the breed was not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) until over 100 years later in 1933. It is known as the Pyrenean mountain dog in Europe and is still a keen worker to this day.</p><h2>Great Pyrenees Care</h2><p>Pyrs have a strong drive to work and protect and they will benefit from some type of job, such as guarding homes or training for obedience competitions. In general, these dogs are usually very calm, loyal, and loving companions.</p><p>Pyrs need to spend plenty of time with the family or they can become bored and destructive. The National Pyr Rescue recommends never leaving the dog outside in the yard when the family is not home as they may try to escape to pursue suspected predators. A physical fence is needed as their thick fur and a high pain tolerance can lead them to ignore an electronic fence.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As working dogs, Pyrs need a fair amount of exercise on a daily basis, even though they are not super high energy. Expect to walk your Pyr a minimum of 30 to 40 minutes a day, but it's adaptable and may do well with up to two hours of exercise. This breed can be walked on a leash but may tend to wander independently when off leash. They do best if they have access to a large, well-fenced yard in which to do some roaming and patrolling.</p><p>Special care should be taken to prevent exposure to very hot temperatures while exercising your Pyr, as the breed can easily overheat. They do very well exercising in cold weather, however.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Pyr has a long, thick outer coat that is primarily white and somewhat coarse, with a soft, woolly white undercoat. This breed has a moderate to high shedding rate and requires routine grooming, especially a thorough brushing once or twice per week. Their coats don't tend to mat, but brushing will help keep shed hairs out of your house.</p><p>However, given the size of the dog, you will still be seeing white Pyr hair on all of your clothes and furniture. Their coats naturally shed dirt so you will only need to bathe your dog once every couple of months. But it isn't recommended that you trim or shave the dog's coat during hot weather as it protects the dog from the sun.</p><p>Pyrs have extra dewclaws on their rear limbs, which they use for climbing. You should trim your dog's nails to keep them from splitting. Also, since this breed likes to gently paw you to get your attention, trimming can reduce the risk of scratches.</p><p>Dental care can help prevent gum disease; brush your dog's teeth at least a couple of times per week to keep its mouth healthy. Finally, look in its ears weekly for dirt, wax buildup, and other abnormalities.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Pyrs were bred to be intelligent but independent watchdogs for flocks and training can be difficult. They need consistency and are best with owners who are experienced in dog training. Socialization from a young age is important for this breed as they are naturally suspicious of any newcomer.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>This breed should be fed two meals per day of up to three cups of dry dog food per meal and a Pyr could benefit from a brand formulated for large breeds. The amount your dog needs depends on size, activity level, age, and other factors. Discuss your dog's individual nutritional needs with your veterinarian. Monitor your dog's weight to prevent overfeeding and obesity.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Great Pyrenees</h2><p>The Great Pyrenees Club of America's breeder referral list is a great place to start your search for a puppy. Expect to pay anywhere from between $1,000 to $4,000 depending on the breeder and the dog's lineage.</p><p>However, if you are looking for a rescue you will find many local organizations devoted to saving and re-homing Pyrs by searching online. Among the national groups are the National Pyr Rescue and Great Pyrenees Rescue Society.</p><h2>Great Pyrenees Overview</h2><p>Calm and affectionate</p><p>Loyal and protective</p><p>Gets along well with children and most other pets</p><p>High shedding rate and needs frequent grooming</p><p>Training can be challenging</p><p>High affinity for warning barking, especially at night</p>",1038

This brave, hardy, and determined dog is known for being a loyal companion with an adventurous personality.</p><p>Known for being the first native breed to receive recognition in Australia, Australian Terriers are the smallest of the working terrier breeds. These dogs may be small, but they're also spunky and filled with character. Filled with energy, they can also be mischievous. If you're looking for a new best friend that also keeps you entertained, the Australian Terrier might be the perfect addition to your family.<br/></p><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 10 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 20 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, wiry, waterproof double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Blue and tan, red, or sandy</p><p>Life Span: 11 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Spirited, companionable, alert, courageous, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Australia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Australian Terrier</h2><p>Australian Terriers can adapt equally well to apartment living and farm life or other rural environments. They tend to make great family pets thanks to their playful and lively personalities, and they often enjoy the company of respectful children. These terriers thrive with plenty of company, so they shouldn't be left alone for too long.</p><p>This breed does well when it's the only dog in the house, but it can also get along great with other dogs and even cats when introduced carefully. Since the Australian Terrier loves to be the center of its owner's attention, it's still likely to become bossy or show guarding traits toward other animals. These dogs aren't suited for every type of family, but for the right person who's dedicated to their care, they can become extremely loyal and affectionate.<br/></p><h2>History of the Australian Terrier</h2><p>The Australian Terrier was originally known as the Rough Coated Terrier, but its name was officially changed in 1897. The breed shares ancestry with several similar dogs, including the Cairn Terrier, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier, and the Yorkshire Terrier. Because some Australian Terriers have black and tan coats, they're often confused with Yorkies.</p><p>These dogs were developed in Australia in the early 19th century after working terriers were brought over by European settlers. These little dogs needed to be able to withstand a variety of weather conditions and terrains. They were primarily bred to be ratters, which these spunky, courageous little canines excelled at. Australian Terriers also developed strong bonds with their owners and became popular companion dogs.</p><p>While visiting British nobility, American servicemen and other travelers started to export this charming little breed back to the United States in the mid-1900s. In 1977, the Australian Terrier was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club.</p><h2>Australian Terrier Care</h2><p>When it comes to exercising, the Australian Terrier's small size can be deceiving. This breed isn't suited for life as a lap dog, but rather for staying active and performing a job. Intelligent and eager to learn, these dogs also excel at most training techniques, though they can have a stubborn streak at first. When it comes to grooming, your Australian Terrier will do best with routine care and haircuts when needed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Australian Terrier's working roots mean that this breed likes to be kept busy. These dogs need about 30 to 45 minutes per day of exercise and mental stimulation to prevent problem behaviors from developing as a result of boredom. They're also expert diggers thanks to their ratting skills, which means that they're likely to find entertainment in garden beds despite their owners' desires. Thankfully, options like sandpits are a great way to let this breed follow its instincts in a designated area while staying active.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Australian Terrier has a low-maintenance grooming regime. Some owners will have their dog's coat hand-stripped, but simply trimming the hair around the eyes is sufficient. Brush this breed at least once per week to keep its fur healthy and tangle-free.</p><p>Australian Terriers will also need to have their nails trimmed, ears cleaned, and teeth brushed on a regular basis. Like other small breeds, these dogs are prone to dental infections, so it's important for owners to keep up with these needs. Daily teeth brushing is ideal, but even quick weekly brushings will help keep problems at bay.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This smart breed responds well to positive reinforcement training methods, and it's often spotted participating in a variety of competitive dog sports. Activities like agility training are a great way to work your dog's mind and body at the same time while strengthening your relationship.</p><p>Since Australian Terriers can be stubborn and easily distracted, it's best to keep training sessions short and frequent to prevent boredom. Reward your dog with treats, affection, and playtime for desirable behaviors during training.</p><p>This terrier's hunting instincts can lead it to chase small pets or become aggressive with animals it's unfamiliar with. This also means that a reliable recall may require extra time and work. Care should be taken with introductions to cats, and socialization with dogs should be early and ongoing to prevent dog aggression.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Australian Terrier is known for being robust and healthy, but it's still possible for inherited health conditions to develop.

This breed turns heads with its regal and stunning body, which has an air of authority afforded by its large size. While considered a large breed canine, it should be noted the supersized schnauzer doesn't belong to the group of giant breeds (including the Newfoundland, Great Dane, mastiff, and more). Instead, these dogs are considered giant only when compared to the smaller varieties of schnauzer.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 27 1/2 inches (males); 23 to 25 inches (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 60 to 95 pounds (males); 55 to 75 pounds (females)</p><p>COAT: Short double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid black or salt-and-pepper</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Powerful, intelligent, strong-willed, kind, loyal, dominant</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Giant Schnauzer</h2><p>The giant schnauzer's personality is best described as confident, but the breed can border on aloof if improperly socialized. But when well-trained and well-socialized, it's a loyal family dog and active companion. These are powerful dogs with a big heart for their family. The giant schnauzer is a bold and beautiful breed, but it may not be for everyone, particularly novice dog owners who are not aware of this dog's need for strong and consistent obedience training.</p><h2>History of the Giant Schnauzer</h2><p>The history of the giant schnauzer begins with the development of the standard schnauzer. Originally developed in Germany in the 1800s, the schnauzer was named for the German word for muzzle, which is ""schnauze."" The first breed type was a standard-sized canine that excelled in general farm work, like guarding livestock and hunting small rodents.</p><p>However, in the late 1800s, a need for a larger and more powerful working dog was identified. The standard schnauzer exhibited many desirable qualities and was a popular dog in Germany. To add size and stamina to the breed, schnauzers were crossed with large breed dogs like the Great Dane. The result was a considerably bigger and more powerful canine, known today as the giant schnauzer.</p><p>The giant schnauzer became a common sight on farms in the Bavarian Alps, since this breed was capable of guarding and herding livestock. The increased size gave these dogs a considerable advantage against large predators and a more commanding ability to herd cattle and other livestock. Later, these attributes led to this breed's use for police and military organizations throughout Europe.</p><p>In the late 1920s and early 1930s, giant schnauzers began to be imported to the United States, where enthusiasts worked to develop the breed standard and earn club recognition. The current breed standard was approved by the AKC in 1983 and is in relative harmony with European breed standards, though it should be noted that there are some subtle differences.</p><p>In addition to a solid work repertoire, schnauzers have a long history of capturing attention in the show ring particularly in the U.S., where the breed is primarily bred for show and companionship. In Europe, the breed is largely still bred for working roles. </p><h2>Giant Schnauzer Care</h2><p>The giant schnauzer was bred to work, so it should come as no surprise that this dog needs a job to do and plenty of training to keep its guarding instincts from becoming a liability.

However, the giant schnauzer is a loyal family dog and shouldn't be kept outdoors for extended periods.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>With a wiry double coat, a schnauzer needs ongoing grooming. Plan to brush your dog weekly and bathe it as needed. In addition, a regular visit to a grooming service will be necessary to clip or strip the coat and maintain those bushy eyebrows and characteristic snout 'stache. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>These dogs are intelligent and alert which can be seen from their aptitude for police work. They are well-suited for obedience training and excel at this and other canine competitions, including agility and field trials.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Careful breeding has helped to ensure the integrity of the breed and minimize health problems of the giant schnauzer, but like all purebred dogs, there are some health conditions to be aware of. The National Breed Club recommends that you buy from a breeder that can provide ophthalmologist, thyroid, and hip evaluations.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>An active breed, the giant schnauzer will benefit from two well-balanced meals a day. Balance your dog's energy output with caloric intake for a healthy dog. Treats may be a useful aid in training, but keep them in moderation to prevent weight gain.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Giant Schnauzer</h2><p>A big breed like the giant schnauzer requires a big commitment as does adopting any dog. Make sure you do your research to identify whether this dog fits your lifestyle. Talk with breeders and read up on the breed's history and use. If you have the time and energy to train and maintain a giant schnauzer, they'll repay you with a giant amount of love!</p><p>Finding a giant schnauzer is easier compared to some other purebred dogs.

While not recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC), these dogs retain many personality traits from their mixed origins. As the name implies, King Shepherds are giant hybrid dogs that come from the cross-breeding of German Shepherds and Shiloh Shepherds. However, the King Shepherd's massive size makes it stand out among its close relatives.</p><p>Despite their large stature and somewhat imposing appearance, King Shepherds are usually very friendly. These dogs are usually very calm and sweet with their owners. King Shepherds are also loyal and protective of their family members but not aggressive making them the perfect pet for the right owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized</p><p>Height: 27 to 31 inches (males); 25 to 27 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 90 to 150 pounds (males); 75 to 110 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Long, course, and either straight or wavy</p><p>Coat Color: Black, white, tan, brown, gray, or silver</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 11 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, calm, friendly, loyal, protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the King Shepherd</h2><p>King Shepherds have very calm, adaptable personalities. They're best suited for single-family homes with fenced-in outdoor spaces due to their large size and high exercise needs. These dogs are a great choice for owners with kids, as they're typically very gentle with children and other pets. King Shepherds can serve as efficient working dogs or be content as companions, and their level of intelligence makes them easily trainable. However, this breed also bonds closely with its owners, and it can become destructive in the house when left alone too often.</p><h2>History of the King Shepherd</h2><p>The term ""designer breed"" may include dogs like Labradoodles and Yorkipoos, but it also refers to the giant, rugged-looking King Shepherd. Originating in the United States in the 1990s, these dogs were originally bred to create a German Shepherd mix that had fewer health issues than a purebred German Shepherd.</p><p>American breeders David Turkheimer and Shelley Watts-Cross first bred a German Shepherd with a Shiloh Shepherd (a hybrid of German Shepherds and Alaskan Malamutes) to elevate the best qualities of the German Shepherd. In order to achieve the long-haired look they wanted, the breeders also incorporated long-haired German Shepherds from European lineages. These European lines didn't just give King Shepherds their distinctive coats, but they also boosted genetic variation. This was essential to reduce the risk of genetic issues that have become common in longstanding lineages because of inbreeding.</p><p>Because King Shepherds are a relatively new breed and still fairly rare among American families they are not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club. They are, however, recognized by the American Rare Breed Association (ARBA), World Wide Kennel Club (WWKC), and Eastern Rare Breed Dog Club (ERBDC), among additional smaller organizations.</p><h2>King Shepherd Care</h2><p>If you're looking for a low-maintenance dog, the King Shepherd may not be the right pet for you. Between their grooming and exercise requirements, King Shepherds need lots of time, energy, and attention in order to thrive.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>King Shepherds are a high-energy breed that needs extensive exercise. Strenuous activity for at least one hour per day is a must. These dogs thrive in active, single-family homes with lots of space to run, walk, explore, and play.</p><p>Because they're also very intelligent, King Shepherds benefit from exercise routines that incorporate mental stimulation. Playing games like fetch, tug-of-war, or hide and seek are great ways for owners to keep this breed entertained. These dogs also excel in canine sports like agility training. King Shepherds can become bored very easily, so it's vital to keep them engaged and exercised to prevent them from becoming destructive.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>King Shepherds have thick, double coats that shed heavily. Brushing your dog several times per week (or even daily) can help reduce shedding and keep their coat healthy, clean, and tangle-free.</p><p>When it comes to baths, the King Shepherd only requires standard bathing every three to four months. Check your dog's ears and clean its teeth regularly to prevent infections. If your King Shepherd is especially active, running and walking can help keep their nails worn down, but trimmings should be performed as necessary.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>King Shepherds are highly intelligent dogs, making training relatively simple for owners that are consistent and engaging. Basic obedience lessons can start in puppyhood between eight and 16 weeks of age, while more involved training should continue through the dog's life. Because King Shepherds are so eager to please their family members, they can learn simple commands fairly quickly. Begin socializing your dog when you first bring it home to ensure it stays friendly and well-mannered with strangers and other animals.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While King Shepherds are generally healthy dogs, they're still prone to certain health issues like most breeds. Responsible breeders will test parent dogs for inherited diseases to prevent passing problems on to puppies; however, this breed's genetic variation does offer additional protection against genetic disorders.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your King Shepherd a high-quality diet with plenty of protein. This breed typically eats between three and four cups of dry food per day, and it's important to split these portions into several smaller meals to help prevent Bloat.</p><p>Since King Shepherds are also prone to joint problems, owners should be especially mindful of their dog's weight. Canine obesity or excessive weight gain can put added stress on your dog's joints. To create a meal plan with the proper nutrients and portions, talk to your veterinarian about the best diet based on your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a King Shepherd</h2><p>Before adding a King Shepherd to your family, ensure that your home, schedule, and lifestyle can accommodate this large, energetic breed. These dogs require considerable grooming and daily strenuous exercise.</p><p>Since King Shepherds are still a new dog breed, they're not as likely to be found in shelters as their German Shepherd cousins. Visit your local shelter to meet similar dogs in need of forever homes.</p><p>If you plan to purchase a King Shepherd puppy, it's essential to research responsible breeders that readily provide the litter's family medical history. Your breeder should also allow you to meet the litter's parents and see the conditions in which their dogs are kept. These puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $2,500, but prices may vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>King Shepherd Overview</h2><p>Sweet, gentle, and good-natured with children and other pets</p><p>Loyal to its family, but not aggressive</p><p>Intelligent and easy to train</p><p>Requires daily grooming to prevent excessive shedding</p><p>Very high exercise needs; may become destructive when bored</p><p>Not suitable for apartments or homes without outdoor space</p>",1093

Despite its name, the dog breed originated in America's Midwest, where it's long served as a farm dog. These talkative dogs come in three sizes but are always white with perky ears. Playful and a bit mischievous, American Eskimo dogs keep their owners on their toes with high-energy antics. This breed is a perfect balance of brains and beauty for the right owner.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting Group</p><p>HEIGHT: 9 to 12 inches (toy variety); 12 to 15 inches (miniature variety); 15 to 19 inches (standard variety)</p><p>WEIGHT: 6 to 10 pounds (toy); 10 to 20 pounds (miniature); 25 to 35 pounds (standard)</p><p>COAT: Thick, glossy double-coat with thick ruff around neck and chest</p><p>COAT COLOR: Pure white, sometimes slightly cream-colored</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, alert, friendly, reserved, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the American Eskimo Dog</h2><p>This alert breed can range from friendly and easygoing to overly alert and reserved with strangers. While many American Eskimo dogs can be excellent family dogs, others struggle with the bustle of family life.</p><h2>History of the American Eskimo Dog</h2><p>The American Eskimo Dog, or Eskie, is a breed created by German immigrants in the upper Midwestern United States not by Eskimos. German farm owners in Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Ohio brought German spitz dogs with them, considered an all-around farm dog.</p><p>Like most spitz breeds, the German spitz had a curly tail, a thick coat, and pointed ears. The breed was refined into its flashy all-white version over time, and its charming looks and quick wit quickly earned it a place with circuses and vaudeville acts. One of the most famous dogs of all time was an American Eskimo dog by the name of Pierre, a tightrope walker from the Barnum & Bailey Circus.</p><p>The German spitz breed's name was changed after World War I, thanks to anti-German sentiment. The name ""American Eskimo"" was chosen to honor an Ohio breeding kennel of the same name. Although the breed has a long history of being an all-purpose farm dog in the Midwest for decades, it was only recognized by the AKC in 1995.</p><p>American Eskimo dogs still make excellent training partners for trick dogs, obedience, agility, and more, but they're generally kept as pets rather than working farm dogs.</p><h2>American Eskimo Dog Care</h2><p>Eskies are commonly described as ""busy"" dogs that need quite a bit more exercise and mental enrichment than some other small, white, fluffy breeds, like shih tzus and bichon frises. Unlike those breeds, Eskies were working dogs just a few decades ago. Give your dog an hour of activity per day plus three different training activities per week. Food-dispensing toys and trick training are both fun ways to help work your dog's mind.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>A walk or even a game of fetch won't cut it for these dogs they need mental challenges as well as physical exertion. Without proper exercise and enrichment, this breed quickly becomes destructive and vocal. Tools like bark collars may silence your dog but are likely to cause redirected frustration in the form of digging, chewing, or other distress behaviors. Frequent hikes, activity walks, and dog sports can help keep your American Eskimo dog content.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming American Eskimo dogs requires constant vigilance this small, hairy breed can get out of control quickly. Brushing these dogs several times per week will keep the hair in check and help reduce shedding. Take special care to work out mats around the harness, collar, ears, and rump areas. Long-haired double-coated dogs generally need a variety of grooming tools, including rakes, bristle brushes, rotating-tooth combs, and wire pin brushes. Don't shave Eskies, even in the summer this can damage their double coat and reduce their ability to deal with heat or cold.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>American Eskimo dogs are inherently stubborn so training is necessary or you'll have an obstinate pup on your hands. Puppies will need socialization training and older adopted Eskies may need obedience training. Keep training fun and lighthearted with an Eskie, and don't expect perfection with this breed. If a session is getting frustrating, try to make it easier or cut it short for the day.</p><p> </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The American Eskimo dog is a relatively healthy dog breed, probably due to its recent history as a working dog. This breed is vulnerable to conditions such as: </p><p>While there's a significant genetic component to diabetes, it's also important to feed your dog regular meals of high-quality food. Free-feeding (providing food at all times) and high-fat diets can contribute to diabetes even if your dog isn't overweight.</p><p>Some of these problems are best avoided by finding a good breeder and ensuring that they do appropriate health testing. Keep in mind that good health testing is much more extensive than just a veterinary checkup the parent dogs generally need genetic testing and/or medical imaging to rule out genetic issues. Once your dog is in your home, you can ensure it lives a long and healthy life with sufficient exercise and high-quality food.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Despite being naturally athletic, the American Eskimo dog gains weight rather easily. This might be due to genetic factors or because their thick fur makes it hard to tell if they're putting on the pounds. Using your hands to rub your dog along the ribs can help you feel for its true size. You should be able to feel the definition in your dog's hips and a few ribs quite easily, though they shouldn't protrude, either.</p><p>Puzzle feeders help slow your dog down and burn off energy, and can help your dog enjoy its high-quality dog food. Avoid high-fat food with this breed, as this might increase their already elevated risk for diabetes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American Eskimo Dog</h2><p>Finding this purebred dog in a shelter or rescue may be difficult, but not impossible, so you may need to turn to a breeder. The American Eskimo Dog Club of America is a great place to start your search for a breeder or a rescue organization with leads on adoptable Eskies.

DNA analysis shows the Shih Tzu, like the Lhasa apso, is a more direct branch from the wolf than many other dog breeds.</p><p>The exact origins of the Shih Tzu as a Chinese royal house pet are hazy, with different dates offered over the past 1,100 years. The breed became known as a noble dog of China, primarily as a royal house pet to members of the Ming Dynasty from the 14th to 17th century.

Their mischievous nature demands an owner who is willing to keep up with them both physically and mentally. They love company from both humans and animals alike and would do well in a household with other animals.</p><h2>History of the Siberian Husky</h2><p>The Siberian husky originated in Northeast Asia, where the Chukchi people developed the breed specifically for use as a sled dog. Genetically, they are part of the Spitz family. During the early 20th century, Alaskans grew interested in the breed and the Siberian husky was brought to the United States.</p><p>Over the years, huskies have excelled as sled dogs. Perhaps most notable was the transport of antitoxins to Nome, Alaska during an epidemic of diphtheria. Commemoration of this lifesaving journey has led to the yearly Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. A statue of the lead dog who completed the serum run, Balto, was erected in Central Park in New York City in 1925.</p><p>The Siberian husky was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930. They have continued to work diligently as sled dogs but are now more commonly known as companion dogs. They are the 12th most popular breed in the U.S., according to the AKC. </p><h2>Siberian Husky Care</h2><p>Siberian huskies were bred as pack teams and they generally get along well with other dogs. That can make them suitable for trips to a securely-fenced free-run dog park. They have a strong prey drive and that can prove to be a problem if you have pet rodents, rabbits, or even cats. However, if raised together with a cat, they may coexist well.</p><p>This breed is loving with children and is usually a happy playmate and tolerant of their mischief. But children must treat any dog with respect and not treat the dog roughly. Most Siberian huskies are also friendly with visitors and are not good watchdogs.</p></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p><br/>Huskies can benefit from activities like running as long as it's not too warm outside. You may need to find creative ways to exercise your husky indoors when it's hot outside, as this breed is only moderately heat-tolerant. Huskies like to dig and you can expect plenty of holes in your yard. A bored husky indoors or outdoors can be very destructive.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Siberian husky's dense, double hair coat makes the breed able to withstand very low temperatures (though this breed is not so comfortable in hot climates). The Siberian husky's undercoat is soft while the top coat is thicker and slightly coarse.</p><p>This dog breed will have minimal shedding for much of the year and then shed quite a lot over the period of about three weeks, known as blowing the coat. It will be a chore to keep up with the shedding during that time and your yard (and home) will likely be full of tufts of husky fur.</p><p>Thoroughly brush out your husky once or twice a week. The Furminator is a great tool to use during times of heavy shedding. They are known as fastidious dogs who keep themselves clean and have little doggy odor; you will only rarely need to bathe a Siberian husky. Trim their nails regularly, keeping them short to avoid splitting and discomfort. Brush your dog's teeth a couple of times a week to maintain good oral health.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Huskies are energetic and smart dogs that can be vocal (often in the form of howling or whining). They require a lot of training and exercise to keep them happy and healthy. Many Huskies have a desire to explore and can be escape artists, so they can't be walked off-leash as they will be off exploring and chasing small animals. They also need a sturdy physical fence that is high enough that they can't bound over it and is protected so they can't dig under it. Serious training is absolutely essential to help your Husky focus its energy. Without enough training and exercise, a Husky may seem out of control at times.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in Huskies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Siberian Huskies were bred to require less food than some similarly sized breeds. Provide your dog with two meals per day, each of which should be up to a cup of dry dog food. Your dog's specific dietary needs will depend on size, activity level, age, and other factors. Be sure to monitor your dog's weight to prevent obesity and discuss your dog's nutritional needs with your veterinarian.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Siberian Husky</h2><p>Siberian Huskies are in-demand dogs, so it's unlikely one will show up at the local animal shelter though it's always worth checking. Keep an eye on local rescue groups, too.</p><p>If you're interested in finding a reputable Siberian Husky breeder, visit the Siberian Husky Club of America's website, which has a referral directory of breeders that may have dogs available.</p><h2>Siberian Husky Overview</h2><p>Friendly and gentle with all ages and most animals</p><p>A low predisposition to hereditary diseases</p><p>Intelligent and easy to train</p><p>Heavy shedding, particularly during a twice-a-year shed</p><p>Prone to vocalization, including particularly loud howling</p><p>Requires a significant amount of exercise</p>",1038

This immense dog is big-boned and muscular with a noble, kind, and loyal disposition. Mastiffs are very gentle companions and family protectors that lack aggression, making them lovely family pets. These courageous yet well-mannered dogs can do well in most households.</p><p>You don't need a huge home to have this giant dog, but you do need a little extra space (especially because of the long tail). Sadly, like other giant dog breeds, the lifespan of the Mastiff tends to be shorter than the average dog. However, with proper care, you can help your Mastiff live a full, healthy life.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 27.5 inches and up</p><p>WEIGHT: 120 to 220 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short and sleek.</p><p>COAT COLOR: Fawn, apricot, or brindle, all with a dark mask on the muzzle, ears, and nose.</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Calm, affectionate, protective, loyal, peaceful, sweet-tempered</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Mastiff</h2><p>In spite of their overwhelmingly large appearance, Mastiff's are big softies at heart. Affectionately known as gentle giants, the massive breed has gained a reputation for their kind souls, calm demeanor, and family-friendly nature. They need a decent amount of care due to their size, but will reward their owners with a lifetime of affection and companionship.</p><h2>History of the Mastiff</h2><p>The Mastiff hails from England, where it has been bred for over 2000 years. However, the Mastiff (or its ancestors) can be traced back to ancient times, with depictions on Egyptian monuments and mentions by Caesar when he invaded Britain.</p><p>Though historically seen as a worker and watchdog, at one point in time this magnificent breed was used for fighting, including in gladiatorial fights between humans and other animals. Later, they were featured in dogfights watched in Westminster in London. Today's Mastiff is a lover, not a fighter, and the U.K. prohibited dogfights in 1835. The current lineages of Mastiffs stem from the 19th century when they were no longer bred for aggressiveness.</p><p>Mastiffs have might have been brought to the United States over 200 years ago, but they were not officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) until the late 1800s. The breed is referred to as the old English mastiff, the English mastiff, or simply the mastiff.</p><p>The last-recorded heaviest dog in the world was an English mastiff named Aicama Zorba of La Susa, weighing 343 pounds and standing 37 inches at the shoulder, as recorded in the 1989 ""Guinness Book of Records."" This record will remain standing as the organization discontinued recognizing record sizes for pets in 2000.</p><h2>Mastiff Care</h2><p>Mastiffs will need regular care and grooming to remain looking and feeling their best. Though they're not considered particularly intelligent or trainable, some light obedience training is always a good idea in order to ensure they remain safe and good companions.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>In general, Mastiffs are quite docile (but not listless). Younger dogs are more playful, but an endearing quality of aloof laziness often develops as they mature. Routine exercise will help keep your Mastiff fit and motivated.</p><p>As a large breed, mastiffs do better in cool weather than in hot weather. Exercise your Mastiff during the cool part of the day in summer. They do very well indoors, even in an apartment, or a house with a fenced yard. However, you might want to think ahead if your living space requires climbing stairs, as this may be difficult for an aging dog.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Mastiff has a short coat that typically needs little more than routine grooming (regular brushing, bathing, and nail trimming). This breed is a moderately high shedder. Additionally, the mastiff's ears and facial skin folds (if present) should be kept clean and dry. Mastiffs are known to salivate quite a bit, and they might share their drool when they shake their heads, so keep drool rags handy.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like all dogs, proper training and socialization are both important for the Mastiff. This is especially crucial because of the giant size of this breed. Careful attention should be given to the prevention of jumping and leash-pulling. You should socialize a Mastiff well so its natural protectiveness is appropriate and it does not become overprotective around visitors. </p><p>Consider dog-proofing your home for a mastiff. Its strong tail can sweep items off of tables and the dog may be tall enough to sample your dinner from the dining room table. Mastiffs like to chew on things, so you should provide plenty of durable chew toys in an attempt to save your furniture.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in Mastiffs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed a Mastiff puppy food that is specific to large breeds to help them grow steadily and not too fast. This can help reduce the risk of adult-onset hip dysplasia. Puppies will still attain their full size even if they are trim during the puppy years.</p><p>Adult Mastiff dogs need six to eight cups of dry food each day, which you should split into two meals to help prevent bloating and stomach torsion. You might explore feeders that enforce slower eating. Mastiffs are sloppy drinkers and they have a lot of backwash into their water bowls it's best to provide clean, fresh water at different points of the day. They are also prone to passing gas.</p><p>Be sure to monitor your mastiff for weight gain and discuss this with your veterinarian to get recommendations on how to address it with diet and exercise.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mastiff</h2><p>Pet owners looking for a Mastiff can seek out a specialized breeder or look into local adoption agencies. If you're looking for a Mastiff breeder, it's normal to be put on a waiting list, but there are generally puppies available throughout the year. Be sure to seek out a reputable breeder with a history of healthy litters and detailed care they should be able to answer any questions you have regarding the pedigree, health, and history of the litter and its parents. Ideally, you should meet one or both parents to have a better idea of your future pet's personality, size, and temperament.</p><h2>Mastiff Overview</h2><p>Gentle and loyal</p><p>Protective</p><p>Become endearingly lazy as they age</p><p>Drool quite a bit</p><p>Large tails can cause damage and require extra space in your home</p><p>Heavy chewers</p><p>Extensive food requirements</p>",1049

These dogs are often recognized by their solid black or black-and-tan coats, but Hovawarts with blonde fur also closely resemble the Golden Retriever. This beloved German breed has long served as a watchdog and guardian, and it was even named for these talents. ""Hovawart"" springs from the German words Hof (meaning yard or farm) and Wächter (meaning watchman).</p><p>These dogs are extremely intelligent, free-thinking, loyal companions for anyone up to the challenge of fulfilling their high exercise and training needs. They are used in search and rescue, obedience trials, and therapy dog activities. Though not recommended for first-time dog owners, this breed makes a wonderful companion ready to work alongside owners with the time and dedication it requires to thrive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working </p><p>Height: 25 to 28 inches (males); 23 to 26 inches (females) </p><p>Weight: 55 to 110 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long, thick coat</p><p>Coat Color: Blonde, black, or black and tan</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, courageous, watchful, attentive, even-tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Hovawart</h2><p>The Hovawart is even-tempered and aware of its surroundings. Like other guardian breeds, Hovawarts are protective of their families and can be reserved around strangers, but early socialization can help these dogs embrace new people. They have especially loving personalities toward children and can get along well with other pets when introduced at a young age, though adult Hovawarts may try to dominate dogs they aren't familiar with.</p><p>It's important for prospective owners to understand this breed's energy level, as Hovawarts require plenty of exercise along with consistent training due to their above-average intelligence (which can lead to boredom when not mentally stimulated). Overall, for the right owner, this breed can make a devoted and loyal companion.</p><h2>History of the Hovawart</h2><p>The Hovawart is a rare dog breed that originated in Germany. Because of their similar look, Hovawarts are often confused with Golden Retrievers or shepherd mixes. These dogs were first bred as mixes with working dogs like German Shepherds, Newfoundlands, and Leonbergers, but like many older dog breeds, their population became depleted over time. According to the AKC, the breeding of these intelligent canines was restored in 1922 by introducing similar farm dogs into the bloodline.</p><p>The FCI recognized the Hovawart in 1937. After World War II, the Hovawart population began thinning out once again. Thanks to determined breeders and the Hovawart joining the German Kennel Club (VDH) in 1948, these dogs became more popular. Since 2010, this breed has been a part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service. </p><h2>Hovawart Care</h2><p>The Hovawart can be a great companion when cared for properly. These dogs need considerable exercise to stay healthy, and it's also important to keep them mentally stimulated and provide consistent training. Although they have a thick coat, Hovawarts only require basic grooming aside from extra brushings during their shedding season.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These farm guardians require plenty of physical and mental exercise, needing as much as two hours of activity per day. Hovawarts love a large array of outdoor activities such as hiking, swimming, tracking, and more, so they're a great breed choice for active owners that want to bring their dog along for new adventures.</p><p>Thanks to their intelligence, Hovawarts also excel at canine sports like agility training. Since they are a large breed with such vigorous exercise requirements, Hovawarts should not be raised as apartment dogs or urban dogs that can't spend much time outside.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Hovawart boasts beautiful long hair but does not have a thick undercoat. This makes occasional brushing sufficient to keep them clean. However, seasonal shedding will require more brushing and baths. This breed has strong, fast-growing nails, so plan for consistent trimmings. Check your dog's ears for dirt or buildup (cleaning them with a dog-safe solution and a cotton ball) and brush its teeth regularly to prevent dental infections.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training is very important for this breed, as its intelligent, free-thinking nature means it will take in a situation and form its own opinion on how to respond. However, this may not match up with your expectations. Patient guidance and proper exposure are key.</p><p>Though intelligent, the breed is slow to develop and may be around two years of age before reaching maturity. Hovawarts can also have a stubborn streak. While these dogs may be difficult to train at first, it's essential not to use harsh or disciplinary training methods. This form of training can backfire and cause more behavioral problems. Instead, like most dog breeds, the Hovawart responds best to positive reinforcement. These smart canines want to work with you not for you so try to work as a team.</p><p>The Hovawart is an extremely loyal, caring family dog if properly socialized from an early age. They can have a dominant nature with other dogs, but generally get along with other pets and strangers when exposed regularly as they grow and learn.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Hovawart is generally a very healthy dog breed. However, it is still susceptible to health problems that many other breeds experience. Thankfully, most Hovawarts do not experience these problems according to the national breed club.</p><p>Responsible breeding is essential to keep the Hovawart breed healthy over future generations. Breeders can test parent dogs for health problems and perform selective breeding to avoid passing problems down to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed this breed two times per day. Avoid overfeeding, which can lead to canine obesity and cause health problems down the road. Choosing high-quality dog food will help your Hovawart live a long, healthy life.</p><p>Your dog will have varying nutritional needs that can be met with different foods appropriate to their activity level and stage of life. Talk with your veterinarian to determine the best type of food and portion plan for your specific dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Hovawart</h2><p>Hovawarts are extremely intelligent, independent canines that form strong bonds with their families. Their intense mental and physical exercise needs may not make them the right choice for every home. Before adopting any dog, carefully research the breed and talk with breeders to understand more about its care.<br/></p><p>The Hovawart is a rare breed, making this dog a bit difficult to find in most rescues. Visit your local shelter to find similar dogs in need of forever homes.</p><p>If you love this breed but can't find a Hovawart in a shelter or rescue, it's essential to purchase your puppy from a reputable breeder. Puppies typically cost between $1,000 and $3,500, but prices can vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Hovawart Overview</h2><p>Bonds closely with its family</p><p>Protective of its pack</p><p>Typically lives a long, healthy, active life</p><p>Can be stubborn </p><p>Matures slowly, requiring diligent, patient training </p><p>Has high exercise needs; not suitable for apartments</p>",1113

Perhaps the most notable characteristic of the Siamese cat, though, is its ""points,"" which are darker color patterns on the ears, face (mask), tail, legs, and feet. Siamese cats, fondly known as ""meezers,"" are popular among people who want a sociable cat that loves to ""talk."" Officially recognized by the Cat Fancier's Association in 1906, the Siamese is one of the original breeds of pedigreed cats.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Meezer</p><p>Personality: Sociable, friendly, vocal</p><p>Weight: Up to 14 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 24 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Seal, chocolate, blue, and lilac</p><p>Coat Patterns: Colorpoint</p><p>Eye Color: Blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 12 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Thailand</p><h2>Siamese Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Siamese cats are anything but reserved around humans. They bond to humans much like dogs do and will follow their owners around the house, seeking attention. With highly social personalities. Siamese cats want constant interaction and will get depressed if you leave them alone for long. As such, they are best in a household where their owners are home more of the day or there are other pets for company.</p><p>Siamese cats are notoriously vocal with loud, deep voices. They love to ""chat"" as if they share a common language with humans, and they will also chide their owners if they feel they are being ignored. Although they demand attention, Siamese cats have even-keeled temperaments, so they blend well into families with children and other pets.</p><h2>History of the Siamese Cat</h2><p>Siamese cats come from Thailand. In 1880, the king of Siam gave two pairs of Siamese cats to the English consul-general in Bangkok who brought them home to London where they became the talk of the town. Their popularity escalated as people sought to own one of these beautiful ""Oriental"" cats. The first Siamese to win a champion title was Wankee in 1898, and the breed developed rapidly thereafter.</p><p>Whether Siamese breeders followed the judges in official Siamese show rings or vice-versa, is not clear, but the Siamese cat gradually attained a slimmer look with a more wedge-shaped head. This modern breed of Siamese more closely resembles depictions of the original Egyptian cats.</p><p>In 1987, a group of Siamese breeders, distressed with the extreme changes in the appearance of the modern breed and concerned with potential health problems, banded together to form the Traditional and Classic Cat International registry. One of the goals of the organization was to ""bring back and maintain the 'Old Style' look of each breed.""</p><p>People are often confused about the terms ""traditional"" and ""classic"" as it refers to Siamese cats. The founder of The Traditional Siamese Cat Association, Sheelagh Le Cocq, explains that the classic Siamese is sort of a cross between the traditional and modern versions without the extremes of either. She describes the classical stage of Siamese breeding as occurring between 1945 and 1970.</p><p>Famous depictions of Siamese cats in popular modern culture can be found in the Disney animated movie, , which featured two Siamese cats (Si and Am). A Siamese was also the title star of the television series,</p><h2>Siamese Cat Care</h2><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Siamese like to climb and should have a cat tree or other structure to give them this outlet. They also like puzzle toys and teaser toys to chase. You do not want this cat to get bored when you are away from home, or you may return to find it has been up to some curtain-climbing or other mischief for entertainment.</p><p>Siamese cats are active, intelligent, and curious, which makes them relatively trainable cats. One of the easiest ways to train cats is with a clicker. Siamese cats can be clicker-trained to fetch toys as well as other fun tricks.</p><h3>Shedding</h3><p>The Siamese cat has a short coat that needs only standard care. Give your cat a good brushing weekly to remove loose hair and reduce the risk of hairballs.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Your indoor cat's claws may need regular trimming every 10 to 14 days, and you can also provide a scratching post to save your upholstery and woodwork.</p><p>Pay attention to dental hygiene as well. Starting your cat with regular tooth brushing at an early age will make the procedure easier and help your cat's teeth stay healthy.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The most prevalent health concern for Siamese cats is an eye condition. Cross-eyed Siamese were common decades ago; the same gene that gave them colored points also resulted in faulty vision wiring in the brain. The tendency for crossed eyes was mostly bred out, but it still means that Siamese have less-acute vision than other cats, so they are more vulnerable to being hit by vehicles when outside after dark.</p><p>You should provide all of the usual domestic cat immunizations, preventative veterinary treatments, and check-ups.</p><p>Cats live longer if they are indoor-only cats. This prevents exposure to infections from other animals and the environment as well as injuries from fights and accidents. A securely-fenced yard might keep out predators, but a Siamese is likely to scale any fence and escape.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Siamese is a medium-sized cat that reaches its full size within about a year. Its build is lithe and muscular, and its eyes are strikingly blue.</p><p>The Siamese's short, soft coat can range in color from seal or chocolate to blue or lilac, with darker color patterns on the ears, face (mask), tail, legs, and feet. This distinctive point pattern comes from recessive genes that cause the production of melanin (dark pigment) only in cooler areas of the skin.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Dry cat food can help keep a cat's teeth and gums healthy, while wet food provides fluids for cats that may not drink enough water. Be sure to provide fresh, clean water so your cat has easy access.</p><p>While many cats moderate what they eat naturally, some will overeat if they have free access to food. If you see your cat gaining weight, you may want to provide two meals a day and take away any uneaten portions.</p><p>Your cat may need a modified diet with advancing age. Discuss your cat's nutritional needs with your veterinarian. Avoiding obesity is the best way to allow your cat to live to a healthy older age.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Siamese Cat</h2><h2>Siamese Cat Overview</h2><p>Siamese cats are almost dog-like in their tendency to bond and communicate with humans. They are very social and love interaction with people and other pets, making them a great choice for busy households.

107,https://www.thesprucepets.com/scottish-fold-profile-551898,Cats > Cat Breeds > Short-Haired Cat Breeds,"<h1>Scottish Fold: Breed Profile, Characteristics & Care</h1>","<h1>Scottish Fold: Breed Profile, Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>Appearance, Personality, History, Care, & Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The Scottish fold cat is a sweet-tempered, short-haired breed with an unusual trait for which it is named: folded ears. The cat's small ears fold forward and downward, giving it a unique countenance that almost resembles an owl. The trait can be traced back to a barn cat in Scotland that carried the mutated gene that became the basis for the breed. Unfortunately, the gene for folded ears is also associated with a painful skeletal disorder.</p><p>While the ethics of breeding Scottish fold cats is controversial due to the potential for anatomical deformity, the practice continues because people love this attentive, devoted, and interesting-looking feline.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Fold</p><p>Personality: Affectionate and sociable but not demanding<br/></p><p>Weight: Up to 11 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 30 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair; a long-haired variant is less common</p><p>Coat Colors: Brown, gray, black, red, cream, white</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby, tortoiseshell, and calico</p><p>Eye Color: Green, blue-green, and gold</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 14 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Scotland</p><h2>Scottish Fold Characteristics</h2><p>This breed is known for its easygoing temperament and general sociability. It usually gets along great with cat-friendly dogs and other cats and adapts well to multi-pet households. Children who are old enough to respect this cat and not handle it roughly will make fast friends with the Scottish fold, whose affectionate personality is both comforting and endearing to people of all ages.</p><p>The Scottish fold doesn't need a lot of active engagement or strenuous exercise to be happy; it will thrive in a household where casual play is balanced with plenty of quiet cuddle time.</p><h2>History of the Scottish Fold</h2><p>The first Scottish fold was a barn cat named Susie discovered on a farm in Perthshire, Scotland in 1961. She had a natural mutation for folded ears, which she passed on to half of her kittens. Neighboring farmer William Ross began breeding the kittens and consulted with a geneticist. Sadly, Susie died after getting hit by a car, but her daughter Snooks perpetuated her line.</p><p>It soon became known that Scottish fold kittens are not born with folded ears. The ears of the kittens that carry the gene begin folding somewhere around 21 days of age, starting with the outer edge of the ear near the base.</p><p>The fold gene is an incomplete autosomal dominant gene that affects the development of cartilage and bone throughout the cat's body.</p><p>A cat that has two copies of the gene is said to be homozygous. Cats that have two copies of the gene that produces folded ears can have severe health problems, including a skeletal disorder called osteochondrodysplasia that can cause crippling arthritis at a young age. Homozygous cats are not bred for obvious ethical reasons.</p><p>Cats that have one copy of the gene are heterozygous. They should display the folded ear characteristic but be somewhat healthier. They may develop arthritis but usually at an older age. There is controversy about whether these cats have a good quality of life or suffer pain and disability.</p><p>Cats with folded ears are bred to cats that do not display the folded ear trait to ensure none of the litter receives two copies of the gene. It is best not to breed a heterozygous Scottish fold with a Scottish fold that had straight ears, but instead to out-breed with a British shorthair. The concern is that Scottish folds that have straight ears may still have the gene but not express it.</p><p>Many veterinarians oppose breeding Scottish folds because any cat with the folded ear gene has osteochondrodysplasia, which will affect the cat to some degree and may cause pain or debilitation. Debates are active in countries where breeding continues.</p><p>While the breed was registered with the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy (GCCF) in the United Kingdom, this was withdrawn in 1971 due to ethical concerns about the health of the cats. However, breeding continued in the United States and elsewhere. They are accepted by the American Cat Fanciers' Association (ACFA), Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA), and The International Cat Association (TICA).</p><h2>Scottish Fold Care</h2><p>Scottish folds have dense fur that may need weekly brushing to help prevent hairballs.</p><p>Trim your cat's nails every couple of weeks and provide a scratching post. Maintain good dental hygiene by brushing your cat's teeth at least weekly. Pay attention to your Scottish fold's ears and check them weekly for any signs of irritation, mites, or infection. The fold of the ears can make these cats slightly more prone to ear infections due to decreased airflow.</p><p>Scottish folds are moderately active. They like to be around their humans and play interactive toy games. Provide a cat tree for climbing and surveying the room even Scottish folds want to get ""above it all"" once in a while.<br/></p><p>When petting or playing with a fold, handle its tail gently. These cats commonly have stiff tails that may be painful to bend or pull.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The biggest health concern for Scottish folds is a genetic skeletal disease called osteochondrodysplasia that affects cartilage and bone development. If you are checking a cat for possible purchase or adoption, look for a stiff tail, stiff leg joints, or any movement problem in the legs or feet which may be a sign that the cat is affected by osteochondrodysplasia. The condition is likely to worsen over time.</p><p>Even with the prevalence of osteochondrodysplasia, Scottish folds have a normal feline lifespan. Unfortunately, they may experience more discomfort in their lives than other breeds.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Folded ears are the most unusual feature of a Scottish fold cat, but its general appearance is also notably round. Both its head and its body tend to be rather orb-shaped, with stocky legs and a somewhat stubby tail that accentuate the cat's overall roundness. Their large eyes are also close to circular.</p><p>Scottish folds are medium-sized cats that are more likely to have short, dense hair than long, and their coats come in a variety of colors and patterns.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A Scottish fold should receive the same type of feeding as any domestic cat with an emphasis on weight control since obesity puts extra strain on the skeleton and can lead to diseases like diabetes. You can choose wet or dry food or a combination.</p><p>Your cat's needs will change throughout its life, and you should consult your veterinarian for nutritional recommendations. Be sure to monitor your pet for obesity as that can shorten a cat's lifespan.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Scottish Fold</h2><h2>Scottish Fold Overview</h2><p>There is no question as to the charm and friendliness of the Scottish fold cat. It is calm, affectionate, and adaptable to most households.

These spunky dogs were originally bred to chase and trap prey like foxes, badgers, and vermin for local hunters and farmers in harsh, rural Welsh landscapes. The breed still retains many of the character traits that appealed to its owners hundreds of years ago. Welsh Terriers are full of character, but potential adopters should be aware that these dogs are best suited for experienced owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 20 to 22 pounds</p><p>Coat: Dense, hard, and wiry outer coat with a soft undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Tan and black</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Independent, energetic, friendly, alert, confident, courageous</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Wales</p><h2>Characteristics of the Welsh Terrier</h2><p>The Welsh Terrier is not ideal for the faint-hearted or novice owner. They have huge personalities, which can be challenging to manage without early socialization and training.</p><p>These dogs are known to be free spirits rather than companion dogs. They can form strong bonds with their family, but they are not overly affectionate, and they often retain independence. On the contrary, they are also fun-loving, happy, and full of life.</p><p>Welsh Terriers are highly intelligent and excellent problem solvers, but they can get into mischief and make their own amusement if they aren't stimulated. They can live alongside older, respectful children thanks to their playful and loyal nature. Their assertive traits, however, mean that they aren't usually suited to homes with young children unless interactions are closely managed. They can be prone to resource guarding and may even chase at the heels of small toddlers.<br/></p><h2>History of the Welsh Terrier</h2><p>While its exact origin year is unknown, the Welsh Terrier is regarded as one of the oldest terrier breeds. Native to Wales, there are references to black and red terriers as far back as the 15th century.</p><p>In the 18th century, this type of dog became more popular in the rugged, mountainous regions of Wales among farmers and hunters of foxes, otters, rodents, and badgers. It takes a courageous, tenacious, and robust dog to dig an aggressive badger from its sett, and this breed was certainly up to the task.</p><p>By the 19th century, the Welsh Terrier became more popular, and the scruffy-looking breed was refined for the show ring. In their early days, these dogs were simply classified as Old English Terriers (along with several other terrier breeds). The Kennel Club recognized the Welsh Terrier in the UK in 1887, and it was around this time that the breed was exported to the United States.</p><p>Welsh Terriers are still relatively rare, but those that fall for the charms of this feisty, characterful dog often become enthusiasts. U.S. President JFK owned a Welsh Terrier named Charlie, and U.K. Prime Minister Clement Attlee was also a fan of the breed.</p><h2>Welsh Terrier Care</h2><p>Because of its origins in hunting, the Welsh Terrier requires plenty of exercise to stay happy and healthy. This breed has relatively simple grooming needs, but training can be more complicated when it comes to obedience, socialization, and recall.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed still retains working traits from its origins, and Welsh Terriers have plenty of energy that needs an appropriate outlet. Provide at least an hour of daily exercise and plenty of mental stimulation to prevent problem behaviors from surfacing as a result of boredom.</p><p>These dogs are known for sometimes being prolific diggers another throwback to their working days. While this is a fun way for your dog to get its energy out, it can become an issue if it happens regularly. Some owners provide sandpits and other designated areas in the yard to give Welsh Terriers an appropriate outlet for this passion.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Welsh Terriers have a low-maintenance grooming regime. They just require a brush out once a week and a clip or hand-strip occasionally to keep their coats in check. Like all dog breeds, it's also important to trim the nails and brush the teeth routinely.</p><p>Although no breed is truly non-shedding, their double coats hold in most excess hair. This makes them an attractive hypoallergenic dog for those with allergies.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Welsh Terriers are intelligent dogs, but they can also be stubborn and strong-willed. It's best to use positive training methods with this breed; be prepared with plenty of patience and treats.</p><p>These dogs often have assertive personalities, so while some may love other dogs, they don't always hit it off. Plan for careful introductions (especially in multi-dog households). Some owners find success raising Welsh Terriers in homes with cats, but their high prey drive means they're best-suited to homes without other small pets.</p><p>These hunting instincts mean that teaching a solid recall is especially important. This breed should not be let off-leash outside of a safely enclosed fence. Training should also be focused on managing alert barking, as your Welsh Terrier is likely to be vocal.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Welsh Terriers are generally considered a healthy breed, and it is not unheard of for them to reach ages as old as 18. But like many purebred dogs, they're also prone to certain inheritable conditions.</p><p>Always adopt from a reputable breeder that has performed appropriate health screens for PLL and primary glaucoma on prospective parents.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Welsh Terriers, as with every dog, should be fed a high-quality and appropriately portion-controlled diet. This breed typically needs about a cup of food per day, but to avoid too much weight gain, talk with your veterinarian to determine a feeding schedule for your specific dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><p>Because they can be more prone to food allergies, opt for foods with simple ingredients. Introduce new foods one at a time and monitor your dog for any adverse reactions.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Welsh Terrier</h2><p>If you're interested in adopting a Welsh Terrier, it's helpful to start your search with breed-specific rescues or by checking local shelters. Offering a forever home to a Welsh Terrier or similar breed can be a very rewarding experience.</p><p>Welsh Terriers are a rare dog breed, so it's common for prospective owners to join waiting lists or travel to find puppies. If you're set on adopting a puppy, start by researching responsible breeders that perform medical tests on litter parents and provide their dogs with a safe, comfortable environment. This breed can be more expensive than others, typically costing between $1,000 and $4,000 for a puppy (with some prices ranging higher depending on pedigree and availability).</p><h2>Welsh Terrier Overview</h2><p>Well-suited to an active and outdoorsy family</p><p>Minimal shedding</p><p>Full of personality and can be playful</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Independent and sometimes assertive nature</p><p>Prone to alert barking</p>",1092
109,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cavapoo-full-profile-history-and-care-5079745,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hybrid Dog Breeds,<h1>Cavapoo: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Cavapoo: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>A mix of both the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel and the poodle, the cavapoo (sometimes called Cavadoodle or Cavoodle) is a small dog breed with soft, curly or wavy fur that was first bred in Australia. With parents from the AKC's toy and non-sporting groups, this lovable and compact dog is known for its companionable nature.</p><p>Cavapoos have become increasingly popular in the U.S. over the past few decades, and they adapt well to most settings. The playful, easygoing personalities of these dogs make them a great fit for most families with children.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Not recognized by the AKC<br/>Height: 11 to 14 inches (males); 9 to 11 inches (females)<br/>Weight: 10 to 20 pounds (males); 9 to 15 pounds (females)<br/>Coat: Medium length, wavy or curly coat<br/>Coat Color: Cream, fawn, chocolate, gold, chestnut, tri-color; Can be solid or have white markings<br/>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, affectionate, gentle, playful, loyal, even-tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Australia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Cavapoo</h2><p>Cavapoos are a great fit for a variety of lifestyles. They prefer being in the company of their owners rather than in a kennel, so prepare for them to be filled with excitement when you come home from being out. It's best to adopt this breed if you're planning to spend plenty of time with them. Cavapoos are especially affectionate with their families and tend to have a quiet, calm temperament when they're not exercising. They can also be quite energetic thanks to their playful personalities.</p><h2>History of the Cavapoo</h2><p>Poodle mixes, including the cavapoo, have become increasingly popular in the United States in recent decades. These mixes blend the personality traits of one breed in this case, the Cavalier King Charles Spaniel's good-naturedness with the low shedding and hypoallergenic traits of poodles. Although the sudden popularity of cavapoos may make them seem to be a newer breed, it is believed that they were first bred in the 1950s in Australia.</p><h2>Cavapoo Care</h2><p>Like other designer dogs, cavapoos require a bit more grooming than some popular short-haired breeds because of their curly coats. However, the cavapoo is also highly trainable, eager to please, and it only requires a medium amount of exercise to stay happy and healthy.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite the cavapoo's high energy, this breed actually has moderate exercise requirements, only needing daily walks. This, combined with their small stature, makes them suitable for apartments and urban life. They certainly have the energy to keep up with children, but as with all pets, make sure that your children have adult supervision when playing with your cavapoo. Keep in mind that these dogs are on the smaller side, so there is a higher risk of injury with a playful child that gets a little carried away with their roughhousing.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Cavapoos have soft, medium-length fur that can range from wavy to curly and requires regular grooming. They are known for shedding very little, making them an ideal breed for those with allergies to pet dander. Their lack of shedding doesn't mean they don't need routine brushing, however. If your cavapoo isn't brushed at least once to twice a week, its wavy curls may start to mat. Aside from being uncomfortable and sometimes even painful, mats can make the skin underneath prone to infections. Some owners may opt to have their dog's fur cut short into a 'puppy cut' to help prevent matting.</p><p>In addition to brushing, your cavapoo should get his or her nails trimmed routinely to prevent them from snagging or breaking. They also need their ears cleaned to prevent infection, and it's important to clean or trim the fur inside the ears.</p><p>As a smaller breed, cavapoos are prone to dental disease. Brushing your cavapoo's teeth daily, or as often as you can manage, with dog-friendly toothpaste can help keep its teeth clean and healthy. Dental disease is not merely a cosmetic issue. Gingival tissue is vascular, and it is the number one area where bacteria can enter the bloodstream. This can lead to painful tooth abscesses, but it can also cause a heart condition known as endocarditis (inflammation of the heart muscle). Proper dental hygiene is especially important for breeds that are susceptible to dental problems.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Cavapoos are intelligent, highly trainable, and eager to please their owners. This breed can easily be trained (starting as early as 12 weeks of age) in basic obedience with positive reinforcement-based training. Marking the desired behavior with a treat or praise can help reinforce good behavior.</p><p>Because they are so closely bonded to their owners, cavapoos are also prone to suffering from separation anxiety. If you have to leave the house often, it's best to seek a trainer with behavioral experience avoid those that use 'aversives' or 'corrections,' as these methods might further stress an anxious pet. Work with a certified trainer who has positive feedback from other dog owners.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Cavapoos are prone to diseases seen commonly in both Cavalier King Charles Spaniels as well as poodles. Reputable breeders will screen their spaniels, poodles, and cavapoo puppies for these illnesses and avoid breeding dogs with genetic diseases.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Cavapoos tend to thrive on nutritious diets made for small to medium-sized, high-energy dogs. Although the weight range for the breed doesn't seem very large, it can actually vary widely. A 9-pound cavapoo is much smaller than a 20-pound cavapoo and will require much less dog food per day.</p><p>Depending on their size and activity, your cavapoo may require anywhere from 1/2 cup to 1 cup of food per day. Although this breed has a high energy level, it's still prone to canine obesity. Your veterinarian can provide a diet plan for your specific dog to maintain a healthy weight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cavapoo</h2><p>Cavapoos are relatively popular dogs. Despite being considered ""designer,"" they are also surrendered at shelters like most other breeds. If you are interested in adding a cavapoo to your family, it's best to adopt one from a local shelter.</p><p>If you haven't found any cavapoos at shelters, it's important to ensure that any breeder you use is reputable. These puppies typically cost between $1,00 and $2,000, but prices may vary depending on location and pedigree. The breed's popularity also makes them a common choice for puppy mills. To adopt a healthy dog raised in a safe environment, general rules of thumb include avoiding commercial pet shops and breeders that don't let you see the parents (or where they're kept).</p><h2>Cavapoo Overview</h2><p>Affectionate</p><p>Low shedding and hypoallergenic</p><p>Size and adaptability make them good for apartment living</p><p>Weekly to twice weekly brushing required</p><p>Prone to separation anxiety</p><p>Prone to dental disease, heart conditions, and eye problems</p>",1087

The dog is recognized for its usually hairless body, but it does have eyebrows and whiskers, along with its signature erect, alert ears. What the AHT lacks in fur it makes up for with its energetic, bright, and fun-loving personality.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 12 to 16 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 to 16 pounds</p><p>COAT: Completely hairless except for whiskers and guard hairs on the eyebrows and muzzle; coated variety has a soft, short, and dense coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Any color combination; even the hairless variety will have solid or patterned skin pigmentation that can vary greatly</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 14 to 16 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Playful, inquisitive, alert, intelligent, lively, loving</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the American Hairless Terrier</h2><p>If you're looking for a big personality in a little body, and one that is likely to be a bit of a challenge but lots of fun, then the American hairless terrier could be for you. However, if you're looking for a little lapdog, this isn't the breed for you. The dog may be small, but it's driven, athletic, and has lots of stamina.</p><h2>History of the American Hairless Terrier</h2><p>The American hairless terrier is a newbie on the block, and the only hairless breed of dogs native to the United States.</p><p>Its history can be easily traced back to 1972 when a female hairless rat terrier named Josephine was born in a litter bred by Edwin Scott. Scott didn't realize this anomaly had happened at first as all AHTs are born with a downy hair covering that falls out after a few weeks.</p><p>Scott bred from Josephine and the dog's descendants to produce more hairless types of terriers. At first, the dogs were simply referred to as rat terriers of the hairless variety.</p><p>The Scotts continued their careful breeding program, and in 2016 the American hairless terrier was officially recognized by the AKC.</p><p>Because there's still a very small gene pool, some American hairless terriers are still born with a thin coat, and these are referred to as a coated AHT.</p><p>The American hairless terrier retains many of the characteristics of its rat terrier descendants. These dogs, developed in the early 19th century in England, were used as ratters and they were nicknamed ""feists"" because of their feisty little personalities.</p><h2>American Hairless Terrier Care</h2><p>An AHT is very energetic and often regarded as more affectionate than some terrier-types, but this dog can also be pretty spunky, so you need to be ready to put in the work to train it about boundaries.</p><p>The breed can get along well with other dogs with the right introductions, but be aware that it often has a bossy personality and will want to rule the roost. However, an AHT still has a built-in prey drive and may not be amenable to living alongside smaller furry pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>An American hairless terrier is a smart dog that likes to have a job to do. If it's left on its own too much during the day and not given enough exercise or enrichment, problem behaviors can start to surface. The AHT likes short bursts of activity (and not in the direct sun), so a few short walks a day totaling about 30 minutes, plus a quick game of fetch indoors or outdoors, should suffice for exercise.</p><p>You may also find your AHT inherited another terrier passion digging. Providing your dog with a designated digging pit or rewarding alternative, more desirable actions can help to prevent this from becoming a problem.</p><p>If the dog is particularly adventurous and you often take it off-the-beaten-track, you'll have to watch out for it trying to tackle thorny undergrowth as the dog could more easily damage its skin.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>An American hairless terrier requires basic grooming, but with extra care when it comes to the dog's skin. An AHT commonly won't have a coat, so the dog's skin is very exposed, and this brings additional care considerations. About once a week or so bathe with a mild dog shampoo and pat your dog's skin dry. in hot weather conditions, you may need to apply a moisturizing sunscreen (try a sunscreen formulated for infants and toddlers) and even cover its body against the sun.</p><p>In the cold weather, an AHT will need a practical and well-fitting coat outdoors while exercising, and the dog may even need to wear a fleecy sweater indoors if your home is drafty.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>You'll need to work hard on your AHT's rock-solid recall and keep the dog on leash in areas where there may be too much temptation for it to start a chase. This smart breed also has a stubborn streak, and trying to force the AHT while training could backfire quickly. Instead, it responds well to reward-based training methods. Keep any training sessions short, varied and fun, and you'll see good results.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The American hairless terrier is a new breed, so research is still ongoing about the inheritable conditions that could affect this dog.</p><p>When selecting your puppy, make sure you go to a reputable breeder that performs appropriate health checks on the parents before breeding.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, you should feed your American hairless terrier a high-quality and properly portion-controlled diet. The amount you feed your dog will depend on its size and level of activity.</p><p>Obesity is a major problem with the dog population in North America, and it can lead to a host of more serious health problems. Keep an eye on your AHT's body condition and avoid feeding unhealthy treats and table scraps to your dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American Hairless Terrier</h2><p>The American hairless terrier is still a very rare breed, even in North America. To secure a puppy from a reputable breeder, you may need to get onto a waiting list or travel further afield. Expect to pay about $1,500 up to $4,000 for a purebred AHT. While it will be very rare to find an AHT available for adoption, there are lots of other wonderful terrier-types looking for forever homes in shelters across the country.</p><h2>American Hairless Terrier Overview</h2><p>Fun-loving and affectionate</p><p>Very low-maintenance grooming regime</p><p>Energetic</p><p>Not lapdogs and tend to be independent</p><p>Skin needs protection in extreme weather conditions</p><p>Can have a high prey drive</p>",1044

Easily recognized by their brilliant reddish mahogany color and beautiful eyes full of expression, these hard-working hounds are well-suited to both hunting and companionship. Redbones are also known for their voices like most hounds, they bay. Some find the Redbone's bay rather sweet and song-like, while others find it irritating.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 21 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Deep, solid red</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, independent, energetic, intelligent, fun-loving, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Redbone Coonhound</h2><p>Though the Redbone coonhound is an energetic hunting dog with a short attention span, it's actually a laidback breed and easy to be around with its goofy yet soulful personality. Redbones are scent hounds, so the dog will sniff everything with great concentration and intensity. These dogs have lovable personalities, making them desirable family pets.</p><h2>History of the Redbone Coonhound</h2><p>Redbone coonhounds originated from red foxhounds brought to the United States by Scottish immigrants in the late 18th century. While you might think their name comes from their color, it actually derives from the name of an early breeder, Peter Redbone.</p><p>The majority of the breed's development took place in the Southeastern United States, especially in the state of Georgia. Over time, the Scottish foxhounds were bred for raccoon-hunting traits and were eventually crossed with Irish hounds and possibly bloodhounds which led to the Redbone coonhound we know today. Originally the Redbone's coats featured a black saddleback streak, but through years of breeding their fur evolved into its notable red color.</p><p>By the end of the 19th century, the Redbone coonhound was a well-established breed. Redbones have continued to act as excellent hunters and loyal companions. The Redbone coonhound was officially accepted into the American Kennel Club (AKC) hound group in 2009, yet they're still rare outside of North America.</p><h2>Redbone Coonhound Care</h2><p>Redbone coonhounds can be great family dogs when properly trained. Socialization is equally important for a Redbone as exercise. This breed is generally friendly to everyone, which makes it a poor guard dog but a good companion. True to its hunting dog roots, this dog is usually not excessively clingy with its owner. Another advantage is that this breed has low-maintenance grooming needs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed has loads of energy and can easily become bored, so adequate exercise is essential as much as 90 minutes per day is recommended by some experts. These hounds are excellent swimmers, so this is another option to fulfill the dog's movement needs.</p><p>Redbones should be kept on a leash or in a fenced-in area and not permitted to roam free. Once they catch an interesting scent, they'll follow it with intensity. With a strong desire to hunt, this hound can get pretty far very fast. Taking your dog for a long walk with lots of opportunities to sniff will help to keep him happy and stimulated.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Redbone coonhounds have short, smooth coats with a fairly low rate of shedding. Routine basic grooming with weekly brushing is all that's typically necessary to keep Redbones looking their best. They tend to have a distinctive musky hound odor, which you can keep at bay with regular bathing.</p><p>Like all dogs with long floppy ears, it's important to keep the ears clean and dry to prevent infection. Trim your dog's nails to prevent splitting and tears. Brush your dog's teeth a couple of times each week at a minimum for good dental hygiene and to help prevent gum infections.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Redbones are intelligent dogs, but they can also have a stubborn streak. Proper training is an absolute necessity and will help strengthen the bond between you and your dog. They're easily trained for hunting duties but other mundane commands don't click as naturally. They need lots of patience and persistence when being trained as they're said to be prone to canine Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). As common to most hounds, they're also known to creatively interpret your commands rather than follow them in the way you intended.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Redbone coonhounds are generally very healthy dogs. The breed can sustain running injuries while on the hunt, however. Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A Redbone coonhound will need about 2.5 cups of dry dog food per day. It's best to give two smaller meals per day rather than one large meal or allowing free feeding. They're known to be enthusiastic eaters and are prone to overeating.</p><p>Be sure to monitor your pet to see whether he is gaining weight. Obesity can shorten a dog's lifespan and put him at risk for other conditions. Discuss an overweight dog with your veterinarian to get recommendations for a feeding schedule, food amount, dog food type, and exercise needs.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Redbone Coonhound</h2><p>Before searching for a Redbone, think about whether you can give it enough exercise, whether you have any other small animals in your home, and if you're able to bathe it to control its hound odor.</p><p>These groups will be able to pair you with a reputable breeder or rescue in your local area. If you aren't certain the breed is right for you, you may be able to try foster care to test if a Redbone coonhound is an ideal pet for your home and lifestyle.</p><h2>Redbone Coonhound Overview</h2><p>Minimal shedding</p><p>Great hunting companions</p><p>Energetic and lively</p><p>Poor guard dogs</p><p>Challenging to train for long periods</p><p>Loud baying and howling</p>",933

The podenco is comprised of a group of sighthounds commonly used for hunting rabbits.</p><p>While all of the podenco types share common characteristics, they can vary greatly in size and appearance. However, they all have large prick ears that give them a distinctive appearance. Pods range from the almost dachshund-shaped podenco maneto, to the much larger podenco Andaluz. They are often all just referred to simply as podenco (or , which is the Portuguese word for the same dog breed), rather than by the specific type as often it can be difficult to determine their true lineage.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: Varies greatly, from as small as 13 inches to 28 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: Varies greatly, from around 18 pounds to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: Smooth, wire, or long-coated</p><p>COAT COLOR: A wide variety of colors, with most common combinations of shades of brown or red, and often with white markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Active, intelligent, sensitive, friendly, enthusiastic</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Spain</p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Podenco</h2><p>Regardless of the type of podenco you have, you can expect it to be a very high-energy dog that develops a close bond with its family. Pods can be goofy and playful, and also sometimes a touch mischievous.</p><h2>History of the Podenco</h2><p>Podencos are often confused with the basenji and the pharaoh hounds. Similar-looking dogs with tall upright ears and the distinctive sighthound shape have been seen in the tombs of ancient Egyptians, including Tutankhamen.</p><p>It is theorized that the Phoenician merchants (an ancient civilization originating in Lebanon), were the first to bring these types of dogs over the Mediterranean Sea. They introduced them when traveling along the coastal trade routes from Africa to Spain as far back as the 8th century BC.</p><p>The dogs were thought to have landed on the islands off the coast and this is how some of the island-specific podenco type dogs developed. These included the podenco Canario, from the Canary Islands, and the podenco Ibicenco (the Ibizan hound).</p><p>The dogs began to flourish as rural hunting dogs across Spain, and the different types of podenco dogs started to develop across the regions, adapting to their hunting terrain. They are more robust and suited to rougher terrain than the galgo, another commonly used Spanish hunting dog.</p><p>Today, the podenco is still used as a hunting dog but rather than being revered, they are often seen as just a tool. They are frequently abused, neglected, and abandoned. They often learn to survive on the street or are surrendered to high kill shelters. As their plight is gaining more recognition, there are now several charities that work to offer forever homes to podencos, nationally and internationally. This means that podencos are gradually becoming more well-known in the U.S.</p><h2>Podenco Care</h2><p>Although pods can enjoy lots of snuggles with their owners, they are not known for being couch potatoes like their greyhound or galgo relatives. Their stamina and hunting roots mean that these dogs do need a lot of exercise and stimulation. They also typically have basic grooming needs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite the type of podenco you have, it will need between one and two hours of daily exercise, including walks and interactive playtime. The podenco's athleticism means that it can often enjoy taking part in dog sports like agility or canicross (competitive running with your dog).</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Podenco coat types can vary quite a bit. Most commonly, pods have a short, smooth coat or a wire-haired variety. A weekly brush out is usually sufficient to remove any molting hairs and keep the skin and coat shiny and healthy.</p><p>Care should be taken to trim the nails to ensure that they do not become overgrown. This can impact your dog's gait and subsequently its joints. If the nails grow too much, they can also curl in on themselves, and this can lead to pain and possible infection.</p><p>Check your dog's ears weekly for dirt, wax buildup, and other abnormalities. Aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>A podenco can sometimes have a stubborn, independent streak, but the dog does respond well to positive reinforcement training. You may require a little more patience than with, say, an eager-to-please Labrador!</p><p>The pod's hunting background also means that it can have a very high prey drive, and you may need to work hard on achieving a rock-solid recall. You will probably also have to work on training a reliable ""drop it"" and ""leave it"" command.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Podencos are generally regarded as being hardy, healthy, and robust dogs. Because there is not a general breed standard, it means that they do not suffer from as many inheritable conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with every dog, your podenco should be fed on a high-quality and appropriately portion-controlled diet. If the dog has spent some of its life on the streets or has had to fight for its food, you may find that it can be prone to scavenging, and this can lead to tummy upsets. Feeding your pod from interactive treat toys and slow feeders can help to make your pup feel fuller, and it also helps to keep the dog stimulated too.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Podenco</h2><p>The only podenco type that is recognized by the American Kennel Club is the Ibizan hound. If you do wish to work with a breeder to bring home an Ibizan hound puppy, or another type of podenco, you should make sure that you do your research. Make sure that you seek out a reputable breeder that allows you to visit the puppies in a home environment. They should not be separated from their mother before they are fully weaned. They should be at least eight weeks old before coming home.</p><p>If you choose to work with a breeder, the cost of podenco puppies can cost on average $1,000. However, since the Ibizan hound is a recognized AKC breed, you may pay about $2,000 to $2,500 for that specific type of puppy.</p><p>Many rescue organizations are involved in bringing podencos looking for forever homes over from Spain. Always make sure that the organization you choose has a solid reputation. The dogs should have had full health checks, been safely transported, and have been properly assessed in terms of temperament. The organization should provide comprehensive post-adoption support too.</p><h2>Podenco Overview</h2><p>Thrives in the company of family and other dogs</p><p>Well-suited for an active family</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming regime</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Strong-willed and requires extra patience during training</p><p>Not suited for a family with a sedentary lifestyle</p>",1093

While they excel at having a job, they're equally as happy existing alongside their family members, with lots of play and adventure involved. They have joyful personalities and silly demeanors that bring a smile to their owner's face on a daily basis.</p><h2>History of the Black Mouth Cur</h2><p>The exact origin of the Black Mouth Cur is unknown, but the breed was developed in the southern United States and was used by early settlers to hunt game, protect their homes and livestock, and help out on the ranch. </p><p>There are a number of different Black Mouth Cur lines throughout the US. The Texas Black Mouth Cur, for example, is a cattle-herding line. Another line, the Southern Black Mouth Cur, purportedly originated in Alabama and is popular with ranchers looking for livestock guardians and hunters.</p><h2>Black Mouth Cur Care</h2><p>All things considered, Black Mouth Curs are a relatively low-key and easy to care for breed, with attainable needs when it comes to exercise, grooming, and training.

It's also known for its thick, dense coat, small eyes, and signature spitz tail that curls up over its back. The Karelian is known to keep bears away from human-inhabited areas of state parks, but it's not a breed that shows up often as a pet in American households.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 19 to 23.5 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 44 to 49 pounds</p><p>COAT: Dense and short</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black with white markings  </p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Cautious, independent, loyal, territorial, brave, tenacious</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Northwestern Europe</p><h2>Characteristics of the Karelian Bear Dog</h2><p>The most notable characteristic of a Karelian bear dog is its fearlessness. Though not a large canine, this dog is bred to corner huge and frightening animals but not to kill them, which can make this breed an excellent guard dog or watchdog. The Karelian is highly spirited and energetic, which often can overwhelm new dog owners. The breed is also very loyal and protective of its human family, but care should be taken when the dog is in the presence of young children.</p><h2>History of the Karelian Bear Dog</h2><p>The Karelian bear dog is an ancient dog breed that shares its ancestry with the now-extinct Komi dog. Being an ancient dog breed, it has been difficult for experts to determine the specifics of the breed's origin. However, evidence suggests that the Karelian bear dog may have originated in Northwestern Europe and was used by Finnish and Russian farmers and hunters because of the breed's hunting skills.</p><p>This breed is uncommon in the U.S. but is one of the top 10 most common breeds in Finland. In the U.S. The Wind River Bear Institute, which aims to reduce human-caused bear mortality and conflicts worldwide, also utilizes Karelian bear dogs to teach the bears to stay away from areas populated by humans.</p><p>The Karelian bear dog is rare enough that it was placed into the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service, which is a breed registry specifically for the documentation of rare breeds within the U.S. Owners of rare breeds work to get the dogs recognized in the U.S. by logging the birth and parentage of each dog. The breed was allowed to start competing in AKC companion events in 2008. But there are still only a few hundred Karelians in the U.S.</p><h2>Karelian Bear Dog Care</h2><p>Though a Karelian bear dog can be affectionate and loyal to its owner, the dog is still considered wilder rather than domesticated. If you are bringing a Karelian into your home, it's important to begin socialization at a young age because of the hunting aspect of the dog's personality. Fortunately, even without a bear to hunt or a farm to guard, there are plenty of opportunities to keep a working dog like the Karelian busy.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Karelians are energetic, athletic, and have a tenacious work ethic, so providing them with daily exercise and job to do is extremely important; it does not necessarily have to be in the form of productive work but can include focused play.</p><p>The dog will need a vigorous daily walk of one hour and keep your Karelian on a leash during the walk. However, the dog will need much more daily exercise than one walk. Offer a Karelian activities such as dog puzzle toys, scent work, long exploratory hikes, rally obedience, and agility training.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Karelian requires basic grooming but with a bit more attention on its all-weather coat that is short but dense. The coat only requires minimal grooming, brushing it once to twice weekly to remove loose fur and prevent matting along with the occasional bath will keep your dog looking its best. As with other dog breeds, nails should be trimmed every three to four weeks as needed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed is intelligent, and when trained with consistency and patience, the dog learns quickly. Karelians respond well to positive reinforcement with toy and food rewards, a stable routine, and lots of love. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>There are no genetic or common health problems known to be directly linked with this breed.</p><p>Annual vet visits will help your pet maintain optimum health and prevent and recognize any problems sooner. If you intend to buy a Karelian from a breeder, ask about any health tests given to the parents.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Karelian bear dog should be fed high-quality dog food, whether commercially manufactured or home-prepared, with your veterinarian's supervision and approval. </p><p>Any diet should be appropriate to the dog's age and activity level. Because this breed is very active, consider a working or active breed formula to account for the dog's high-energy needs. Always make sure that they have clean and fresh water that's easily accessible and available. Check with your veterinarian if you have any questions or concerns about your dog's weight or diet. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Karelian Bear Dog</h2><p>The Karelian bear dog is not a common breed found in the U.S., so finding one for a pet might be difficult. If you find a breeder, expect to pay approximately $1,700.</p><h2>Karelian Bear Dog Overview</h2><p>No breed-specific genetic health issues</p><p>Protective nature makes it an excellent watchdog</p><p>Intelligence makes it fairly easy to train</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise for high energy level</p><p>Bred to be naturally aggressive requiring socialization</p><p>Not suitable for apartment dwellers</p>",885

The Akita has distinctive physical characteristics, including its short, thick, double coat, thick neck, erect triangular ears, and full, upright curled tail, all of which make it look like a big and cuddly stuffed animal. In general, the Akita is deliberate, strong-willed, and quiet although it will bark when it thinks necessary. Overall, the Akita makes an excellent protector as well as a valued companion, but it's not recommended as a family dog with small children and other pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 26 to 28 inches (males); 24 to 26 inches (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 100 to 130 pounds (males); 70 to 100 pounds (females)</p><p>COAT: Short, thick, double-layered coat and some Akitas have a recessive gene that gives them a long coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Brindle and pinto (each with white markings)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, loyal, independent, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Japan</p><h2>Characteristics of the Akita</h2><p>While the Akita can be surprisingly sweet and affectionate with family members, this breed best suits an experienced owner and a home without young children or other dogs. If you have a small household and decide the Akita is the right breed for you, you will have a loyal and steadfast companion for life.</p><h2>History of the Akita</h2><p>The Akita is a native of Japan and was named for its region of origin. The breed was developed as a watchdog and all-purpose hunter in the mountains of northern Japan, where it can be traced back several hundred years or more. Traditionally, the Akita represents health and good luck to the Japanese people. Japan declared the Akita a Japanese Natural Monument in 1931 and they instituted a breed standard in 1934.</p><p>World War II and the privations in Japan resulted in a government order to kill all of the Akitas. Some were only saved by being turned loose in the mountains or crossbreeding them with German shepherds. After the war, efforts began to reestablish the breed through careful breeding of the survivors and efforts to eliminate the characteristics of crosses with other breeds.</p><p>It is believed that the first Akita in the U.S. was brought over in 1937 by Helen Keller, who grew fond of the breed while traveling in Japan. After World War II, when Akitas were brought to the U.S. by servicemen, the popularity of the breed began to grow. The Akita was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1972.</p><p>Japanese Akita standards differ from American Akita standards. The Japanese Akitas have a limited range of colors while American Akitas are accepted in all colors. The American Akita retained more of the crossbred characteristics and are larger and heavier-boned. American Akitas have a bear-like head while Japanese Akitas have a more fox-like head. While American Akitas often have a dark mask, that is not allowed by Japanese standards.</p><p>The loyalty of the Akita is epitomized by the dog Hachiko, born in 1923, and owned by a Toyko professor. Hachiko accompanied the professor to the train each day and returned to escort him home each afternoon. When the professor died at work, he continued to walk to and from the station each day for nine years.</p><h2>Akita Care</h2><p>Akitas are very powerful, strong, and athletic, which means they require plenty of exercise and serious training. They are also known to shed considerably more than most dogs, so you'll need to be a vigilant groomer. This dog is also known for its catlike behavior to clean itself after eating. In addition, this breed does not like hot weather, mostly because of its thick coat, so the owner of an Akita needs to be aware of when the dog may be overheated.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This breed has a relatively high energy level and should get between 30 and 60 minutes of exercise daily consisting of at least a brisk daily walk or two. But you may need to avoid walking an Akita at a dog park where his aggressive tendencies towards other dogs may be seen. An Akita may develop some destructive habits when bored or left alone too much.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Akita has a stiff, straight outer coat with a soft, thick undercoat. The breed sheds at a relatively high rate and will shed excessively about twice a year. Basic routine grooming is all that this breed tends to need for maintenance. Weekly brushing will keep the coat healthy and decrease shedding, and brushing should be done more frequently during peak shedding seasons.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Akitas are very smart dogs but are also known to be willful and stubborn. Proper obedience training and socialization can help you keep your Akita under control and allow the better personality traits to shine through. This makes training a challenge but also a necessity. In addition, early socialization is key. The Akita has a strong prey drive, is often hesitant around strangers, and may not always get along with other dogs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Akita puppies will grow rapidly and need a high-quality, low-calorie diet so they don't grow too fast. Adult Akitas should be fed twice a day with a total of three to five cups of dry food. Be sure to monitor your Akita for weight gain and discuss any special needs with your veterinarian.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Akita</h2><p>Before searching for an Akita, know that breeders and rescue groups will typically not release this breed into a home with young children. The Akita Club of America is a great place to start your search for a puppy. Their list of member breeders covers the U.S., Canada, and Spain. The best way to find an Akita rescue is to research local rescue groups; you may also get leads from the Akita Club of America Rescue and the Namaste Akita Rescue Alliance.</p><p>Akitas are considered a pricey breed, averaging between $700 to $1,600 for a puppy, but it can cost as much as $4,000 for a purebred offspring of competition-winning parents. If you are lucky enough to find an Akita that needs to be rehomed, you will pay considerably less in fees.</p><h2>Akita Overview</h2><p>Dignified</p><p>Courageous</p><p>Deeply loyal</p><p>Sheds profusely</p><p>Stubborn and may be difficult to train</p><p>Dominant and can be aggressive toward other dogs</p>",1051

Dobermans (also called ""Dobes"" or ""Dobies"") are fearless, loyal, and highly intelligent. These traits make them ideal police, war, and guard dogs, but they are also outstanding companions.</p><p>Well-trained Dobermans often do very great with children and in various social situations, and they can make great therapy dogs. The breed's temperament is generally known to be docile yet protective. The Doberman, which was first bred in Germany, has earned a reputation as a fierce guard dog (which it can certainly be). However, the breed is usually quite gentle and not aggressive by nature.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 24 to 28 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 65 to 100 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short and smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, red, blue, or fawn with rust markings (sometimes small patches of white are seen)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, loyal, alert, energetic, attentive</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Doberman Pinscher</h2><p>While they may have an intimidating appearance, Doberman Pinschers are a loveable, intelligent breed that is well-suited to a variety of different living situations. Dobermans are active and hardworking, and their reputation as guard dogs make them a great choice for families or owners who reside on large plots of land.</p><h2>History of the Doberman Pinscher</h2><p>The Doberman pinscher emerged as a breed in Germany around the turn of the 20th century. Karl Friedrich Louis Dobermann, for whom the breed was named, developed the breed out of the desire for a medium-sized companion and guard dog. In addition to being a tax collector, Dobermann operated the local dog pound and had access to a variety of dogs to use in his breeding program. It is believed that the Doberman originates from breeds such as the Rottweiler, black and tan terrier, German pinscher, and possibly the Greyhound.</p><p>The Doberman pinscher has been treasured for its great intelligence, loyalty, and athletic abilities. Over the years, the breed has diligently worked as a war dog and police dog but has also remained a faithful companion to many.</p><p>The breed is muscular and athletic, possessing great strength and endurance so much so that it historically served as the Marine Corps' official dog during World War II. Twenty-five Dobermans who died fighting with troops on Guam are honored on the World War II War Dog Memorial at the National War Dog Cemetery at Naval Base Guam.</p><p>Dobermans have traditionally had their tails docked (removed) soon after birth and later, their ears cropped (trimmed surgically in order to make them stand erect). Much controversy has surrounded the practice of ear cropping and tail docking in dogs, including the Doberman. Some countries have actually outlawed these practices, but while they are still permitted in the U.S., many people elect to keep the ears natural on their Dobermans.</p><h2>Doberman Pinscher Care</h2><p>Though many people think of Dobermans as serious dogs, they can actually be a bit goofy and rambunctious at times, especially as puppies. They will do well with children and enjoy playing together as long as the child is old enough to treat the dog with consideration. Still, they are also easily trained and have the drive to learn alongside their owner.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Most Dobermans have a fairly high energy level and require plenty of exercise in order to stay healthy. Because of their natural athleticism, a few brisk walks or runs every day will help keep a Doberman in tip-top shape. Your yard should be securely fenced, so your Doberman has room to roam and play; however, this breed can get chilled in cold weather, so don't leave him outside all the time. Your dog will want to be part of your family life rather than alone outside.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Doberman has a short, smooth hair coat that requires very little grooming. You can brush it once a week or give his coat a rub with a wet towel. You don't need to bathe the dog often, just when it gets dirty or develops an odor. If ears are kept natural (not cropped), then extra attention should be placed upon keeping the ears clean. Trim the dog's nails monthly to prevent them from splitting or tearing and brush the teeth at least a couple of times a week to help prevent gum disease and other dental problems.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Doberman is very smart and learns quite easily. Proper training is absolutely essential for this breed to ensure good behavior. Socialization is equally important so the dog isn't overly fearful or aggressive. It is best to keep the dog on a leash when you go for a walk Dobies can be aggressive towards other dogs that are not part of their family, and defensive if they think you are under threat. They may not be welcome at a dog park if they exhibit this behavior. As well, many people fear this breed and will be more comfortable around if the dog is on a leash.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in Dobermans.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Dobermans should be fed two meals each day, with as much as three and a half cups of dry dog food per day. The amount a dog needs will depend on size, activity level, age, and other factors. Having two smaller meals rather than one large meal can help prevent gas and bloating. This can become a medical emergency if the stomach twists to cut off the blood supply.</p><p>Be sure to monitor the dog's weight, as obesity can reduce your dog's lifespan and contribute to the risk of other health conditions. Discuss your dog's nutritional needs with your veterinarian to get recommendations specific for your pet.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Doberman Pinscher</h2><p>Doberman Pinschers can be found through breeders or via adoption throughout the U.S. Any breeders you inquire with should be able to answer any questions you have regarding the pedigree, health, and history of the litter and its parents. Ideally, you should meet one or both parents to have a better idea of your future pet's personality, size, and temperament. You can expect to pay between $1,000 and $2,500 to secure a Doberman Pinscher puppy from a breeder.</p><p>If you're looking for a Doberman, consider checking with local or regional rescue groups.</p><h2>Dog Breed Overview</h2><p>Fearless and athletic</p><p>Loyal</p><p>Highly intelligent</p><p>Can be aggressive towards other dogs</p><p>May seem intimidating (best kept on a leash in public)</p><p>Not ideal for a household with small children</p>",1076

This dog may resemble a mutt at first glance, but it's actually a purebred native to New Hampshire.</p><p>These unique dogs are typically friendly with anyone they meet. Along with its calm disposition, this breed is hardworking and trainable. If you're looking for an affectionate large breed, you'll love Chinooks. Their loyalty, natural athleticism, and intelligence make these dogs wonderful companions for a variety of owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 24 to 26 inches (males); 22 to 24 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 55 to 90 pounds (males); 50 to 65 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Smooth, medium-length fur</p><p>Coat Color: Fawn, red-gold, silver fawn, tawny, palomino, or gray-red; often with dark markings on eyes and muzzle</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, intelligent, loyal, calm, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Chinook</h2><p>Chinooks are as sharp as a tack, and they love opportunities for training and learning new skills. They'll gladly accompany you on a long walk or hike, and they'll be even happier to snooze on the couch afterward. Since Chinooks have a playful temperament, they're a great choice for families (though as a large breed, their interactions with young children should be supervised).</p><p>These dogs undoubtedly love their packs. Chinooks are not suitable for homes where they are alone for long periods of time, as they're happiest when getting plenty of attention from their owners. Great with kids, other pets, and strangers, they have laid-back and sensible personalities that work well in social households.<br/></p><h2>History of the Chinook</h2><p>The Chinook is the state dog of New Hampshire, and the breed was founded by the state's own Arthur Walden in the early 1900s. As an adventurer, Walden made his way to Alaska at the height of the Gold Rush in 1896 and began driving sled dogs.</p><p>Upon his return home to New Hampshire, Walden brought his newfound passion with him. He decided to breed his own line of powerful sled-pulling puppies. Walden started by breeding a Mastiff-type dog with a Husky, and he named the resulting breed after the lead dog on his sled team, Chinook. All Chinook individuals can be traced back to these dogs.</p><p>After Walden died in 1947, the Chinook breed suffered. The population dwindled (reaching near extinction), and the Chinook was named the rarest dog breed by Guinness World Records 20 years later. Chinook enthusiasts around the world took on the responsibility of bringing this unique breed back. Subsequently, the Chinook was accepted by the American Kennel Club in 2013 as part of the Working Group.<br/></p><h2>Chinook Care</h2><p>Chinooks need a moderate amount of exercise, but they do not require as much activity as many other working breeds. This breed is highly trainable and eager to please its owners. When it comes to grooming, Chinooks are known for their tendency to shed heavily, so prospective owners should be prepared for regular brushings to reduce stray hair around the house.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Vigorous exercise does not need to be the top priority of a Chinook owner. These dogs only need regular walks and playtime totaling about an hour daily. Chinooks make great partners for hikes, runs, bike rides, or swimming, and they're also content to play in the backyard. They were bred to be sled dogs, but that doesn't mean they do well when left outdoors. Chinooks are hardy dogs that love to be near their people at all times. Your dog will likely stay by your side as often as possible.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Chinooks have double coats to keep them warm in cold climates, and they also shed heavily twice per year. During these seasons, daily brushing and occasional de-shedding baths can keep stray fur under control. Brushing a few times each week is sufficient throughout the rest of the year.</p><p>Bathe your Chinook on an as-needed basis when you notice the dog's fur becoming dirty or after long play sessions outdoors. This breed's coat does not need to be trimmed, but owners should keep up with regular grooming care like teeth brushing, nail clipping, and ear cleaning to maintain their dog's health.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Chinook is a determined and intelligent breed that responds well to training. A few basic obedience lessons can begin when puppies are six to eight weeks old, but this breed also excels at advanced training as it grows older. Housetraining and learning good behavior is usually a breeze for these smart, devoted dogs.</p><p>It's best to use positive reinforcement training and avoid any methods that involve punishment. This sensitive breed is likely to become fearful if yelled at. By rewarding your Chinook for performing desired actions, you'll build a strong bond and encourage your dog's natural instinct to please you by obeying commands.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like many purebred dogs, Chinooks are susceptible to developing a few inherited health conditions. Responsible breeders strive to maintain high standards by testing their dogs for genetic problems before breeding. Always ask your breeder to provide your new puppy's medical history. If you're rescuing a dog from a shelter, ask for any previous veterinary records to help keep your new best friend healthy in the future.</p><h2> Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Chinook a diet of high-quality dog food twice per day, either commercial or home-prepared under your veterinarian's supervision. If your dog exercises frequently, it will likely require larger portions to stay healthy.</p><p>Some owners opt to feed these dogs smaller portions several times per day to help prevent Bloat but most importantly, you should talk to your veterinarian to determine the healthiest diet and portion plan for your specific dog based on its age, weight, and activity level. Fresh water should also be available at all times (especially for very active Chinooks).</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Chinook</h2><p>Before you bring home a Chinook, review reputable breeders and rescues to find a healthy, happy pup. Chinooks are still a rare breed, so it's not always easy to find these dogs in local shelters. However, breed-specific rescues exist to help Chinooks in need. Your local shelter can also introduce you to similar dogs waiting for their forever homes.</p><p>If you plan to adopt a puppy from a breeder, start by researching responsible breeders in your region. You should see the litter's medical history, be allowed to meet their parents, and be able to see that the dogs are raised in a comfortable, safe indoor location. Chinooks from breeders typically cost around $1,000 to $2,500, but prices can vary based on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Chinook Overview</h2><p>Loyal and affectionate</p><p>Easy to train</p><p>Kid- and pet-friendly</p><p>High shedding level</p><p>Shouldn't be left alone often</p><p>Rare breed; can be hard to find</p>",1101

There are smooth and rough coat varieties, with the smooth coat being close to the body and the rough coat being denser and longer around the neck and legs.</p><p>Saint Bernards are known as gentle giants. They are incredibly loyal to and loving with their family. And their general love of people, eagerness to please, and determination to work have made them proficient search-and-rescue and service dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 26 to 28 inches (female), 28 to 30 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 120 to 140 pounds (female), 140 to 180 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Short to medium-length, smooth or rough double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Brindle and white, brown and white, mahogany and white, orange and white, red and white, or rust and white with/without a black mask</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 10 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Gentle, affectionate, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Switzerland</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Large and Lovable Saint Bernard</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Saint Bernard</h2><p>Saint Bernards generally have a calm and affectionate temperament. And their love of kids is a hallmark of their personality. Despite their large size, they're only moderately energetic and don't need an excessive amount of exercise.</p><h2>History of the Saint Bernard</h2><p>The Saint Bernard is a legendary hero of the Swiss Alps. It dates back more than 1,000 years, though its exact origin is uncertain. Some sources suggest that Saints emerged from mixes between native Swiss dogs and large Asian dogs that Roman armies brought to Switzerland (perhaps the Tibetan mastiff or a similar dog).</p><p>The breed was named for Archdeacon Bernard de Menthon, who founded a hospice in the Swiss Alps as a refuge for travelers. For centuries, monks developed the dogs as companions, watchdogs, and workers that rescued lost and injured travelers in the Swiss Alps. Their highly developed sense of smell allows them to track people in the snow.</p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1885, and it's become fairly popular in North America. Saint Bernards have been featured in pop culture, including the ""Beethoven"" movies and the Stephen King novel ""Cujo.""<br/></p><h2>Saint Bernard Care</h2><p>Plan to exercise your Saint Bernard every day to keep it happy and healthy, and keep up with regular grooming. Likewise, consistent training and socialization are key for a well-adjusted dog. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While Saint Bernards are generally easy-going, daily physical activity and mental stimulation are still important for their health and well-being. Aim for at least an hour of exercise per day via walks, hiking, and vigorous play sessions. Also, dog sports and even search-and rescue or other assistance dog classes can be a good way to burn mental and physical energy. Many owners also get their Saint Bernards involved as therapy dogs.</p><p>Be aware that Saint Bernards don't tolerate hot weather well. So keep outdoor exercise sessions short in the heat. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>You can care for both the rough and smooth Saint Bernard coat types in the same manner. Brush at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Periods of higher shedding will typically occur in the spring and fall as the weather changes. During this time, you might have to brush daily to keep up with all the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your dog roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. But check its ears weekly to see whether they need cleaning from wax buildup, debris, and other abnormalities. Check its nails about every month to see whether they need a trim. And aim to brush your Saint Bernard's teeth every day. </p><p>Furthermore, Saint Bernards are a very drool-prone dog breed. Expect to keep a towel handy for daily drool cleanup around your dog's face, as well as on furniture, the floor, and other areas where your dog's slobber might reach.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your Saint Bernard from as young of an age as possible. It's key that these dogs learn their manners especially not to jump on people, pull on leashes, or steal items from tables and counters before they reach their full size. </p><p>Saint Bernards generally are eager to please and take to training well. Always use positive training methods, as they can be sensitive to harsh corrections. And be consistent in your commands. In addition, make sure to expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations from an early age to boost its comfort and confidence. </p><p>Some Saint Bernards are prone to separation anxiety, as the breed likes to be with its family as much as possible. Work on teaching your dog to be comfortable when you leave the house. Otherwise, destructive behaviors, such as unwanted chewing, can occur. If your dog will be left alone frequently, a Saint Bernard might not be the breed for you. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible to your dog. And select a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. One that's made specifically for large breeds is ideal for a Saint Bernard. It's typical to feed measured meals to ensure that your dog is receiving the correct calorie consumption. And you should always run both the type of food and the amount by your vet. </p><p>Like other deep-chested dog breeds, Saint Bernards are prone to bloat and stomach twisting. This can be a life-threatening condition and often is the result of eating too quickly. Splitting your dog's daily food allotment into smaller, more frequent meals and restricting exercise around mealtimes can help to prevent bloat. Make sure to ask your vet about these prevention methods, the signs of bloat, and what to do if you suspect your dog has it.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Saint Bernard</h2><p>The Saint Bernard is a moderately popular dog breed. So it's worth checking local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $3,000, though this can vary widely depending on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Saint Bernard Overview</h2><p>Gentle and affectionate</p><p>Eager to please</p><p>Typically good with kids</p><p>Drools a lot</p><p>Has a relatively short lifespan</p><p>Requires training to prevent jumping and leash pulling</p>",1024

It is known for its muscular body, thick hindquarters, and easy trot. Descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions, the Rottie can be a gentle playmate and companion, despite its reputation for being dangerous. The breed is a bit aloof but also very intelligent, protective, and loyal to its family. The Rottie can be an excellent working dog, watchdog, or guard dog, too. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 22 to 27 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 80 to 130 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black with tan, rust, or mahogany</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 10 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Steady, alert, self-assured, fearless, devoted, confident, good-natured, obedient</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Rottweiler</h2><p>The Rottweiler is intensely loyal and protective of trusted family members. This breed also has a playful and affectionate side that it reveals when at ease. Few Rotties have an aggressive nature, despite what some people think. They are usually very calm, loyal, and loving companions to those they trust. However, they may be suspicious of strangers due to their protective nature.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Protective and Loyal Rottweiler</h3><h2>History of the Rottweiler</h2><p>Though the exact origins of the Rottweiler are not known, it is believed that the breed derived from the mastiff and that its ancestors can be traced back to ancient Rome. They were drover dogs who herded livestock for the army. Later development of the breed occurred in the German town of Rottweil, where it worked as a cattle dog and sometimes a police dog before its popularity diminished. At one time, the breed was referred to as the Rottweiler metzgerhund, which roughly means butcher's dog of Rottweil.</p><p>In the early 20th century, the breed was once again used as a police dog and began gaining popularity in the U.S. The hard-working nature of the Rottweiler has made its popularity grow over the years and it is now the eighth most popular breed, according to the American Kennel Club (AKC). The breed was recognized by the AKC in 1931.<br/></p><h2>Rottweiler Care</h2><p>Rotties can be excellent companions for all kinds of families, including those with children (provided you train your dog to behave around kids and also teach your kids how to safely interact with dogs). The Rottweiler has a drive to work, high endurance, a commanding presence, and potential for territorial behavior. Many Rotties will benefit from some type of ""job,"" such as guarding the home, obedience competition, or tracking.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Ideally, a Rottie should get vigorous exercise including walks and playtime for at least two hours a day. A Rottweiler loves to have fun with its human companion so engage in games of hide-and-seek, fetching, and tugging. Just beware that since this breed may be aggressive towards new dogs, your Rottweiler may not be welcome at the dog park.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Rottie's short, somewhat coarse, but shiny hair coat has a moderate shedding rate and requires little more than basic grooming care. Use a curry brush or similar tool to brush your Rottie periodically and keep the coat healthy. Expect heavier shedding in the spring and fall.</p><p>Some Rotties will naturally wear down their nails, but it is important that you inspect them regularly and trim the nails as needed. This will keep your dog's feet healthy and comfortable.</p><p>Good oral hygiene will benefit your pet. Brush your dog's teeth daily or at least two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>It is essential that all Rotties be put on a strict training program to best utilize their intelligence and energy, keeping them happy, healthy, and safe. In addition, proper socialization is imperative and will help your Rottie feel comfortable in many situations. Playing rough with a Rottie could encourage any aggressive tendencies.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible dog breeders work hard to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health problems. However, there are some hereditary health issues that may occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed a Rottweiler two meals of 2 to 5 cups of dry food per day. The amount depends on the dog's size, activity level, age, and other factors. Free-feeding isn't recommended because Rottweilers are not good at self-moderation and will tend to put on weight if allowed to eat whenever they want. Obesity will shorten your dog's lifespan, so discuss this with your veterinarian to get a recommended feeding schedule, amount, type of food, and exercise plan.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Rottweiler</h2><p>If you think you are ready to have a Rottweiler, it's important to do more research first. Get opinions from veterinarians and pet professionals, and ask Rottie owners, responsible breeders, and rescue groups for more information.</p><p>No matter the breed, if you adopt a dog, discuss temperament testing (rescue groups and shelters usually do this before putting pets up for adoption). If you are buying from a breeder, ask about the line's temperament history and meet the puppy's mother (and father if possible). Behavior traits can be inherited, but good breeders breed for good temperament. Sadly, some irresponsible breeders will purposely breed dogs for aggression.</p><p>The American Rottweiler Club is a great place to start your search for a Rottie. The club's breeder referral coordinator can connect you with a member breeder.</p><p>The Rottweiler Rescue Foundation supports rescue groups throughout the U.S. and lists their contact information so you can research adoptable dogs by region. Remember to check the laws of your jurisdiction if you want to adopt a Rottweiler.</p><p>You can pay several hundred dollars to adopt or rescue a Rottweiler, but expect to pay a breeder between $850 to $3,500 or even more for a Rottie puppy depending on bloodlines and certain other characteristics.</p><h2>Rottweiler Overview</h2><p>Intelligent</p><p>Loyal and protective</p><p>Courageous and athletic</p><p>Tendency to herd children may interfere with family harmony</p><p>Commanding presence that may intimidate people or other animals</p><p>Strong prey drive may make them incompatible with other pets in the house</p>",981

Since these dogs don't shed significantly, they're a preferred breed among people with mild to moderate allergies. Portuguese water dogs are also a high-energy breed, so they're best suited for active owners seeking a companion for outdoor activities.</p><p>Portuguese water dogs are workers that pick up training and obedience skills quickly, which also makes them a common choice to be service animals. While they're popular for their easily trainable nature and intelligence, these dogs are also friendly and loving family pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Portuguese Water Dog</h2><p>The Portuguese water dog was bred to work with fishermen, and the breed still carries its historical water-loving personality to this day. Your Portie will thrive when exercised regularly, especially when it comes to swimming, and when it's spending time with you. Overall, these dogs have a friendly temperament and enjoy being close to their owners. They also get along very well with kids and other pets, and they're always eager to play. Porties do have an independent streak, but with proper amounts of exercise and training, they can be perfectly well-behaved dogs who strive to please.</p><h2>History of the Portuguese Water Dog</h2><p>The Portuguese water dog is an ancient breed; the first written description of these dogs appeared in an account written by a monk in 1297. Porties are close relatives of another ancient breed, the poodle. It's thought that modern Portuguese water dogs and poodles developed from the same genetic pool, with distinct historical paths separating the breeds in terms of personality, appearance, and temperament.</p><p>Portuguese water dogs became close companions of humans early on thanks to their predisposition to life on the sea. They worked closely alongside Portuguese fishermen, swimming between boats to retrieve lost tackle and herd fish into nets. The ""founding sire"" of modern Portuguese water dogs was a dog named Leão owned by Vasco Bensaude, a wealthy Portuguese businessman in the 1930s. It's believed that more than half of all Portuguese water dogs' lineages can be traced back to Leão.</p><p>Porties were popularized in the U.S. in the early 1970s with the creation of the Portuguese Water Dog Club of America. While they're still known for loving water, the dogs are revered today mostly for their friendliness as pets and their show-worthy qualities.</p><p>Although the breed was first recorded by a monk in the late 13th century, Portuguese water dogs have become particularly well-known in the past few decades. This is thanks to former U.S. President Barack Obama and his family, who had two Portuguese Water Dogs Bo and Sunny during their time in the White House.<br/></p><h2>Portuguese Water Dog Care</h2><p>The Portuguese water dog can be an incredible companion, but it's important for prospective owners to prepare for its care needs. These dogs require considerable amounts of exercise and grooming, but thanks to their intelligence, they are usually very trainable and eager to please.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Porties are high-energy working dogs that require regular exercise to stave off boredom. In addition to regular walks and plenty of swims when possible, Portuguese water dogs thrive in training-based activities like agility, nose work, dock diving, therapy work, and obedience. About an hour of exercise per day, coupled with playtime and brain-boosting activities, is recommended to keep Portuguese water dogs at their best both mentally and physically.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>While the Portuguese Water Dog is a low-shedding breed, it still needs regular and often extensive grooming. Porties should be brushed two to three times a week and trimmed once a month to keep their fur from becoming tangled or matted. For Portuguese water dogs that spend a lot of time swimming, extra care should be taken to ensure their skin, coat, and ears are properly cleaned to prevent infection or inflammation from salt or chemicals in pools. Like all breeds, it's also important to trim your dog's nails and brush its teeth regularly to prevent dental disease.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>In terms of training, most Portuguese Water Dogs love to learn and adapt quickly to new skills through the use of positive reinforcement. Basic obedience lessons can begin as early as eight weeks of age. Training Porties is a great way to build up their bond with their humans, and it can help mitigate behavioral problems caused by boredom (like becoming destructive around the house). Because they're such fast learners, Portuguese water dogs make exceptional therapy and service dogs and often excel at competitive canine sports.</p><p>Those who are interested in having their Portie begin therapy dog training should take note of their individual dog's unique personality traits. Work closely with a reputable therapy dog training organization to ensure the dog is suitable and effectively trained for the role.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like most purebred dogs, Portuguese water dogs are susceptible to certain genetic health problems. Responsible breeders can test their dogs for many of these issues and avoid breeding dogs that may pass genetic problems on to puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Portuguese water dogs do best on a high-protein, high-quality diet optimized to suit their individual needs. Because of their elevated activity levels, many Porties may need a higher caloric intake than other dogs, though exact caloric needs should be determined based on discussions between owners and their veterinarians.</p><p>Feed this breed twice a day instead of leaving food out for grazing, which will help establish a routine and discourage overeating. If your dog becomes overweight, it can be more likely to develop medical problems like hip dysplasia. Talk with your vet to create a healthy meal plan based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Portuguese Water Dog</h2><p>To find a Portuguese water dog, check your local shelters and rescue groups. Similar breeds can also make a great addition to your family, and many are in shelters waiting for their forever homes.</p><p>If you're planning to adopt a puppy, ensure your breeder provides any relevant medical tests for the litter's parents and allows you to see the conditions in which their dogs are kept. These dogs can cost anywhere from $1,500 to $3,000 from a breeder, though prices may vary depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h2>Portuguese Water Dog Overview</h2><p>Does not shed significantly</p><p>Gets along well with other pets</p><p>Intelligent and responds quickly to training</p><p>Needs regular brushing and grooming</p><p>Requires more exercise than other less-athletic breeds</p><p>Potentially destructive when not exercised or entertained enough</p>",1061

Havanese dogs have playful, affectionate personalities. Their good-natured temperament and intelligence make them great family dogs. The breed dates back to the 1500s and is a popular choice for learning tricks, performing in dog sports, and showing in competitions. The clever Havanese is also known to make up its own games and train its owners to play them. They may also be used as visiting therapy dogs, especially those that are well-socialized to not be timid with strangers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 8.5 to 11.5 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 13 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double coat that is long, silky, and straight or wavy with ringlets</p><p>Coat Color: One or two colors including black, silver, white, cream, tan, fawn, gold, sable, or red</p><p>Life Span: 14 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, playful, bright, even-tempered, companionable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Cuba</p><h2>Characteristics of the Havanese</h2><p>If you want a small dog with a relatively easygoing temperament, the Havanese might be right for you. These dogs tend to be great with children and other pets. The friendly and gentle personality of the Havanese makes them suitable for many types of homes, including apartments. They're also a great choice for travel and RV living as they are small and do not bark much.</p><p>It's best to adopt this breed if you have plenty of time to spend with your dog. A Havanese will not do well if left alone for long periods of time. These dogs crave companionship, and they're known to develop separation anxiety or destructive habits when lonely and bored.<br/></p><h2>History of the Havanese</h2><p>The Havanese is the national dog of Cuba. This old, native breed was developed when its canine ancestors came to Cuba from Spain in the early 1500s by way of Tenerife in the Canary Islands the ""islands of the dogs."" The breed is believed to share lineage with the bichon. The Havanese was a beloved pet of Cuban aristocrats, and it later became popular among prominent Europeans including Queen Victoria and Charles Dickens. This purebred dog is rare to find in Cuba now, as the island is overrun with mixed-breed strays.</p><p>The Havanese has been in the U.S. since the Cuban revolution in 1959 when only 11 dogs were left to save the breed from extinction. It has thrived in the U.S. and Europe, and the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1996.</p><h2>Havanese Care</h2><p>Your Havanese will require more time in the grooming department than short-haired dogs, but its low exercise needs help to balance out its care requirements. This breed is intelligent and tends to learn basic obedience easily, as well as special tricks and dog sports when desired.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As a moderately active little dog, the Havanese should get daily exercise, but this breed does not need more than about half an hour per day. Routine walks and playing inside the house are usually enough to keep the Havanese happy and healthy. With the proper outlets for their energy, these dogs are content to cuddle on your lap when they're not playing, making them great companions for apartment living.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because of its silky coat type, routine grooming is an absolute necessity for the Havanese. Brush your dog often at least once or twice per week. Your Havanese will need brushing more often if its coat is kept long. If you don't have the time to provide regular brush sessions, this breed may not be right for you.</p><p>Many Havanese owners choose to keep a shorter coat, in which case haircuts may be necessary every few weeks. Their coat protects them from the sun, and they do well in hot weather. It's best to keep the coat longer in the winter, as they can tolerate cold weather moderately.</p><p>Despite its silky fur, the Havanese does not shed much. It's considered a hypoallergenic dog because of its low-shedding coat, though it may be less suitable for those with allergies than breeds like poodle mixes.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like all dogs, the Havanese should receive basic training. These dogs are intelligent and attentive, therefore they tend to learn quickly. General training will contribute to your dog's overall happiness and help it become a well-mannered member of the family.</p><p>One drawback is that the Havanese can take a while to housebreak. You will need to be consistent during this period or provide a doggy door to give constant access to the outdoors. Many of these dogs don't like to get wet, so it's helpful to have a covered area available. On the other hand, if your dog grows up around water, it can be a good swimmer but in general, the Havanese should be an indoor pet.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can still occur in the Havanese breed.</p><p>The following are some conditions to be aware of: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Havanese two meals a day with a total of one-half to one cup of dry dog food. Don't leave out food for free-feeding; this can quickly lead to weight gain. Canine obesity can reduce a dog's lifespan and lead to other health conditions. Discuss any weight gain with your veterinarian, and determine both feeding and exercise schedules based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level.</p><p>Avoid giving human food to your Havanese. Be aware that they are tricksters, and they're known to ""train"" their owners to share food. It's important to be consistent and ensure everyone in your family knows that the Havanese should only eat dog food.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Havanese</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and rescue groups for Havanese dogs in need of homes. There are a number of nationwide rescue groups for this breed, as well as responsible breeders for those set on adopting a puppy.</p><p>These dogs typically cost between $1,000 and $1,500 from breeders, though some prices can be upwards of $2,500 depending on the dog's pedigree and availability in your area. Always research local breeders to ensure you adopt from one that provides comfortable living conditions for their dogs and shares their medical history.</p><h2>Havanese Overview</h2><p>Low shedding</p><p>Gentle and cheerful</p><p>Gets along well with children and other dogs</p><p>Housebreaking can take time</p><p>Shouldn't be left alone for long periods</p><p>High-maintenance grooming</p>",1049

Independent and reserved with strangers, these dogs are sensitive and affectionate with their owners.</p><h2>History of the Manchester Terrier</h2><p>Before Manchester became associated with soccer, it was actually the epicenter of England's textile trade. In the mid-1800s, local mill workers had two favorite pastimes teaming up with small hounds to hunt rabbits, and rat killing, which involved sending a terrier into a rat pit and then betting on the results. As such, breeders of the time wanted to create a dog that would excel at both ""sports"" by crossing a ""ratter"" dog known as the black and tan terrier with whippets. That's when the distinctive Manchester terrier was born.</p><p>The black and tan terrier was one of the most popular and accomplished terriers in England, and there are records of these dogs as far back as the 16th century. The breed was known to be a skilled dispatcher of rats. Industrialization brought about the advent of sport within the working class, such as rat-catching with black and tans and dog racing with whippets high on the list of popular activities. The crossing of the two breeds resulted in a refined terrier breed with a slightly arched back, and in 1860, the breed was formally called the Manchester terrier.</p><p>It ended up that there were two Manchester breeds that developed over time the standard Manchester terrier and toy Manchester terrier were registered as separate breeds until the end of the 1950s. The development of the toy breed from the larger standard breed occurred first as a matter of chance, and then later as a result of selective breeding. Since that time, the two breeds have blended to form one breed known as the Manchester terrier, although they are still considered to be two varieties (and the American Kennel Club has grouped them separately). The standard Manchester is a member of the terrier group and the toy Manchester is considered a toy breed.</p><h2>Manchester Terrier Care</h2><p>Manchester terriers are very responsive and cooperative, and they make for playful and well-mannered pets that are devoted to their families. They should be properly socialized and ideally introduced to other family pets as puppies, as they are not only wary of strangers but also not always particularly friendly with other dogs. But watch these natural hunters around other small animals in the household, such as rabbits or smaller furry pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Manchester is a moderately active and highly athletic breed requiring a significant amount of daily exercise in the form of leashed walks as well as playtime in a fenced-in backyard. Plan on giving your dog at least a full hour a day of physical activity. Potential Manchester owners should know that this is a ""busy"" breed, and it will always be looking around for games and entertainment. Since it's a terrier, it will also have a penchant for digging.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Manchester terrier is considered a low-maintenance breed when it comes to grooming. This dog will only require an occasional bath and possibly a weekly wipe down with a damp towel or glove to keep its short, tight coat clean and shiny. As with all breeds, regular nail trimming, ear cleaning, and teeth brushing are also a necessity to keep the Manchester terrier looking and feeling its best.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed is considered to be highly intelligent, and they appear to be able to think and plan their way through various situations. They are people-pleasers, love a challenge, and can be easily trained with the help of positive reinforcement and reward-based techniques.</p><p>The Manchester terrier will not respond well to harsh corrections, and training sessions should be kept fun and full of praise. Not surprisingly, this breed performs well in an array of dog sports, including agility, obedience training, tracking, flyball, and scent work.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Manchester terrier is generally a healthy dog, but all purebred dogs may be susceptible to genetic conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Manchester terrier should perform well with a high-quality commercially or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times. As with all breeds, treats should be given in moderation and the dog's diet should be controlled in order to avoid weight gain or obesity-related issues.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Manchester Terrier</h2><p>Manchester terriers are considered a rare breed, so it may be difficult to find one to adopt or buy from a breeder. Be sure to check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for Manchester terriers that are in need of a forever home. National rescue organizations such as the American Manchester Terrier Club can be a helpful source of information to help you find your new best friend. You can also check in with the AKC Marketplace to see if any breeders have available puppies. If you choose to work with a breeder, expect to pay between $1,200 to $1,500 for a puppy.</p><h2>Manchester Terrier Overview</h2><p>Requires minimal grooming</p><p>Great with families</p><p>People-pleaser and easy to train</p><p>Can be reserved with strangers</p><p>High-energy and needs ample exercise</p><p>Rare breed</p>",973

They are the smallest of the four Swiss mountain dogs, with stocky legs, a tri-colored coat, and a friendly face that has earned them their unique nickname: , which means ""laughing dog."" Entlebucher mountain dogs are hard-working and enthusiastic companions that easily form close bonds with their owners or families.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 16 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 50 to 65 pounds (male), 40 to 55 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat: Short, dense, and coarse</p><p>Coat Color: Tri-colored (brown, black, and white)</p><p>Life Span: 11 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, confident, energetic, companionable, loyal, independent</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Switzerland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Entlebucher Mountain Dog</h2><p>Despite their smaller size, these herding dogs are extremely tough, sturdy, and energetic, making them a good pick for active families with older kids. Because Entles were bred as herding dogs, they're very protective of their people. Although they're loyal and loving to their families, Entles can be wary of strangers, so it's important to begin socializing your Entle with strangers and other animals as early as possible.<br/></p><h2>History of the Entlebucher Mountain Dog</h2><p>Entles belong to a group of Swiss mountain dogs collectively known as Sennehund, which translates to ""the herdsman's dog."" Of the four breeds which also include the Bernese mountain dog, the Appenzeller, and the Greater Swiss mountain dog the Entlebucher is the smallest.</p><p>All four dogs are descendants of a large, Mastiff-like dog that was bred by the Romans over 2,000 years ago. While the Bernese mountain dog and Greater Swiss mountain dog were originally used to protect livestock, the Appenzeller and Entlebucher mountain dog were used to drive cattle. Their smaller, more-compact sizes and endless energy enabled them to run behind livestock for hours.</p><p>The first description of a dog from the Entlebuch valley is dated 1889. This description, however, combines the Entlebucher and Appenzeller into one breed; it wasn't until 1913 that the four breeds were given their distinctions.</p><p>Unfortunately, crossbreeding with German shepherds during the 1900s (and the outbreak of World War I) nearly wiped out the Entlebucher breed. A single Entlebucher couldn't be found in Europe in the years following the war.</p><p>Thanks to the efforts of several dedicated breeders, breed standards were developed and an Entlebucher club was formed in 1926. These breeders were able to locate 17 Entlebuchers to revitalize the breed, and they were officially recognized as a member of the Herding Group by the American Kennel Club in 2009.</p><h2>Entlebucher Mountain Dog Care</h2><p>Entlebuchers have gained a reputation as a high-maintenance breed, so they might not be the ideal dogs for everyone. They require several hours of exercise each day and can be stubborn, making training a challenge. They're a highly intelligent breed that can become bored and rambunctious easily. Still, for the right family, they're more than worth the effort and will repay you with love and endless affection.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Entles require both physical and mental stimulation to be satisfied. In addition to running, playing fetch, swimming, or hiking, you can release some of your Entle's energy with agility courses, obedience challenges, or puzzles designed for dogs.</p><p>If you're playing with your Entle outside, make sure it's in an enclosed area their innate herding drive may make them chase (and attempt to herd) other animals or even kids.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Entlebucher mountain dogs should be brushed two to three times a week, and more frequently during shedding seasons. Weekly brushing will help keep your dog's coat shiny, healthy, and free of dirt and debris. Depending on how often you brush your Entle, you can expect to bathe it every four weeks. In general, the more often you brush your dog, the less frequently it will need a bath.</p><p>Like many breeds, the Entlebucher can be susceptible to periodontal disease if proper dental hygiene isn't maintained. Daily brushing is ideal, but brushing your Entle's teeth at least once a week can offer protection against tooth and gum disease.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Obedience training and early socialization are musts for Entles. Because Entlebuchers are highly intelligent, they can have a mind of their own. Their independence and stubbornness may be frustrating for first-time dog owners, and it can be especially challenging when you're trying to train your dog.</p><p>Additionally, Entles can be aggressive towards strangers and other dogs, so it's important to socialize your dog as early as possible. The more you expose your pup to unfamiliar people and animals at an early age, the calmer and more accepting it will be when meeting new faces throughout its life.</p><p>DarmstadtKoeln / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although the Entlebucher mountain dog is a generally healthy breed, it may be susceptible to certain health conditions. There's no guarantee that your dog will (or won't) develop these or other health problems, so talk to your vet about simple steps you can take to ensure a long, happy, healthy life for your dog.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your dog's diet depends largely on its age, activity level, and metabolism. Because Entlebucher mountain dogs are extremely active, they should be fed high-quality, high-protein dog food. If you're not sure how much or how frequently to feed your dog, talk to your veterinarian about finding the right diet for their needs.</p><p>Overfeeding your dog or giving them too many treats can lead to a whole host of health issues, like canine obesity, heart disease, or diabetes. Follow the feeding guide provided by your favorite dog food brand or listen to the advice given to you by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Entlebucher Mountain Dog</h2><p>If you choose to purchase an Entlebucher from a breeder, it's vital to do your research and ensure it's an ethical, reputable, and moral breeding operation. If possible, visit the breeding location and ask to meet the litter's parents. Look out for signs of backyard breeding, like unhealthy dogs, unsanitary conditions at the breeding site, or very frequent litters.</p><h2>Entlebucher Mountain Dog Overview</h2><p>Very loving and loyal to family members</p><p>Extremely active and loves to run or hike</p><p>Lower maintenance grooming needs</p><p>Can be aggressive with strangers or other dogs</p><p>Very stubborn and independent, which can make training a challenge</p><p>Has a high tendency to bark</p>",1017

It has a short tricolored coat typically dominated by white and varied shades of brown. Beagles are scent hounds, hunting and tracking their prey by ground-scenting, and their keen sense of smell ranks with bloodhounds and basset hounds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 15 inches or less in height at the shoulder, with two varieties: those under 13 inches and those from 13 to 15 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 20 to 25 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short</p><p>COAT COLOR: Tricolor combinations can include tan, black, white, reddish brown, and pale lemon</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Active, companionable, keen, attentive, fearless</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Beagle</h2><p>Beagles are energetic, carefree, and optimistic dogs, and they are considered one of the most popular breeds for active households. They can be wonderful companions and great family dogs when properly trained and socialized. Having been bred to be in packs, they also get along well with other dogs, and most do well with cats, especially if raised together.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Carefree but Stubborn Beagle</h3><h2>History of the Beagle</h2><p>The breed was originally bred in 16th-century England as rabbit-hunting hounds. Beagles can be traced back to 16th-century England, where wealthy Englishmen often owned packs of hounds. The smaller hounds were the beagles, which were used in hunting rabbits and other small prey. They were also used as gun dogs, flushing game for hunters.</p><p>Over time, the breed was developed in England and, later, in North America. Beagles became more refined and widely recognized in North America by the late 19th century, eventually becoming one of the most popular breeds. Though still used in packs for hunting today, beagles are more commonly seen as companion and family dogs. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885.</p><p>Snoopy from the cartoons is a beagle, reflecting the breed's popularity at the time Charles Schulz began to draw the comic strip in 1950. President Lyndon B. Johnson owned several beagles while in the White House. Today, beagles are used by the United States Department of Agriculture for detecting contraband food items in luggage.</p><h2>Beagle Care</h2><p>These fearless hounds are well-suited to both hunting and companionship, but they need adequate daily exercise, regular grooming, and proper training. They require human companionship or the companionship of other pets throughout the day. Because beagles get along with other dogs, freestyle running in a properly enclosed dog park can be fun exercise for both of you. Beagles instinctively will bay and bark when they detect an interesting scent, but they may also become problem barkers due to boredom or separation anxiety, and training may help.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Though they may sometimes act lazy on the surface, beagles have loads of energy and need regular exercise to use it up, even more so than other dogs. Otherwise, the dog may release that mischievous nature inside. Walk your dog once or twice daily and give it plenty of chances to run and play to result in at least a full hour of exercise a day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Beagles have short, water-resistant coats with a moderate to high rate of shedding. Routine basic grooming is all that is typically necessary to keep beagles looking their best. Luckily, their coat doesn't pick up much debris, so you won't need frequent baths or cleaning up what your dog tracks into the house.</p><p>Be sure to keep their floppy ears clean to prevent ear infections. Also, remember to trim the dog's nails regularly to prevent overgrowth, which can affect the gait. It is also good to brush your dog's teeth at least a couple of times per week to maintain good oral health.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>As scent hounds, they enjoy sniffing everything along your walks, which will exercise your dog's mind as well as his body. However, you will need good leash control and training, so you can control your dog if he gets a scent that he wants to track.</p><p>Without proper obedience training, beagles can be become unruly and defiant due to their strong-willed nature. They are notoriously difficult to train and command, and you have to make it fun and interesting for your dog to pay attention to your wishes.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur within any breed. In general, beagles are usually healthy dogs. However, they can still develop health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Beagles love to eat and are notorious for detecting, raiding, and eating anything they can find. You should provide two meals a day of up to 3/4 cup of dry dog food per meal. The amount will vary by the dog's size, age, activity level, and other factors. Keep the dog food and your human food well-secured against this hungry canine. Because of their omnivorous appetites, you will have to monitor your dog's weight and take action if you see it is becoming overweight. Discuss your dog's needs with your veterinarian to get recommendations for the right food, feeding schedule, and amount.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Beagle</h2><p>Before adopting or buying a beagle, remember this dog needs a family that can genuinely and consistently offer it a lot of time and attention. Check your local animal shelter to see if there's a beagle in need of a home.</p><p>The National Beagle Club of America also lists breeders on its website, though the group does not endorse or guarantee any organization or person.</p><h2>Beagle Overview</h2><p>Great family pets</p><p>Gets along with other animals</p><p>Won't need much grooming</p><p>Loves to dig</p><p>Loud, howling bark</p><p>Sheds regularly</p><p>Can be hard to train</p>",946

It is known for its alert expression, strong and agile body, ready-to-go attitude, and strong instincts. The breed descends from the sheepdogs of the British Isles and is named after the border between England and Scotland. A hugely popular breed, border collies can make excellent companions for very active households. Overall, this is a much-loved and celebrated dog breed that bonds closely with fully engaged human companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 18 to 22 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 28 to 48 pounds</p><p>COAT: Rough or smooth medium-length double coat with a coarse outer coat and soft undercoat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid color, bicolor, tricolor, merle, or sable, usually seen in black, blue, blue merle, brindle, gold, lilac, red, or red merle (with or without patches of white)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 17 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, energetic, responsive, keen, athletic, loyal, alert</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Scotland</p><p><br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Border Collie</h2><p>This breed is extremely driven, loyal, and hard-working. Border collies are happiest when they are working or playing, and will only settle down for cuddle time when the workday is done. Border collies are very sensitive to noise and will alert you to visitors, passersby, and any other movement. They may also be sensitive to sudden loud noises like fireworks and thunder.</p><h2>History of the Border Collie</h2><p>The border collie originates from sheepdogs on the British Isles and was developed on the border of England and Scotland (after which it was eventually named). The border collie has remained true to its origins as a hardy, diligent, working dog. In the mid-1800s, Queen Victoria became quite fond of the breed and likely contributed to its legacy as the ideal sheep-herding dog breed.</p><p>Over the years, the border collie has upheld its reputation as a highly intelligent worker. The breed was brought to the sheep ranches of Australia and New Zealand in the past century. Border collies have been highly successful at herding, agility, Frisbee, and many other activities. The border collie was officially recognized by the AKC in 1995.</p><h2>Border Collie Care</h2><p>A border collie won't tolerate being alone. It's not enough to provide room to roam; your dog needs someone to roam with and something specific to do. When bored, this dog may develop habits such as chasing cars, digging, chewing up furniture, or barking. You find plenty of activities for your border collie if you want it to thrive. You may also note that this dog will exhibit typical herding behavior by nudging and nipping at humans and other pets to get them in line. If you are a multi-pet household, this might lead to altercations.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>It's important to understand that border collies are extremely high-energy dogs. This breed needs tons of exercise and plenty of activities to keep the body and mind occupied and in good shape. At a bare minimum, you must be able to provide a long, brisk walk (preferably two) for a total of two hours a day. You will need to walk on-leash as border collies are prone to chasing cars and bicycles. In a safe area, you can play fetch or Frisbee to work off some of the energy and provide the dog with a task to complete. Although they are are superb herding dogs, they also excel in most dog sports, especially agility and disc dog competition.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The border collie may have either a rough or smooth medium-length double coat with a coarse outer coat and a soft undercoat. They should be groomed routinely; regular weekly brushing is important to keep the coat tangle-free. They only need a bath every three months or so.</p><p>Although active border collies may have naturally worn down nails, it's important to check the nails regularly and trim the nails as needed. This will help keep the feet healthy and comfortable. You should also pay attention to dental hygiene and brush the dog's teeth at least two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The breed is one of the smartest dogs and learns new things with ease. Thorough training is essential and it should not be very difficult for this perceptive dog. Also, be sure to properly socialize your dog so it will be at ease in all kinds of situations.</p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible dog breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A border collie will need two meals a day of .75 to 1 cup of dry dog food each time, depending on the dog's size and activity level. Be sure to provide fresh, clean water.</p><p>Your dog's nutritional needs will change throughout its lifespan. If you note that your dog is putting on weight, discuss this with your veterinarian to develop a plan of action. You may need to change the feeding schedule, type, or amount of food. You should also consider whether you are providing enough daily exercise for this naturally tireless dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Border Collie</h2><p>You may be able to easily find border collies in shelters or as rescues. Too many owners surrender border collies because they were unprepared for the high amount of attention and exercise this breed needs. If you feel a border collie is right for you, a great place to start your search is through The Border Collie Society of America. Their breeder referral directory provides contact information for breeders as well as rescue groups throughout the U.S. Adoption costs run a few hundred dollars, however expect to pay more to a breeder who may charge between $700 to $2,000 for a border collie puppy.</p><h2>Border Collie Overview</h2><p>Loyal and hard-working</p><p>Excellent at dog sports and agility</p><p>Highly intelligent and trainable</p><p>Can get destructive if not given enough exercise, stimulation, and companionship</p><p>Not suitable for small space living as they need a yard (or a farm) to expend energy</p><p>Strong herding instincts may make them unsuitable for households with small children or other pets</p>",997

""Spitz"" is a term that's used to describe a group of dogs with similar characteristics, namely a thick double coat, a wedge-shaped head, upright triangular ears, and a long tail that curls up and over the back. Also called Northern breeds, spitz breeds are frequently found in cold and snowy parts of the world. The Korean Jindo is a natural breed, meaning it developed without much manipulation from humans.</p><p>When paired up with the right person, this breed is loyal, protective, and makes an excellent watchdog that rarely feels separation anxiety or clinginess. A Korean Jindo is also calm, clean, and well-behaved, making it an enjoyable house pet in the right situation. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 17.5 to 21.5 inches tall at the shoulder.</p><p>WEIGHT: 33 to 50 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium length, double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Red fawn, white, black, black and tan, wolf grey and brindle, with a light undercoat</p><p>LIFE SPAN: About 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Careful, intelligent, calm, protective, faithful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Korea</p><h2>Characteristics of the Korean Jindo</h2><p>The Korean Jindo is beautiful to behold but is also one that demands a specific type of owner. They are tremendously territorial, which makes them great watchdogs. However, their territorial nature means they can be aggressive toward other animals, especially other dogs of the same sex. Korean Jindos are also suspicious of strangers, to the point that it can be difficult to have other people watch the dog if you must be out of town. In the right hands, the Korean Jindo is an exceedingly loyal and faithful companion.</p><h2>History of the Korean Jindo</h2><p>The Korean Jindo originated on a small island off the coast of South Korea called Jindo, from which the breed takes its name. The Korean Jindo was known on this island for thousands of years where it lived amongst humans but was allowed to roam freely. They hunted alongside their owners and guarded their homes. In Korea, the Jindo is considered a national treasure. Korean Jindos were included in the opening ceremonies of the 1988 Olympic Games, which were held in Seoul, Korea.  </p><p>In the United States, the Korean Jindo is recognized by the United Kennel Club, where it is part of the Northern Breeds group. The Korean Jindo is also part of the Foundation Stock Service in the American Kennel Club, which is the first step toward eventual full recognition of the breed. The Korean Jindo is also recognized by the international kennel club Fédération Cynologique International.</p><h2>Korean Jindo Care</h2><p>Korean Jindos were primarily used for hunting and guarding the home. They have lots of energy and tons of prey drive (the instinct to chase and kill animals). Providing lots of outlets for both physical and mental stimulation will allow your Korean Jindo to remain calm and quietly watchful at home.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Jindos may not need as much exercise as you might think. If you give them several brisk walks a day that add up to about 30 minutes total, your dog may be satisfied, though they can always go longer if you prefer. Since they are strong and athletic, Korean Jindos will be ready for hunting, jogging, long walks, or hiking, but arduous periods of exercise are not daily necessities. Always keep a Korean Jindo on a leash when out and let it only play in a securely fenced yard. For mental stimulation, Jindos particularly appreciate challenging puzzle toys and squeaking plush toys they can shred (to simulate prey),</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Korean Jindo coat is wash-and-wear, and they don't really need much washing. The Korean Jindo is naturally clean, and its coat smells and feels great even with just occasional baths. They don't drool and don't shed much outside of the twice-yearly seasonal shed. During this time the Korean Jindo loses a lot of its undercoat so shedding will be heavy at this time. Extra brushing (even daily) will help keep the shed hair under control. Outside of these seasonal shedding times, the rest of the year the Korean Jindo sheds little and stays neat with just brushing once a week. Trim your Korean Jindo's nails weekly look inside the ears, cleaning with a pet-safe ear cleaner if they appear dirty.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Korean Jindo is highly intelligent, but they are not easy to train. They are independent and don't always have a strong desire to please humans like some other breeds that are eager to learn tricks and commands. Korean Jindos benefit from abundant training and early socialization, especially around children, to help them develop into confident dogs that do not overreact to ""suspicious"" situations (for instance, friendly strangers coming into the home).</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>In general, the Korean Jindo is a healthy and long-lived breed. According to the national breed club in North America, the Korean Jindo Association of America, a few health conditions have been identified in the breed, including discoid lupus erythematosus (an autoimmune disease) and hypothyroidism. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Korean Jindo high-quality dog food (ask your breeder or veterinarian for a recommendation). Rather than leaving food out all day (called free feeding), portion out meals with a measuring cup or scale to avoid overfeeding. Free feeding can lead to weight gain. Obesity and being overweight can contribute to health issues and compromise joints. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy</h2><p>The Korean Jindo is a very rare breed. Some adult Korean Jindos or Jindo mixes might find their way into a rescue situation, but usually, people who want a Korean Jindo must look for a reputable breeder for a puppy. The Korean Jindo Association of America publishes a list of breeders on its website. Be prepared to have to wait for some time (even years) for a puppy to become available. Bred puppies may cost on average of between $1,000 to $3,000.</p><p>To adopt this breed, try the Treasured K9s, an organization that specializes in rescuing and rehoming Jindos. When adopting, consider that this breed bonds very closely with one owner, and can be difficult to rehome in the event the owner must give the dog up. But you can always discuss this issue with the rehoming organization.</p><h2>Korean Jindo Overview</h2><p>Steadfastly loyal </p><p>Excellent watchdog</p><p>Clean and calm in the house</p><p>Not generally safe with dogs or other pets</p><p>Not good with strangers</p><p>Difficult to train</p>",1036

They are highly intelligent and take well to obedience training, but can suffer from separation anxiety due to their companionable nature. They do well around children and other pets and are well-suited to life in smaller spaces thanks to their petite size.</p><h2>History of the Toy Poodle</h2><p>The poodle was bred to be a duck hunting dog in Germany over 400 years ago, where its thick curly coat came in handy to protect against the cold. Their athletic skills and eagerness to please made them perfect retrievers.</p><p>The exaggerated show cut that poodles are often recognized for today stemmed from their historic days of retrieving. Hunters would cut the dogs' coats to ensure they had free range of movement while also having adequate protection from the elements. So, hunters would shave their poodle's legs, neck, and tail. Their chest, hips, and leg joints would still be covered with curly hair in rounded tufts.</p><p>Poodles have three variations standard, miniature, and toy. The standard poodle is the oldest of these varieties and the miniature and toy variations were eventually created for those who desired smaller dogs. Despite their small size, toy and miniature poodles were working dogs. Toy poodles, specifically, have historically been desired for circuses due to their high intelligence and athleticism.</p><p>The toy poodle was first bred in the early 20th century as a companion dog, especially great for those living in apartments or smaller spaces. The poodle was first recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1886 and the Poodle Club of America was founded ten years later. Today, poodles are exceedingly popular among pet owners, especially those in France. In fact, the poodle is the national dog of France.</p><h2>Toy Poodle Care</h2><p>Though poodles have gained a reputation of being fancy and high-maintenance, they really are no harder to care for than the average dog. In particular, toy poodles are considered the easiest of the bunch, due to their small size acts like grooming and exercise will take no time at all thanks to their petite frame.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>While larger standard poodles need plenty of room and exercise to thrive, smaller toy poodles do not. However, they are still an active breed and love going for daily walks with their loved ones. They also love swimming, retrieving, and performing tricks to burn off energy.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Due to the toy poodle's thick and curly coat, owners will need to brush their dogs daily from root to end to prevent any matting. If their coat develops mats, toy poodles may need to be shaved quite short to give their hair a chance to grow back nicely. Fine-toothed combs with sturdy teeth are great options to keep in your toy poodle grooming kit they get the job done well without causing a significant amount of discomfort for the dog.</p><p>Toy poodles don't shed, making them a great pet for people with allergies. Still, some owners prefer to keep their toy poodle's coat cut short to reduce the chance of matting and make clean-up after a muddy play session a little easier. Owners may opt to do the trimming themselves with a pair of clippers or head to a pro every six weeks for a cut, bath, and nail trim. Luckily, it's easy to train a toy poodle to behave at the groomer. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Toy poodles are an intelligent breed and absolutely love to please their owner. As active and graceful dogs, they excel at sporting activities. This may come as a shock to those who believe poodles are prissy or feminine a common misconception. Toy poodles are great at learning and performing tricks.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Purebred toy poodles are generally healthy, but as with any pet, there are health risks. Always make sure to get your toy poodle from a reputable breeder who tests their puppies for common health problems and can provide you with medical paperwork before you commit.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The best food for your dog will depend on its size and activity level. Because toy poodles are small in size, they don't require a large number of calories each day. If they are fed above their ideal caloric level, they may become overweight or even obese without proper exercise to burn it off. It's important to work with your vet to find the right food for your pet and the portion control required to keep them healthy.</p><p>Whether you choose wet, raw, or dry food, you should go for something relatively high in protein and fiber, but without too many fillers like corn bran or oat hulls. The ideal dog food should contain mostly whole foods and quality sources of protein, including things like real meat and vegetables.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Toy Poodle</h2><p>If you decide to purchase your toy poodle from a breeder, make sure that they are reputable. Top-notch breeders may have certifications or awards and they are always honest about health concerns and can provide their customers with health information for their puppies.</p><p>Toy poodle rescues often cannot provide that level of information on their puppies. However, the heartwarming thing about adopting is that you know you are giving a dog a happier and healthier life than they had before.</p><p>Be sure to check out options local to you, too. There are reputable breeders across the country and local rescues, even if they aren't breed-specific, often have toy poodles up for adoption.</p><h2>Toy Poodle Overview</h2><p>Suitable for small spaces</p><p>Smart and eager to please</p><p>Low shedding</p><p>High grooming needs</p><p>Can bark loudly</p><p>Prone to dental issues</p>",1015

It's a well-muscled, strongly built breed, but the dog is not bulky and instead, presents a balanced and proportioned appearance. It's known to carry its head proudly and carries its tail down forming a ""J"" except when it runs and the tail is trailing straight out from the body. This breed's most distinctive feature is its hind double dewclaws, forming a pair of independent ""thumbs"" on the rear legs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 24 to 27.5 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 70 to 110 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, coarse, and dense coat no more than 1.5 inches in length</p><p>COAT COLOR: Two color combinations of black and tan and harlequin (a mix of gray, black, and tan)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, friendly, fearless, calm, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: France</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Proud Beauceron</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Beauceron</h2><p>The desire of a herding dog to keep its ""flock"" together, be it children, the neighborhood cats, or sheep, oftentimes frustrates an owner, but it is what a Beauceron was bred to do. In general, the breed is generally tolerant with children, affectionate with its family, and protective of its flock, both human and animal.</p><h2>History of the Beauceron</h2><p>Developed in France, the Beauceron is the largest French sheepdog, and possibly one of the oldest as well, with mentions in historical documents dating as far back as the 1500s. The breed was found throughout France and not just in the Beauce region. The double declaws on the hind leg suggest the breed came from the same ancestors as the long-haired Briard sheepdog, although many times it is often mistaken for a mixed breed of Rottweiler and German shepherd parentage. This breed is also known as (shepherd of Beauce) and  (red stockings for the dog's reddish accents).</p><p>The Beauceron has long served farms in France herding sheep and cattle. During the world wars, Beaucerons were used by the French army, especially as messengers due to their ability to follow commands. They also were used in mine detection and tracking. These canines continue to be used as police dogs and in search and rescue operations.</p><p>The Beauceron was virtually unknown outside of France until World War II. The French Ministry of Agriculture asked the Society Central Canine to write a confirmation examination in the 1960s to ensure the qualities of the breed were preserved. There was a concern that with modernization, the breed would die out or be diluted. The breed was fully inducted into the American Kennel Club's Herding Group in 2007 and first appeared at the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 2008.</p><h2>Beauceron Care</h2><p>The Beauceron is watchful, loyal, energetic, and protective. Having one is like having a shadow follow you around all day. The dog will often stay very close at your heels and it will want to be with family on the couch or bed. Like many dogs, herding breeds can be destructive and irritating when bored. The Beauceron likes to mouth things, so have plenty of durable chew toys available.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Lots and lots of exercise is the key to a happy and healthy herder like a Beauceron. Experts recommend this breed needs at least two to three hours of daily vigorous exercise a day which should include walks and other activities such as running, cycling, and hiking. The Beauceron can be an ideal companion for a committed physically active owner.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The dog's double coat needs only minimal grooming. Brush your dog regularly and give it a bath every three or four months. You will see the most shedding in the spring and fall and just a little the rest of the year. Be sure to trim your dog's nails about once a month to keep them tidy and prevent painful splitting. Don't forget about the hind double dewclaws. Be sure to help your dog with oral hygiene by brushing its teeth at least twice a week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>An intelligent breed, the Beauceron is often described by owners as an independent thinking dog. It is highly trainable and can put its energy to good use in dog sports and obedience competitions. This dog has a high, strong drive to work and it needs to be given a job to do in order to thrive. Socialize your dog from a young age to expose it to a variety of situations so it is not shy or aggressive.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While any dog breed can develop health problems, responsible breeders take care to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs, like the American Kennel Club. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Allow access to fresh, clean water and feed your Beauceron a veterinary-recommended diet. The amount will vary depending on your dog's size, age, activity level, and other factors. This breed may be prone to gastric dilation and bloat if the dog gulps its food or eats too fast, which can be fatal.</p><p>Monitor your dog's weight and discuss nutritional needs with your veterinarian so your dog doesn't become overweight, as this can increase health risks and shorten life span.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Beauceron</h2><p>Because this is a rare dog breed, there are relatively few Beauceron breeders in the United States. Be patient if this is the breed you really want. The puppy closest to your home may not be the best one for you, so you may have to be willing to travel or expand your search for a breeder in other areas. If you work with a breeder, expect to pay around $2,500 for a puppy. Consider these sources to begin your search for a Beauceron.</p><h2>Beauceron Overview</h2><p>Light shedding</p><p>Loyal and intelligent dog</p><p>Active dog, requiring mental and physical stimulation</p><p>Herding behavior can be overwhelming</p><p>May not be appropriate for a family with small children</p><p>Boredom can lead to destructive behavior</p>",964

Today, the Persian cat is the most popular pedigreed cat breed in the U.S.. The Persian cat is a medium- to large-sized breed. The trademark characteristics of the Persian cat are a round, flat face shaped like a pansy and a profuse, long coat. The coat comes in almost every color and pattern imaginable, including solid shades, silver and golden, smoke and shaded colors, tabby patterns, particolors and bicolors, and pointed colors (Himalayan).</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>OTHER NAMES: None.</p><p>PERSONALITY: Sweet, gentle and affectionate.</p><p>WEIGHT: About 7 to 12 pounds.</p><p>LENGTH: About 14 to 17 inches. </p><p>COAT LENGTH: Long all over the body and thick, with an immense ruff around the neck, deep frill extending between the front legs and very full brush tail. Glossy, with a fine texture. </p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid (blue, black, white, red, cream, chocolate or lilac), silver and golden (chinchilla and shaded), shaded and smoke (including cameo and tortoiseshell patterns), tabby, particolor, calico and bicolor, and Himalayan (pointed colors).</p><p>EYE COLOR: Varies according to coat color, but may be copper, blue, green, blue-green, hazel and odd-eyed.</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 15 to 20 years.</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No.</p><p>ORIGIN: Persia and Iran.</p><h3>Characteristics of the Persian Cat</h3><p>The Persian cat is known and loved for its very sweet, gentle, calm disposition. Though Persian cats are quite friendly, they require gentle handling, which means no roughhousing or grabbing from young children. They get along great with kind, respectful kids, but would rather be stroked and admired than engage in strenuous activities. Persians also enjoy the company of other cats and gentle dogs. Persians love to sprawl out in favorite spot in the home with good vantage points to keep an eye on the goings-on in the household, be it a plush chair or sun-filled window ledge. Persians are homebodies. It's best to keep them indoors to prevent overheating or tangling up their profuse, long coats. Persian cats love their human families, but they don't mind being left alone for short periods of time as long as they are in their own homes where they feel comfortable and safe. </p><h2>History of the Persian Cat</h2><h2>Persian Cat Care </h2><p>The Persian cat's profuse, luxurious, flowing coat requires a lot of grooming perhaps the most in all of the cat kingdom. The coat is long and very thick. Brushing alone is not enough. To prevent mats from forming, a Persian in full coat needs daily combing with a wide-toothed metal comb, followed by daily brushing with a soft slicker brush. When combing, Persian cat owners must take care to part the hair and ensure they are combing all the way down to the skin, or mats will sneakily form underneath the long hair. Regular bathing is also necessary to keep the coat clean, something that can also help prevent mats. After a bath, the coat should be carefully dried with a pet hair drier that runs cooler than a human hair dryer so you don't burn your cat's sensitive skin or cause it to overheat. Persian cats also need their faces washed daily (the large, round eyes are prone to tearing), their nails trimmed weekly or every other week, and their ears checked and cleaned if they become dirty.</p><p>If a Persian cat's coat becomes matted, it is very difficult to demat. Dematting is a process that is tedious and can be uncomfortable for the cat. Sometimes, mats must be cut out (always by a professional groomer or your veterinarian). Due to the difficulty of upkeep, some Persian cat owners opt to have their cats professionally groomed. The groomer can shave a Persian cat's belly to take off some bulk and eliminate the issue of mats forming on the stomach and under the armpits. Another option is a lion trim: the body of the cat is shaved short, leaving fluffy hair on the head, legs, and tail.  </p><p>Persians are fairly sedate cats, though they enjoy playing with feather wands or other teaser toys. Engaging your Persian cat in play sessions a few times a day can provide a bit of exercise to keep your cat physically and mentally stimulated. Scratching is another physically engaging activity that cats naturally want to do. Encourage scratching in the right places by setting up approved scratching areas in your house. Be sure to use both vertical scratchers (such as tall posts or cat trees) and horizontal scratchers (such as cardboard or sisal scratchers that lie flat on the ground), because these can provide an outlet for your cat to scratch in different ways.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Some purebred cats are more prone to developing certain breed-specific diseases. Persians (as well as Himalayans and Exotic Shorthairs) are genetically predisposed to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a disease of the heart), numerous eye problems including progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and trichiasis, polycystic kidney disease (PKD), and respiratory problems. Reputable Persian cat breeders have their adult cats screened for these problems prior to breeding them to keep from passing unwanted health traits on to kittens. <br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Persian is a medium-to large-sized cat with short, muscular legs, a short back, a cobby, sturdy body and a deep chest. The Persian cat is immediately recognizable by its very flat face with full cheeks, large round eyes, a short muzzle and a short snub-nose, round cheeks, a firm chin, medium-sized ears, and large, round eyes. All of these facial components give the Persian cat a very sweet expression that is almost human-like. The Persian cat's coat is extremely long and profuse, with a dense undercoat that provides a lot of volume. The Persian cat comes in many different colors and patterns. <br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because the Persian cat is heavily built, the breed may become overweight if allowed to eat too much. For all cats, staying lean is healthier, and it can prevent the cat from developing obesity-related health issues like diabetes and heart disease. To manage your Persian cat's food intake, feed measured meals twice a day instead of filling up the food bowl all the time (a practice called free feeding). Young kittens should eat three times a day. If you're not sure what to feed or how much food your Persian needs daily, talk to your veterinarian or breeder for advice.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Persian Cat</h2><p>The Persian is the most popular pedigreed cat breed in the U.S., so if you have your heart set on bringing home a kitten, you shouldn't have too much trouble finding a great breeder nearby. The Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association both list active Persian cat breeders on their respective websites. You can also find adult Persian cats in animal shelters and through cat rescue groups, if you would rather rescue a cat. Local Persian cat breeders might also know of someone looking to re-home their adult Persian.</p><h2>Breed Overview</h2><p>Happiest when at home, the Persian cat is neither needy nor aloof, but a mixture of quiet affection and calm independence. Persians tend to be fairly quiet, but when they vocalize, they have sweet, musical voices. They love to cuddle or hang out next to you, and will happily greet you at the door when you come home.</p><p>Mellow and sweet personality                                                     </p><p>Affectionate and friendly with adults, gentle kids and other pets<br/></p><p>Doesn't mind hanging out alone occasionally</p><p>Doesn't enjoy loud and boisterous activity<br/></p><p>Need daily face washing to combat tear stains<br/></p><p>Coat requires daily combing and possibly professional grooming</p><p>More Cat Breeds and Further Research</p><p>If you like the Persian cat, you might also like these cat breeds: </p><p>       Exotic Shorthair</p><p>       Himalayan</p><p>       Ragdoll</p><p> </p>",1234
130,https://www.thesprucepets.com/puli-dog-breed-profile-4774459,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Herding Dog Breeds,<h1>Puli: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Puli: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The puli (pronounced poo-lee) is a medium-sized herding dog known in Hungary for centuries. The distinctively dreadlocked puli certainly stands out in the dog world. The dog's corded coat can grow long, so the hair may eventually reach to the ground, hiding the legs, and making the puli appear like it's floating across the ground. The puli's hair serves a real purpose: The dog was bred to herd sheep in Hungary, and the thick, wooly, and corded coat protected it against harsh weather and any predators, such as wolves.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 16 to 17 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 25 to 35 pounds</p><p>COAT: Dense, weather-resistant coat that forms cords in adults</p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid colors only: black, rusty black, gray, or white</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, energetic, obedient, loyal, sensitive, loving, and affectionate</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Hungary</p><h2>Characteristics of the Puli</h2><p>These charming dogs are wonderful family companions. Pulis (or pulik) are friendly, energetic, and mischievous. They love to have fun but are also great at reading your mood and know when you need a snuggle. They are active and playful well into their senior years. Pulis get along well with other dogs and love playing with kids, as long as children are taught to respect the dog and not to pull on the dreadlocks. They may or may not get along with cats, depending on the individual dog and whether they were raised together. </p><h2>History of the Puli</h2><p>For centuries, the puli has been used to herd sheep and guard farms in Hungary. Naturally protective and watchful, today's puli retains its guarding instinct, as well as the instinct to gather and drive a flock of sheep. If there are no sheep around, the puli is not picky. They will herd family pets, kids, chickens pretty much anything that moves.</p><p>The puli breed survived World War II, and a few dogs made it over to the United States for herd and guard dog use. The puli quickly made an impression in the U.S. and the breed has been recognized by the American Kennel Club since 1936, where it's part of the Herding Group. </p><p>Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Cilla, own an unclipped cream-colored puli named Beast who has its own Facebook page with over 2 million followers.</p><h2>Puli Care</h2><p>Grooming is probably the biggest challenge of owning a puli, more so than exercise and training. If you own a puli, you have a choice in whether to cord the coat or keep it brushed out or clipped. Many pet pulis are not corded for convenience because it's a lot of work to upkeep the dreadlocks.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Beneath all that hair, pulis are athletic and energetic. They need plenty of daily exercise and mental stimulation to be happy. Although long walks (aim for an hour a day total), hikes, and games of fetch can do the trick, many puli owners participate in organized dog sports like herding, agility, flyball, and obedience. It's also a herding dog that needs a large fenced-in yard to run around and dispel all of its energy.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>A puli's cords form naturally, starting when a puppy is about nine months old. You will need to help the coat along, separating the mats to the skin. Your breeder or a groomer knowledgeable in corded coats can help you guide the coat so it cords properly and doesn't turn into one giant mat.</p><p>Bathing a corded puli takes a special technique and patience, as it takes a long time to get the cords wet and to rinse the soap out completely. Drying is the real challenge it can take hours just as it does to dry a wool sweater starting with wringing out the cords starting at the ends, and squeezing more moisture out with towels. Some owners use a special cage dryer for dogs, but you can use a blow dryer and absorbent microfiber towels to do the job. It's vital to make sure the cords are thoroughly dry after bathing or the damp cords can mildew. </p><p>If you choose to keep your puli brushed out or trimmed and not corded, it's extremely important to still thoroughly brush the dog out from the skin at least once a week to prevent mats from forming. The hair above the eyes can also be trimmed to help the dog see better.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Pulis are highly intelligent and easy to train and with positive methods, these dogs can be taught lots of fun tricks. Early socialization for puppies is important to curb the breed's natural wariness of strangers and to help the puli develop into a confident adult dog. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like most purebred dogs, the puli is prone to a few genetic conditions. Responsible breeders test their adult dogs before breeding them to avoid passing on inherited diseases.</p><p>Additional recommended testing includes OFA for elbows, OFA for cardiac (heart), OFA for thyroid, and brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER) hearing test.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your puli a high-quality dog food. Your breeder or veterinarian can give you a recommendation regarding the best food for this breed due to its predisposition to some hereditary joint conditions. It's important not to allow your puli to become overweight. Feed scheduled meals using a measuring cup or scale to ensure your puli isn't consuming more than they need. Keeping the bowl filled with food all the time can lead to snacking and overeating. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy</h2><p>If you want a puppy, spend some time searching for a reputable breeder. Once you find a breeder, you might have to wait a while for a puppy to become available. Expect to pay a breeder between $800 to $1,600 for a puli puppy. If you are looking to adopt, some adult puli mixes may find their way into rescue.

131,https://www.thesprucepets.com/shih-tzu-poodle-mix-5216727,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hybrid Dog Breeds,"<h1>Shih Tzu Poodle Mix - Full Profile, History, and Care</h1>","<h1>Shih Tzu Poodle Mix - Full Profile, History, and Care</h1><p>The shih tzu poodle mix, often referred to as a ""shih-poo,"" shih poo"" or ""shihpoo,"" is a hybrid breed created by crossing shih tzu with poodles. The two smaller poodle varieties toy and miniature poodles are used to cross with the shih tzu, which is also a small breed. Standard poodles are not crossbred with shih tzu because mixing very large breeds with small breeds is a risky practice that can result in complications with the mother or puppies. </p><p>Although shedding breeds, such as labrador retrievers and golden retrievers are often crossbred with Poodles in the hopes of capitalizing on the non-shedding and hypoallergenic nature of the Poodle coat, the shih tzu is naturally a low-shedding, hypoallergenic breed. Although crossing the shih tzu with the poodle is not necessary to get a low-shedding coat, some shih tzu poodle mixes may shed less than others. </p><p>Because both shih tzu and poodles have low-shedding or non-shedding coats, mixes of these two breeds may be less likely to cause problems in people with dog allergies. If you are allergic to dogs, always spend time with any dog or puppy you are considering bringing home, including shih tzu poodle mixes, to make sure the dog doesn't cause allergy symptoms.</p><p>With any crossbreed or mixed breed, physical traits and personality are highly variable, and each puppy or dog is an individual. Shih tzu poodle mixes are generally small, weighing between 7 and 20 pounds on average, but other physical characteristics may range wildly. </p><p>Most shih tzu poodle mixes shed very little or not at all, but some have straight coats, some have curly coats and some have wavy coats. Because many different colors and patterns appear in each parent breed, shih tzu colors and markings are nearly endless, but shih tzu poodle mixes may be black, white, brown, red, silver, gold, blue or apricot, with or without white markings or dark-colored patches.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hybrid</p><p>Weight: Varies, but usually 7 to 20 pounds.</p><p>Height: Varies, but usually 8 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder.</p><p>Coat: May be straight, wavy or curly. </p><p>Color: Variable, but may be black, white, brown, red, silver, gold, blue or apricot, with or without white markings or dark-colored patches.</p><p>Life Expectancy: Variable; generally 10 to 17 years.</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: North America</p><h2>Characteristics</h2><p>In personality, shih tzu poodle mixes are generally sweet, friendly, playful and affectionate. The main ""job"" of the shih tzu as well as toy and miniature Poodles is to be a loving companion, and the shih tzu poodle mix usually inherits these qualities. Small enough to be portable, the shih tzu poodle mix wants to be with you always, and is happiest when accompanying you on your travels and adventures. </p><h2>History of the Shih Tzu Poodle Mix</h2><p>People have been crossing Poodles with every breed imaginable since the ""doodle craze"" swept North America in the 2000s. Although purebred dogs are carefully bred over generations according to the breed standard (the written description of the ideal physical and temperamental traits of the breed), hybrid dogs like the shih tzu poodle mix have no official standard. This means that characteristics like height and weight, body structure, color, coat type, and temperament are less predictable than they are in purebred dogs. Different breeders may have different ideas of what constitutes the perfect shih tzu poodle mix. Additionally, shih tzu poodle mixes are not recognized by any of the reputable purebred dog registries such as the American Kennel Club or United Kennel Club. </p><h2>Shih Tzu Poodle Mix Care</h2><p>The low-shedding coats of both shih tzu and poodles require of upkeep, and the grooming requirements for shih tzu poodle mixes are similar. Generally, the curlier a Shih Tzu Poodle mix's coat, the less it will shed. Brush daily or every other day to keep the coat untangled and to prevent mats from forming. Like poodles and shih tzu, shih tzu poodle mixes require regular haircuts from a professional groomer. Grooming frequency varies depending on the shih tzu poodle mix's coat, but count on scheduling an appointment every four to 12 weeks. Also trim the nails every two weeks and check the ears once a week, cleaning them with a pet safe ear cleaner if they appear dirty. Excessive dirt or redness in the ears means a veterinary visit is in order.</p><p>Shih tzu poodle mixes are smart, but how trainable they are depends whether they inherited more the eager-to-please personality of the Poodle or the more stubborn nature of the shih tzu. Regardless, positive-reinforcement methods like clicker training using tasty treat rewards gets great results from any dog. Despite being indoor dogs, shih tzu poodle mixes still need some exercise. Aim for two walks a day or one walk and one play session in a safely enclosed space like your fenced yard. More energetic shih tzu poodle mixes with trainable personalities might also like training for fun dog sports like agility, flyball, and obedience. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although many people who breed and sell hybrid dogs say that mixing two different purebreds results in puppies that are healthier than either parent breed, science tells us that genes don't work like that. Each breed has certain inherited health disorders in their family background, and those health issues can be passed on to the puppies in a litter. Breeding shih tzu to poodles means the puppies could potentially inherit any of the genetic diseases common to either breed. </p><p>Shih tzu are prone to hip dysplasia, patellar luxation (slipped kneecap), and various eye problems including cataracts, progressive retinal atrophy, retinal detachment, and eyelid abnormalities. Poodles are affected by certain genetic health conditions, including hip dysplasia, eye diseases, idiopathic epilepsy, von Willebrand's disease, immune-mediated disorders, Legg-Calve-Perthes disease (a hip joint disorder), and luxating patellas (slipped kneecaps).</p><p>Responsible breeders start with healthy, well-bred adult purebred shih tzu and poodles and test them for the genetic diseases common to their breed before breeding them together. Responsible breeders should also test their adult shih tzu poodle hybrids before breeding them to decrease the odds that the puppies will inherit genetic issues. Responsible breeders also offer a health guarantee on their puppies that protects the puppy buyer in case the puppy develop a genetic disease later in life. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It's important to keep Shih tzu poodles at a healthy, lean weight to stave of the development or worsening of joint disorders like hip dysplasia and luxating patella, as well as other weight-linked health problems like diabetes. Many shih tzu poodles will overeat if you keep the bowl filled, so instead serve measured meals twice a day. Ask to your veterinarian for a recommendation for a healthy food for your shih tzu poodle mix, as well as an ideal healthy weight for your adult shih tzu poodle.</p><p>Intelligent <br/></p><p>May be low-shedding</p><p>Affectionate and playful</p><p>Can be problem barkers</p><p>May be stubborn or hard to train</p><p>Not always non-shedding or hypoallergenic </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy</h2><p>If you're thinking about purchasing a shih tzu poodle mix puppy, first consider checking out your local animal shelters and rescue organizations to see if you can find a shih tzu poodle mix looking for a new home. Although most shih tzu poodle mixes in shelters and rescues are adults, it's possible to find a shih tzu poodle mix puppy in need of rescue.

This tiny and playful package comes with a huge personality. The breed was developed when breeders crossed small smooth fox terriers with various toy dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 8.5 to 11.5 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 4 to 7 pounds</p><p>COAT: Smooth, shiny, and fine single coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, white and tan, or white and tan, or white and black; spots and ticking can sometimes be found on the body</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Playful, friendly, loyal, intelligent, alert, spirited</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Toy Fox Terrier</h2><p>These dogs tend to form very strong bonds with their families. They are fun-loving and often make eager and playful companions for respectful, but often older children. They can also be fiercely loyal and make excellent watchdogs. Watch for uncontrolled alert barking or you could have some frustrated neighbors. Toy fox terriers are intelligent and energetic and, while very affectionate, they aren't known for being lapdogs.</p><h2>History of the Toy Fox Terrier</h2><p>The toy fox terrier is a true American. They were first developed in the late 19th and early 20th century when breeders of smooth fox terriers in the United States crossed them with toy breeds. These included Chihuahuas, miniature pinschers, Manchester terriers, and Italian greyhounds.</p><p>The original fox terriers were introduced in England to force foxes out of their dens to allow the hunt to start their chase. They were known for being brave, determined, and athletic.</p><p>Breeders of the toy fox terrier wanted a smaller dog with similar characteristics. These little dogs would still be ferocious ratters around farms and homesteads but would have a more gentle disposition than their bigger relatives.</p><p>Their size, smarts, and agility meant they also became popular additions in traveling circuses, and could often be found on the arm of a clown, performing tricks for a captivated audience. This also helped endear them to a wider audience.</p><p>The United Kennel Club recognized toy fox terriers in 1936, but the American Kennel Club didn't give them official full breed status until 2003.</p><h2>Toy Fox Terrier Care</h2><p>Toy fox terriers are super smart, confident, affectionate, and lively. Although they are small, they will always let you know when they're in the room, and that energy can sometimes make them a bit of a challenge. They are playful, wily, and full of beans, so making sure they have a good selection of enrichment activities and interactive toys will be essential. These dogs will likely find their own, much less appropriate ways of keeping themselves entertained otherwise.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>You will need to make sure that your dog gets plenty of exercise; a quick walk around the block isn't enough for these spritely and adaptable characters. Instead, a vigorous 30-minute walk every day will burn off excess energy. This dog will enjoy accompanying you on hikes and can make a great agility competitor. There are a number of champion toy fox terriers in various dog sports.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The breed has a low-maintenance and basic grooming regime. The dog's smooth, short coat only sheds moderately and will need weekly brushing to remove dead hairs and keep it looking shiny and healthy. As with all dogs, it's important to brush your terrier's teeth to prevent dental disease.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Toy fox terriers don't have as much of a stubborn and willful streak as some of their terrier relatives. These intelligent little creatures are eager to please which means they respond well to training using reward-based methods. They also love to learn fun tricks, which will keep them happily occupied.</p><p>You will have to work hard on achieving a rock-solid recall around distractions, and they may even need to stay on the leash in certain environments where there's too much temptation to chase small animals like squirrels or rabbits.</p><p>It will be best to give your terrier early, appropriate, and ongoing socialization. If you don't, the dog will become too protective and it will become more of a guard dog than a chipper playmate.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Toy fox terriers are generally considered to be robust little dogs that can live a long and healthy life. As with any breed, however, they can be prone to certain inheritable conditions.</p><p>By finding a reputable breeder that performs the recommended health checks on prospective parents, you can reduce the risk of some of these conditions developing.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>As with any dog, you should feed your toy fox terrier high-quality food and a properly portion-controlled diet. It can be tempting to spoil your dog with tasty treats and table scraps, but obesity is a major problem for dogs, and it can lead to a host of more serious health problems, such as diabetes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Toy Fox Terrier</h2><p>The importance of finding a good breeder when you are searching for a puppy can't be overstated. It means you will have a much better chance of having a healthy and well-socialized pup that has had the best start in life. Depending on the breeder, expect to pay between $600 to $1,200 for a toy fox terrier puppy.</p><p>Have you considered adopting a toy fox terrier or similar breed? Offering a forever home to a dog in need can be a hugely rewarding experience. There are lots of deserving terriers in shelters across the country, or you could reach out to breed-specific rescues.</p><h2>Toy Fox Terrier Overview</h2><p>Fun-loving and playful</p><p>Incredibly loyal and affectionate</p><p>Smart and easy to train</p><p>Can have a high prey drive</p><p>Can be vocal</p><p>Not a lap-dog and needs lots of exercise and enrichment</p>",931

It's known for its graceful, slender body and expressive almond-shaped eyes. The dog is generally fiercely loyal and calm around the home, but can be aloof or wary around strangers along with a high prey drive.</p><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 25 to 29 inches (males); 23 to 27 inches (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 55 pounds (males); 33 to 44 pounds (females)</p><p>COAT: Short, fine coat, but the stomach may be hairless</p><p>COAT COLOR: A variety of colors include sand to dark red, white, black, blue, gray, brindle, grizzle, and all shades of brown, including chocolate.</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Refined, attentive, aloof, gentle, and playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: West Africa</p><h2>Characteristics of the Azawakh</h2><p>An Azawakh can sometimes become overly protective of its territory and humans if it feels threatened. Its reaction to strangers can vary from friendly, to uninterested, to wary, or aggressive. If this dog does take on the role of protector, it can be quite vocal too. Though protective, it isn't the best dog for small children. Since the Azawakh was not bred to be a companion, it may act aloof even with children within the family.</p><h2>History of the Azawakh</h2><p>The Azawakh is a sighthound originating from the West African Sahara Desert. It was first bred primarily to guard the livestock of nomadic pastoralist owners, particularly the Tuareg people. The breed was also highly regarded for its companionship and hunting skills, and often worked in packs. The dog's breeding means it's well adapted to living in the harsh desert climes.</p><p>The breed's name comes from the Azawakh Valley which lies in the desert between Mali and Niger, and it translates to ""Land of the North.""</p><p>In 1970, a Yugoslavian diplomat was gifted a male Azawakh from the nomadic people he had developed a relationship with, and then he also bartered to receive a female. This pair is believed to be the first of the breed to be exported.</p><p>Further dogs were then exported by French civil servants and military forces stationed in the region. They then began to be introduced across other parts of Europe and into the United States.</p><p>The breed is closely related to another African sighthound called the Sloughi and, when it was first exported, the dog was referred to as the Sloughi-Azawakh. In 1980, the breed became recognized solely as Azawakhs.</p><p>It was only recognized as an official breed by the American Kennel Club in 2011 and it's still relatively rare outside of their native Sahel region.</p><h2>Azawakh Care</h2><p>Azawakh are known for being intelligent, affectionate, and exceptionally loyal to their family members. They are still often independent in spirit, though. They are probably not the best dog for novice owners. Their unique personalities mean they can require a lot of additional training.</p><p>Their hunting instincts mean that they can have a high prey drive. Although they can get on well with cats, careful introductions should be made to ensure their chase instincts are not triggered.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like some other sighthounds, they can be referred to as speedy couch potatoes. Providing they get enough daily exercise, and the opportunity to release some of their energy, they will often then be happy to laze around on the couch. A good run in a fence-enclosed yard and brisk walk, totaling about an hour a day, will be sufficient to wear out your Azawakh. This breed's stamina also makes it a great running companion.</p><p>The Azawakh's thin coat, minimal body fat, and desert origins mean it doesn't like the cold. In the winter months, you will need to make sure your dog is kept warm on walks.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The breed has low-maintenance and basic grooming requirements. Its coat will only need a rub down around once a week to keep it shiny and in good condition.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Early and appropriate socialization, and ongoing positive reinforcement training around new people will be important to help your dog avoid developing an extreme reaction to strangers. You may have to work extra hard to achieve a solid recall if your pet is driven to chase. You should not allow an Azawakh off-leash in open spaces until you have achieved this difficult feat.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Azawakh is regarded as a generally healthy and robust breed. Given the rarity of this breed, though, means there is a small gene pool. You should find a breeder that carries out health tests on parents to minimize the chances of your puppy developing an inheritable condition.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It is important to feed any dog high quality food and an appropriately portion-controlled diet. The breed is naturally very slim, and there can be a tendency to overfeed them to try to fatten them up. Just because you can see the dog's ribs, it does not mean that your Azawakh is underweight. If you overfeed this breed, it can lead to obesity. This can result in a whole host of further help problems, and it can put a strain on the dog's delicate joints. If in doubt, it is worth seeking advice from your veterinarian.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Azawakh</h2><p>As with any dog, if you are buying a puppy, you should do your research and find a quality breeder. Always make sure that you can see mom and puppies together in a secure home environment. The puppies should not be released to their new homes until they are at least eight weeks old and fully weaned.</p><p>Because of the scarcity of the Azawakh breed, you may need to be on a waiting list, or travel further afield to secure a puppy. If you are lucky enough to work with a quality breeder, expect to pay on average $3,000 for an Azawakh puppy.</p><h2>Azawakh Overview</h2><p>Very affectionate with their family members</p><p>Calm in the house if they are given enough exercise</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming regime</p><p>Can be aloof, even wary around strangers</p><p>Can be territorial and prone to barking</p><p>Can have a high chase instinct</p>",988

It's known for its alert and rectangular body, erect tail, wiry reddish coat, and V-shaped ears that fold in half and flop forward. If you are looking for a dog that has boundless energy, will be devoted to its family, and is playful, adaptable, and up for anything, you may find your perfect partner in an Irish terrier.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 18 to 20 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 25 to 28 pounds</p><p>COAT: Dense, wiry, broken, close-lying topcoat, with a fine and soft undercoat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid colors which include bright red, golden red, red wheaten, or wheaten</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, lively, protective, trainable, dominant, respectful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Ireland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Irish Terrier</h2><p>Irish terriers have bags of charm and character. They are brave, energetic, and determined, and tend to be very people-orientated. This will not be a breed for everyone, though. They don't always get on well with other animals, can be very strong-willed, and can get easily bored if not given the right exercise and enrichment.</p><h2>History of the Irish Terrier</h2><p>It's not known how far back the history of the Irish terrier really goes, although they are thought to be one of the oldest of the terrier breeds. As with many terriers, they are likely descended from the old, now extinct black and tan terrier. What is known, though, is that they gained popularity because of their adaptability, bravery, and work ethic. Old Irish manuscripts stated that the Irish terrier was the""poor man's sentinel, the farmers' friend, and the gentleman's favorite.""</p><p>The breed was used in the country farms and estates in Ireland for hundreds of years. Their all-purpose nature meant they were unflinching ratters, loyal watchdogs, guardians of livestock, and even hunting companions.</p><p>Their coarse, wiry coat helped to keep them warm in the Irish countryside that plays host to some harsh weather conditions.</p><p>By the 1870s, a dog resembling the Irish terrier we know today was starting to emerge, and one which was only found in the solid red color they are known for.</p><p>In the late 19th century their popularity began to grow and the first Irish terriers were imported to the United States. They received official recognition from the American Kennel Club in 1885.</p><p>The Irish terriers' loyalty and tenacity meant they were selected to deliver messages, act as sentinels, and rid camps of vermin during World War I. Their renowned bravery earned them the nickname of ""daredevils.""</p><p>After World War II, the breeding of Irish terriers slowed dramatically and their popularity dipped. To this day, though, the breed has a devoted following who fall for their feisty, independent, dynamic, and loyal characteristics.</p><h2>Irish Terrier Care</h2><p>Their energy levels and their intelligence means they need to be kept busy and, along with a decent amount of daily exercise, you will also need to make sure you offer enough mental enrichment around the home. Stocking up on good interactive toys and incorporating short training sessions into their daily routine will help to keep the boredom at bay and prevent problem behaviors from surfacing as a result.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>If you love the great outdoors and head out hiking or running in all weather conditions, then an Irish terrier is probably going to be a game companion. This is not a breed that will be content with a couple of quick walks around the block to your local park. Give an Irish terrier at vigorous daily walk of at least 30 minutes. They have boundless energy and stamina and, with the right direction, they can excel at dog sports like agility and can make great canicross partners.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Irish terrier has low-maintenance, basic grooming needs. Their short, coarse coat sheds minimally and a weekly brush out should be enough to keep it healthy.</p><p>To keep the coat tidy, most Irish terrier owners have them hand-stripped (removal of dead hairs by hand) a few times a year. This is a tricky technique and it is usually best to seek the assistance of a gentle and qualified groomer for this job.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>You will need to work hard on their recall skills. They may have to remain on the leash in areas where there are lots of squirrels or rabbits.</p><p>Irish terriers can make great watchdogs, but don't let their alert barking get out of control. You also don't want them to start guarding when you are welcoming visitors.</p><p>When it comes to training, the breed is very smart, but the dog is also incredibly strong-willed. Trying to force an Irish terrier to do something it doesn't want to is not likely to have good results, and it certainly won't help to strengthen your bond.</p><p>They respond well to positive reinforcement and they pick things up quickly because they are so clever. To keep their interest, keep training sessions short, varied, fun, and motivating, and you will likely see great results.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Irish terriers, like a lot of the hardy terrier breeds, are considered to be generally healthy and robust.</p><p>Finding a breeder that performs health checks on prospective parents will minimize the chance of you selecting a dog that will develop genetic health conditions. Being aware of what some of these conditions are, though, can still be helpful.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It is important to feed your Irish terrier a high-quality dog food. You should also make sure you are careful with the portions you feed and how many additional treats it receives, to prevent your terrier from becoming overweight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Irish Terrier</h2><p>You should always do your research before buying a puppy. Finding a reputable breeder that provides a nurturing home environment for the mom and pups is vital in terms of health and early socialization. Depending on the dog's lineage, expect to pay a breeder between $800 to $3,700 for an Irish terrier puppy.</p><p>Getting in touch with the Irish Terrier Club of America (ITCA) would be a good place to start your explorations.</p><p>You could also consider adopting an Irish terrier. It can be a hugely rewarding experience. The ITCA has a rescue arm, or you could reach out to your local rescue shelter. They may not have any Irish terriers, but there will certainly be lots of other characterful terriers looking for forever homes.</p><h2>Irish Terrier Overview</h2><p>Very people-orientated and loyal</p><p>Clever and courageous</p><p>Athletic and well-suited to an active owner</p><p>Can have a very high prey drive</p><p>Doesn't always get along with other dogs</p><p>Strong-willed and stubborn</p>",1067

Known for its low-set body, large erect ears, and stubby tail, the Pembroke also has a reputation for being a wonderful companion. Pembroke Welsh corgis are achondroplastic, a dwarf breed with shortened legs. They are the shortest breed of the herding dog group.</p><p>This breed and the Cardigan Welsh corgi are often confused, despite the fact that the two are separate breeds. Pembrokes have slightly smaller builds than Cardigans, their ears are pointier, and they have short stubby tails, as opposed to the long tail of the Cardigan.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn All About the Loyal Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h3><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 24 to 30 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black and tan, red, sable, or fawn (all colors are typically seen with white markings)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Friendly, outgoing, playful, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Wales</p><h2>Characteristics of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2><p>Pembroke Welsh corgis are very intelligent, active, and loyal. Pembrokes tend to be good with other dogs and cats that are part of their household, especially if they were raised together. However, they can be territorial around other dogs and cats as the breed was developed to drive off strange dogs around the flocks. This might lead to aggression at the dog park or against animals that enter your yard.</p><h2>History of the Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2><p>Theories regarding the Pembroke Welsh corgi's origin vary among experts, but it is generally believed that the breed dates back to around the 10th century. One theory is that the breed's ancestors were brought to Wales by Flemish weavers. Another theory suggests they may have descended from Swedish Vallhund. Either way, they have been part of life in Wales for more than 1,000 years.</p><p>Pembrokes were developed in Wales where they were used as herding, companion, and/or guard dogs. There are obvious similarities between Pembroke and Cardigan Welsh corgis, and these breeds were actually crossed in the past. In 1934, the two were officially recognized by the English Kennel Club and the American Kennel Club (AKC) as separate breeds.</p><p>You may be familiar with the pet corgis kept by Queen Elizabeth II. She has been a Pembroke Welsh corgi owner since her father gave her one in 1933. They hold a special place at Buckingham Palace.</p><p>Some Pembrokes are born with only a stub of a tail. Traditionally, Pembroke Welsh corgis had their tails docked, as this would show the dog was a working dog and exempt from taxation as a pet dog. Docking is not required for show dogs in the U.K. but the AKC standard says tails should be docked no longer than 2 inches. Docking is illegal in many countries.</p><h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi Care</h2><p>Pembroke Welsh corgis can be excellent, loyal, and happy companions for the right household, as long as their exercise, grooming, and training needs are met. Too much unreleased energy and a lack of training can lead to excessive barking and other behavior problems.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Intelligent and hard-working, the Pembroke excels at herding and most dog sports. This breed requires plenty of exercise on a regular basis, which means a minimum of one hour a day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Pembroke Welsh corgi has a medium-length topcoat with a short undercoat. The breed tends to shed a significant amount, both daily and seasonally in the spring and fall. Routine grooming is essential and mainly consists of hair brushing once or twice a week and as much as daily during shedding seasons. Bathing may help control the shedding.</p><p>Be sure to trim your dog's nails regularly to prevent tears and foot problems. Help your dog keep its teeth and gums healthy by brushing teeth daily or at least a couple of times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Early socialization is good for corgis as they tend to be naturally reserved around strangers. This trait makes them good watchdogs, but excessive fearfulness needs to be avoided. Because the Pembroke craves activities and challenges, training is an absolute must. Start with the basics, then consider training the dog to do a job, such as a watchdog or a herder.</p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Help protect your corgi's spinal health, as they won't be able to climb and jump up on furniture as easily as dogs with longer legs. This can result in back strain or fractures. You may want to provide steps and ramps if your dog wants to get up and down from any height.</p><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. Some hereditary health problems can occur in the corgi breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your Pembroke will need two meals a day. The amount will depend on the dog's size, activity level, age, and other factors. It's best not to leave food out for free-feeding throughout the day, as this breed tends to put on weight. Obesity will shorten your dog's life and predispose it to other health conditions. Be sure to monitor your dog's weight and discuss it with your veterinarian. Ask for recommendations for a feeding schedule, amount, type of food, and exercise that will help keep your dog healthy.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2><p>Before bringing a Pembroke Welsh corgi into your home, it helps to have experience with how to patiently handle a strong-willed and independent pup. This breed may be tough to find and adopt from a shelter, but there are Pembroke Welsh corgi breeders located around the country. To adopt a dog of this breed, find a local breeder near you or contact a national organization that may be able to locate a rescue.</p><h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi Overview</h2><p>Rich breed history and royal association</p><p>Good family pet</p><p>Intelligent and hardworking</p><p>Daily shedding</p><p>Potential for back problems</p><p>Can easily become overweight</p>",967

For thousands of years, this breed served as the hunting hound of kings and today these dogs remain fast, agile sprinters who love a good chase or romp outdoors, while at the same time making gentle and loyal pets with warm, faithful eyes, and undying devotion to their families.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound Group</p><p>HEIGHT: 23 to 28 inches (male), females tend to be smaller</p><p>WEIGHT: 40 to 65 pounds</p><p>COAT: Feathered or smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: White or cream, fawn, black and tan or grizzle and tan, golden </p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 17 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Aloof, intelligent, reserved, quiet</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Egypt</p><h2>Characteristics of the Saluki</h2><p>These beautiful dogs are known to be both reserved and affectionate and offer companionship to their families. While the Saluki isn't overly demonstrative, it will form deep bonds with its humans and it is susceptible to separation anxiety when left alone for long periods.</p><h2>History of the Saluki</h2><p>As strong, balanced athletes, Salukis have long been revered throughout history for their grace and beauty. Historically referred to as the Persian greyhound, the gazelle hound, or even the ""wind drinker,"" the breed's ancient history can be difficult to trace. However, experts believe the roots of the Saluki breed might extend as far back as 7000 BC.</p><p>Once considered the royal dog of Egypt (as it's sometimes still called), some historians have suggested that the Saluki is actually the oldest dog breed and that their origins may trace back to 329 BC when Alexander the Great invaded China. There are depictions of dogs resembling Salukis that appear on Egyptian tombs dating 4,000 years ago, and carvings from the Sumerian empire that also feature dogs with a strong resemblance to the Saluki.</p><p>The Saluki and other sighthounds were the favorite pets among kings like Egyptian pharaohs as well as other notable historical figures like Alexander the Great, and are believed to have originated in the Middle East, Egypt, and Asia long before the Egyptian pyramids were built. Some historians believe the breed may take its name from the ancient city of Saluk in Yemen, or possibly from the city of Seleucia in Syria.</p><p>Particularly widespread throughout Egypt, these dogs were revered and cherished. In fact, their bodies were often mummified just like those of the ancient pharaohs. Nomadic Muslims, who generally considered dogs to be unclean animals, considered Salukis a gift from Allah.</p><p>The Saluki's first known presence in England dates back to 1840. The breed wasn't established until after World War I when many British officers returned from the Middle East with these dogs. Today's Saluki remains true to its ancient ancestors, from its sleek physique and warm eyes to its sophisticated and dignified persona.</p><p>The Saluki breed was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1927.</p><h2>Saluki Care</h2><p>The Saluki dog breed's high need for activity means it will not do well living in an apartment and without plenty of walks (or runs) and time spent outdoors. Thanks to its speed and natural inclination to chase and hunt deer, squirrels, or any other wildlife, a strong leash, attentive owner, and safe, enclosed places to roam outdoors are must-haves for this breed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>With a long history of running and tracking animals, this breed makes an ideal pet for runners or active families. The Saluki will require daily exercise and walks, totaling two hours a day, for both its physical and mental wellbeing.</p><p>Salukis should ideally live in a home with a large fenced-in yard for their safety. Without the proper exercise and stimulation (lots of playtime and plenty of safe toys and bones to chew), Salukis are known to be adept at either escaping or becoming destructive.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Salukis can have either a feathered or smooth coat but either coat will require weekly brushing though they shed less than other breeds. The breed is known for being a clean dog that's free from most typical canine odors, requiring infrequent bathing. Saluki owners should be mindful about keeping this dog's long ears and tail clean try to keep its ears outside of the dog's bowl while it's eating and watch for any stuck or lingering dirt on the tip of its tail after a romp.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Considered an independent (and sometimes aloof) breed, many Saluki dogs will prove somewhat difficult to train they like to think for themselves and may need more persuasion than other breeds. However, like most dogs, most Salukis should respond well to positive reinforcements like treats and praise.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Salukis are known to be free from many common genetic diseases, and generally can be expected to enjoy a healthy, active life through old age. However, there are a few breed-specific conditions that may affect this dog.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Saluki should perform well on any high-quality complete and balanced dog food. The appetite for this breed is known to vary greatly from dog to dog some dogs in this breed are known to be picky eaters so owners of Salukis with increased appetites should be mindful about overfeeding to prevent weight gain and related issues. Fresh water should be made available at all times to this large, active breed.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Saluki</h2><p>Saluki dogs are rare in the U.S., however there may be more available puppies and rescues overseas in the Middle East.

It's known for its simply adorable bright eyes, foxy-looking face with alert pricked ears, and square body. These mischievous little rascals are extra busy, always wanting to be part of the action. Schipperkes are full of energy and are lots of fun to be around.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting </p><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 13 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 10 to 16 pounds</p><p>COAT: Abundant, straight, and slightly harsh to the touch</p><p>COAT COLOR: Solid black coat; shades of cream, ivory, wheaten, gold, red, white, blue, and chocolate do occur rarely</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Curious, faithful, playful, fearless, agile, independent, confident</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Belgium</p><h2>Characteristics of the Schipperke</h2><p>Schipperkes might get along with other family pets if raised with them, but some might not want to be friends with strange pets. Schipperkes are born to chase, so they are not safe around small pets like hamsters, rabbits, and birds, and some might bother the family cat. Excellent watchdogs, schipperkes are naturally suspicious of strangers and protective of their home territory.</p><h2>History of the Schipperke</h2><p>The feisty and fun schipperke has been known in Belgium since medieval times. Though the schipperke is sometimes described as a spitz because of its appearance, it actually the descendant of the now-extinct black sheepdog, called the Leauvenaar (from which the Belgian sheepdog also descends).</p><p>The quintessential boat dog, schipperkes worked on and around ships and barges, keeping the rat populations down and acting as watchdogs. In fact, their name, ""schipperke,"" means ""little captain"" in Flemish. Today, schipperkes are still known for their love of boats and water. Although the proper pronunciation of the breed's name is ""SHEEP-er-ker,"" you might more commonly hear it pronounced ""SKIP-er-kee,"" especially in the United States. </p><p>The schipperke is one of the smallest members of the American Kennel Club Non-Sporting Group, a catchall group for many diverse breeds that don't quite fit into the other six groups (Herding, Hound, Sporting, Terrier, Toy, and Working). Schipperkes first came to the U.S. in the late 1800s. The national club representing the breed in the United States, the Schipperke Club of America, was founded in 1929.</p><h2>Schipperke Care</h2><p>The curious, adventurous schipperke is a known escape artist, and should never be trusted off leash. A fenced yard is a must, and fences should be well kept with no small holes to escape through. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Schipperkes have a lot of energy and are very playful. Luckily, the breed is small, so it's not difficult to provide enough exercise to keep a schipperke happy. Two brisk walks a day totaling 30 minutes will typically suffice, although your schipperke might be up for more adventure.</p><p>A schipperke loves to swim since it was bred to be around water. Games of fetch in the yard or even in the house are also a great way to entertain and exercise the fun-loving schipperke. This breed also loves to play with toys. Small stuffed toys will likely lose their squeakers quickly, but the schipperke will have so much fun dispatching the ""vermin."" </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The schipperke's glossy black coat is easy to care for, requiring only weekly brushing to remove loose hair. The coat does not mat, but the schipperke does shed a fair amount. You might notice heavier shedding seasonally. During these times brushing more frequently will help cut down on the amount of hair you find in the house and on your clothes.</p><p>The breed's coat is shorter on the face and front of the legs, medium length on the body, and longer around the neck and back of the legs. The schipperke coat requires no trimming; just bathing with gentle moisturizing pet shampoo, then towel dry or blow dry the coat, and your schipperke will shine.</p><p>Brush your schipperke's teeth daily with a soft toothbrush and pet-safe toothpaste. Never use human toothpaste for a dog. Pet toothpaste is designed to be swallowed and comes in dog-approved flavors like poultry and beef. Trim your schipperke's nails every few weeks and look inside their ears, cleaning the ears as needed with a pet-safe ear cleaner and cotton balls or gauze squares. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Schipperkes are smart, but they are also independent, and can be challenging to train. Keep training fun and positive, using lots of tasty treats. With the right motivation, schipperkes can learn not only basic obedience commands but also fun tricks, too. Like all puppies, schipperkes benefit from early and frequent training and socialization. Puppy kindergarten and basic obedience group classes will provide your schipperke with socialization opportunities while teaching you the basics of dog training. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Schipperkes are generally quite healthy and long-lived. Responsible breeders test their adult schipperkes for genetic conditions before breeding them to avoid passing on these problems. When buying a schipperke puppy from a breeder, ask to see proof that the appropriate tests were performed on the puppy's parents. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your adult schipperke measured meals twice a day (puppies should eat three or four small meals per day). Always use a measuring cup or scale to ensure you are feeding the correct amounts. Not measuring meals or leaving food out all day (free feeding) can cause weight gain, which can contribute to health problems like diabetes.</p><p>Because schipperkes are small, they might benefit from eating a small breed diet formulated to meet the unique caloric needs of smaller breeds. Talk to your veterinarian or breeder if you're not sure what kind of food to feed or how much to feed your schipperke.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Schipperke</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and rescue groups for schipperkes in need of homes. Always do your due diligence and research to find the very best quality breeder if you go that route. If you choose to work with a breeder, expect to pay between $1,000 up to $2,500 or more for a schipperke puppy.</p><h2>Schipperke Overview</h2><p>Energetic, adorable, and playful</p><p>Excellent watchdog</p><p>Athletic and agile</p><p>High prey instincts around small animals</p><p>Excessive, loud barker</p><p>Impulsive off leash</p>",979

Called the  (Norwegian for ""forest cat"") in its native country, the Norwegian forest cat is sometimes given the nickname ""wegie"" in the United States. This large, wild-looking cat has a dense, long coat and furry ears with lynx tips (tufts of hair growing on the tips of the ears). It will form strong bonds with its human family but usually prefers to occupy its own space rather than anyone's lap.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Wegie,</p><p>Personality: Friendly and interactive but independent and adventurous</p><p>Weight: Up to 18 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 36 inches, nose to tail</p><p>Coat Length: Long hair with a dense undercoat</p><p>Coat Colors: Almost any color or pattern with or without white markings; disqualifying colors are chocolate, lavender/lilac, or the Himalayan pattern</p><p>Coat Patterns: Most patterns except colorpoint; tabby is common</p><p>Eye Color: Shades of green, gold, green-gold, copper, or blue (in white or partially white cats)</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 16 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Norway</p><h2>Norwegian Forest Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Independent but affectionate, the Norwegian forest cat is not going to sleep on your lap all night, but it may hop up for a brief cuddle now and then. That isn't to say the Norwegian forest cat has a standoffish personality far from it. Norwegian forest cats are very attached to their humans and want to be involved in all aspects of family life. They just would rather be nearby rather than right on you.</p><p>Norwegian forest cats are curious, playful, and even-tempered, making them great companions for families with children. They are mellow enough to get along with respectful dogs and generally live happily with other cats, too.</p><h2>History of the Norwegian Forest Cat</h2><p>By the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, however, the breed was nearly lost due to indiscriminate cross-breeding with other types of cats. People took notice, recognizing that the breed was a national treasure. In 1938, Norway's King Olav V deemed the Norwegian forest cat the national cat breed of Norway. It took many decades, but breed fanciers in Norway eventually managed to save the breed and bolster its numbers through careful breeding programs. </p><p>The first Norwegian forest cats were imported into the United States in 1979. The Norwegian forest cat was accepted for championship status by The International Cat Association in 1984. The Cat Fanciers Association accepted the Norwegian forest cat for full championship status in 1993. </p><h2>Norwegian Forest Cat Care</h2><p>The dense coat of the Norwegian forest cat requires a thorough weekly brushing to keep tangles and mats at bay. Once a year in the spring, the Norwegian forest cat sheds most of its undercoat for the summer season when extra insulation is not needed. Shedding can be heavy during this seasonal transition, so brush more frequently. At all other times of the year, the Norwegian forest cat sheds moderately.</p><p>In addition to brushing, bathe your Norwegian Forest Cat every few months, keep the nails trimmed short and check the ears weekly, cleaning if necessary.</p><p>Norwegian forest cats are slow to mature, achieving full growth around five years of age. They are lively and playful well into adulthood, but they are not obsessively active. Norwegian forest cats appreciate fun toys and are usually up for a play session on their terms. Consider providing a cat tree or tower for climbing, perching, and scratching. Your cat will particularly appreciate its tree being situated near a window where it can contentedly watch squirrels and birds outside. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Any cat can develop health issues during its lifetime, but some pedigreed cats have known congenital issues that can be passed on to kittens. The Norwegian forest cat is prone to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, hip dysplasia, and glycogen storage disease type IV.</p><p>Reputable breeders monitor their adult cats' health and avoid breeding cats with potential health concerns. A genetic test is available for GSD IV to screen for cats that are carriers. Most good breeders also usually offer a health guarantee.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Norwegian forest cat looks as if it would be at home in the wilds of the forest. It is large yet well-balanced and solidly muscled with substantial bone structure. It has a broad chest and considerable girth, but the cat should never appear fat.</p><p>The back legs are somewhat longer than the front legs, so the Norwegian forest cat's rump is slightly higher than its shoulders. The breed's medium to large ears are wide at the base and rounded at the tips and heavily furred. Lynx tips (tufts at the tips of the ears) are a highly desirable characteristic of the breed.  </p><p>The Norwegian forest cat has a specialized double coat to keep the cat warm during the harsh winters in Scandinavia. The longer, coarse, water-resistant outer coat forms a ruff at the chest, a collar at the neck, britches on the rear legs, a bushy tail, and heavy tufting between the toes. A short, dense undercoat provides warm insulation from the cold. </p><p>The cat's coat comes in a rainbow of colors, shades, and patterns, including solid, bi-color, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, cameo, and smoke. The only colors that are disallowed by the breed standard are those that indicate hybridization chocolate, sable, lavender, lilac, cinnamon, fawn, or Himalayan-type markings, or any of these colors with white.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Norwegian forest cats are sturdily built but should never become fat. Keeping your Norwegian forest cat lean is the best way to prevent weight-related health issues, including diabetes, heart disease, and hip dysplasia, which can be compounded by excess weight.</p><p>Feed your Norwegian forest cat measured amounts of food at least twice a day. Don't leave food out all day; free-fed cats tend to snack more than necessary, which can lead to excess weight gain. Ask your veterinarian or breeder for advice about healthy food for your Norwegian forest cat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Norwegian Forest Cat</h2><p>Both the Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association publish lists of active Norwegian forest cat breeders on their respective websites. A great way to meet breeders and view cats of many different breeds is by checking out a local cat show.</p><p>A Norwegian forest cat might end up in an animal shelter or with a cat private rescue group. Pedigreed cats in need of re-homing are often placed into new adoptive homes by caring breeders. </p><h2>Norwegian Forest Cat Overview</h2><p>These big, beautiful cats are the perfect pets for families that love companionship but don't need constant physical contact with their cats. Norwegian forest cats are eager to be close and interact by playing or just observing, but they prefer not to be picked up all the time. Their dense coats require more care than shorter-haired breeds, and they are prone to certain health conditions, but these cats are well worth the effort.</p><p>Friendly with people and pets </p><p>Can tolerate cold temperatures<br/></p><p>Laid-back and adaptable personality<br/></p><p>Not a lap cat</p><p>Coat needs brushing at least weekly</p><p>Doesn't like being left alone for long</p>",1129

It's known for its large flattened face, wide-set eyes with that look of perpetual astonishment, and long floppy, feathered ears. The breed was actually thought to originate in China before becoming popular in Japan.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 8 to 11 inches (to the withers)<br/></p><p>WEIGHT: 4 to 9 pounds<br/></p><p>COAT: Long, sleek and smooth coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Colors include black and white, lemon and white, sable and white, and black, white and tan.<br/></p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Alert, loyal, loving, independent, intelligent</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: China (or possibly Korea)</p><h2>Characteristics of the Japanese Chin</h2><p>The Japanese chin is known for being even-tempered, loyal, and affectionate. It's often described as a ""cat-like"" dog, and can be fond of curling up on its owner's lap. While it can be reserved with new people and pets, it is generally an incredibly social and very loyal companion when introductions are done appropriately.</p><h2>History of the Japanese Chin</h2><p>There is no doubting the longevity and aristocratic background of the Japanese chin, but their earliest introductions are still debated amongst historians.</p><p>While they are believed to have originated in China (or possibly even Korea), it is widely recognized that it was the Japanese nobility that nurtured the highly-prized companion breed from perhaps as far back as 1000 years ago.</p><p>By the middle of the 19th century, when Japan began actively trading with other countries after over two centuries of self-imposed seclusion, the Japanese chin was often offered as a highly prized gift to naval officers or sold to visiting traders and sailors. This led to their gradual introduction in Western countries.</p><p>When future King Edward VII of Great Britain married his wife Alexandra in 1863, she received a Japanese chin as a gift, and she became a lifelong lover of the breed, helping them to gain popularity in Great Britain and America.</p><p>The breed was first recognized by the AKC in 1888 and is often also referred to as a Japanese spaniel. The Japanese chin is closely related to the Pekingese.</p><h2>Japanese Chin Care</h2><p>Caring for this breed can be somewhat low-maintenance. It is not known for being one of the most active breeds but it is still important that your dog receives an appropriate amount of exercise. While the Japanese chin has a long, smooth, soft, and glossy coat, it is not as challenging to maintain as other long-haired breeds.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Just because the Japanese chin may enjoy snuggling on a lap, it doesn't mean it won't also relish a nicely paced walk, too. Walk your dog once or twice a day at a leisurely pace for 15 minutes at a stretch. This dog does not have endurance so it's best to leave your pup home when hiking or jogging.</p><p>But because it is classed as a flat-faced/brachycephalic breed, care must be taken to keep the dog comfortable in hot weather, especially when exercising. Because of its short snout, the Japanese chin can be more prone to heat intolerance and heat strokes, which can be exacerbated by breathing difficulties, so extra vigilance is required in warmer temperatures. Using a harness, rather than just a collar and leash, can take the strain away from its delicate neck area.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Japanese chin's coat does not tend to mat, but it's best to regularly attend to it so it does not tangle. It is recommended that the dog's coat is brushed out at least weekly though and this is especially important when it goes through its seasonal shedding. The dog's coat will not require any clipping or scissoring.</p><p>The breed is known for having nails that grow very quickly, so it is important to ensure that your dog's nails are always kept trimmed to an appropriate length.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The chin is an intelligent breed but they can have a reputation for being stubborn, so a little patience and extra perseverance may be required when it comes to training. Many owners of this breed potty train their Japanese chin. You can toilet train this breed at any age though it is best done when the puppy is between eight and 12 weeks old.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Japanese chin is a relatively healthy breed, but it can be prone to a few congenital conditions, Good breeders health screen potential parents to minimize the risk of inherited issues being passed on.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>While it can be easy to fall into the habit of free-feeding or spoiling with table scraps, the Japanese chin can be prone to obesity and it must be fed a healthy, high-quality diet that is appropriately portion controlled.</p><p>The amount fed will vary depending on the individual dog, their age, and activity levels.</p><p>A fresh and plentiful water source should always be available, and this is all the more important because of the breed's heat intolerance issues.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Japanese Chin</h2><p>If you are buying a Japanese chin puppy, it is incredibly important to do your research and seek out a reputable breeder. The breeder should perform the appropriate genetic health checks on the parents, and the puppies should have the best start, staying with mom in a nurturing home environment. Expect to pay $1,500 to $2,500 for a puppy.</p><p>While the breed is not a common one, it is possible to adopt a Japanese chin from a shelter or a breed-specific rescue. Dog adoption can be a hugely rewarding experience.</p><h2>Japanese Chin Overview</h2><p>Great companion, sociable and loyal</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>One of the quietest breeds</p><p>Strong-willed, independent requires patience during training</p><p>Cannot tolerate heat</p><p>Prone to obesity</p>",928

Also called a Pom, this breed is typically friendly but can be bossy at times. Still, it is extremely loyal to its loved ones and can be an effective guard dog despite its diminutive stature.</p><p>With proper training, the Pomeranian can make an excellent companion, though this dog is not for everyone. Families with young children might not be an ideal home for a Pom, but the breed often gets along well with older and calmer children.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 7 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Comes in many colors, though the most common are red, orange, cream, sable, black, brown, and blue</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Bold, alert, lively, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany/Poland</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Adorable and Loyal Pom</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Pomeranian</h2><p>Pomeranians generally have a bold and lively temperament. Their personality is much bigger than their diminutive size. They can act as alert watch dogs and tend to be affectionate with their owners. </p><h2>History of the Pomeranian</h2><p>The Pomeranian is a descendant of spitz-type sled dogs from Iceland and Lapland. Several hundred years ago, these predecessors to the Pom made their way to Pomerania, which is now parts of Poland and Germany. While there, breeders somewhat diminished the dogs' size. The modern Pom is the smallest spitz-type dog breed.</p><p>The Pomeranian's popularity rose when members of the British royal family took a liking to it. At that time, the breed was still larger than today's version. But in the late 1800s, Queen Victoria became a breeder and won a breed competition with a particularly small Pomeranian. After that, it became popular to breed the dogs even smaller. </p><p>Some notable Pomeranian owners throughout history include Marie Antoinette and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Two Pomeranians also were among the three dogs that survived the sinking of the Titanic in 1912.</p><p>The Pomeranian gained popularity in the United States around the turn of the 20th century and today remains a popular dog breed. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1888.</p><h2>Pomeranian Care</h2><p>Pomeranians need consistent training and regular exercise to be happy, healthy dogs. Their thick coat also requires a fair amount of upkeep. Plus, owners must be cautious about Pomeranians in hot weather, as well as with predators and any rough encounters with people or other pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Pomeranians have a medium energy level that shouldn't be underestimated just because they're small dogs. They should get at least an hour per day of physical activity, including walks and playing with toys. They also should have the chance to freely run around each day (and they don't need much space to do it). Moreover, puzzle toys can help to provide the mental stimulation that Poms need.</p><p>While Poms do fairly well in cold weather, their thick coat can cause them to overheat in hot weather. So even though they generally have good endurance, keep outside activity to short sessions in the heat. Also, be sure to protect your Pom from predators including large birds when outside. <br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Pomeranian has a long, thick double coat that requires frequent grooming. Plan to brush your Pom's coat at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Poms also typically go through heavier seasonal sheds as the weather changes in the fall and spring, during which you'll likely have to brush multiple times a week to keep up with the loose fur.</p><p>A bath with a thorough brushing will be required roughly every four to six weeks. At that time, you also should clean your dog's ears, and you might have to express its anal glands. A groomer or vet's office can do that for you if you're not comfortable with it at home. You'll also have to trim your dog's nails roughly every four to six weeks, especially if you hear them clicking on hard surfaces. And you should aim to brush its teeth ideally every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Pomeranians are moderately trainable dogs. While they are smart, they also can be stubborn. So consistency and patience are essential when training a Pom. Begin training and socialization early in puppyhood. Work on house-training right away, so your dog doesn't begin to develop any bad habits that are hard to break. Also, socialize puppies with different people and in various environments to help curb their tendency to bark at strangers. </p><p>Pomeranians can coexist with other household pets when given the proper training and socialization. But Poms generally won't back down from a fight, even with a larger dog. Plus, they can be injured in friendly but rough play. So make sure all household pets and people, especially young children are well-mannered and gentle to safely live together. </p><p>Furthermore, Pomeranians can hurt themselves when jumping on and off of furniture, including couches and beds. So it's important either to train them to use a ramp or teach them to stay off furniture. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Pomeranians are typically healthy dogs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The tiny Pomeranian requires a small amount of food compared to larger breeds. It's common to feed two meals per day of a nutritionally balanced quality dog food. How much food your dog requires will depend on its size, activity level, and other factors. Discuss dietary needs with your veterinarian, and consistently monitor your pet's weight. Even a weight fluctuation of 1 pound is significant for these little dogs. Also, make sure your dog always has access to fresh water, especially in hot weather and during exercise.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pomeranian</h2><p>If you're interested in acquiring a Pomeranian, check your local animal shelter and breed-specific rescue groups for dogs in need of homes. Be sure you have the time and energy to devote to training and caring for a dog that can sometimes be stubborn and vocal. Expect to pay around $1,000 or more for a puppy, though this price can vary widely for older dogs and adoptable dogs.</p><p>There are several organizations that can help you locate a reputable breeder or rescue, including:  </p><h2>Pomeranian Overview</h2><p>Good guard dog</p><p>Can adapt well to small homes</p><p>Lively and loyal</p><p>Sensitive to heat</p><p>Not the best for small children</p><p>Can be stubborn and loud</p>",1030

While there is inaccurate stigma against pit bull-type dogs for being aggressive, American pit bull terriers are generally loyal dogs that love people. However, they don't always get along with other dogs and might view smaller animals as prey.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 20 inches (female), 18 to 21 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 30 to 50 pounds (female), 35 to 60 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, white, brindle, fawn, blue, red, brown, tan, gray</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, affectionate, courageous</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the American Pit Bull Terrier</h2><p>American pit bull terriers generally have a friendly and affectionate personality. They also usually have a very playful temperament and love to engage in games and dog sports with their humans. They also tend to take well to training.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Affectionate American Pit Bull</h3><h2>History of the American Pit Bull Terrier</h2><p>The modern American pit bull terrier can trace its roots back to England in the early 19th century. Breeders crossed bulldogs and terriers to create spirited, courageous, and athletic dogs that were gentle with their family. They became multipurpose working dogs driving livestock, going on hunts, protecting property, and engaging in other duties. Plus, they were family companions. They also sadly were used for inhumane blood sports, such as bull baiting and dog fighting, which is why they are still unfairly stereotyped as aggressive and even banned in some areas. </p><p>The breed arrived in the United States in the mid-1800s where it was further refined. And in 1898, the United Kennel Club formed with the American pit bull terrier as the first breed on its registry its founder's own dog.</p><p>Throughout the 1900s and to modern day, American pit bull terriers filled many roles in society. Besides being companion dogs, they also can make excellent service and therapy dogs, police and military dogs, search-and-rescue dogs, and more. The American Kennel Club has not yet recognized the breed.</p><h2>American Pit Bull Terrier Care</h2><p>American pit bull terriers need sufficient physical activity every day to help prevent problem behaviors from developing. Proper training and socialization also are a must to make your dog a good breed ambassador, as the breed is often wrongfully stereotyped as having poor manners and being unruly. Fortunately, grooming is a fairly easy task for this breed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Because this is an athletic breed, exercise is very important. Provide at least an hour per day of physical activity, such as brisk walks, jogging, hiking, and fetch. Dog sports also can be good mental and physical challenges for an American pit bull terrier. Without a proper outlet for all that energy, a pit bull might become destructive, hyperactive, or develop other behavior problems. Furthermore, these dogs often like to chew and have powerful jaws, so be sure to provide durable chew toys.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The short, smooth coat of the American pit bull terrier requires little more than basic grooming. Brush weekly to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. You might notice an uptick in shedding in the spring and fall as the weather changes. An extra brushing each week can help to keep up with the loose fur.</p><p>Baths will be necessary roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. You also can clean your dog between baths with a damp towel. Check nails monthly to see whether they need a trim. And look in your dog's ears at least weekly for any wax buildup, debris, redness, or other abnormalities. Also, aim to brush your dog's teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>As with any dog breed, proper training and socialization are a must for an American pit bull terrier. Start as young as possible with your dog. There is extra pressure on this breed to be well-behaved to help quell the negative stereotypes. Animal professionals often recommend that American pit bull terriers complete the Canine Good Citizen certification to learn how to be calm and well-mannered in a variety of situations.</p><p>In general, this is a fairly smart and trainable dog breed that responds well to positive training methods. But it can be stubborn if you're not consistent with your commands. <br/></p><p>It's also important to expose your dogs to a variety of people and situations in a positive manner to teach it to be comfortable and confident. While some pit bulls can learn to coexist peacefully with other household pets, socialization can be difficult due to the breed's strong prey drive and history of dog fighting. Always walk your dog on leash, and supervise it around other dogs. These dogs might not start a fight, but they often don't back down once challenged.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet, typically in two measured meals per day. Discuss the type of diet and the quantity with your vet, as this can vary depending on size, activity level, age, and other factors.</p><p>Also, be mindful of treats and other extra food to help prevent overeating. Many American pit bull terriers are food-motivated and will beg and/or perform tricks for a treat.

Despite their delicate appearance and relatively small size, however, Turkish Angoras are affectionate and playful with their owners, children, and other pets (as long as the other pets know that the Angora is the boss).</p><p>A natural breed that originated in Turkey as early as the 15th century, Turkish Angoras were long considered to be solid white cats with blue or green eyes. Today, however, it's widely accepted that Turkish Angoras can come in a variety of colors and variations, including Himalayan, calico, tortoiseshell, and tabby.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Ankara cat</p><p>Personality: Playful, social, intelligent, mischievous, and occasionally bossy with other pets</p><p>Weight: Up to 9 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Long Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: White with lavender, chocolate</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby, solid, bicolor, Himalayan, calico, tortoiseshell, and colorpoint</p><p>Eye Color: Light blue, sapphire, emerald, green-gold, gold, amber, copper, or two different colors</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Turkey</p><h2>Turkish Angora Characteristics</h2><p>A Turkish Angoras has a friendly and sociable personality, so it thrives in a home with lots of love and attention. Compared to other cats, the Turkish angora is somewhat needy and doesn't like to be left alone. It appreciates the constant company of its owner or other pets.</p><p>Turkish Angoras also have a lot of energy and can get into mischief especially when bored. Opening cabinets, turning on faucets, or knocking things off tables are just a sampling of the orneriness an Angoras might exhibit when it wants a little more attention.<br/></p><h2>History of the Turkish Angora</h2><p>Unlike many ""man-made"" cat breeds, the Turkish Angora is a naturally occurring breed that originated in Turkey sometime during the 15th century. It is believed that the angora is a descendant of the African wildcat and that its long, silky hair is either the result of a spontaneous mutation or an evolutionary adaptation to the harsh, snowy climates in Ankara (formerly Angora).</p><p>Legends trace Turkish Angoras back to Mohammad, founder of the Islamic faith, who adored cats, and once cut off his sleeve to avoid disrupting the tabby-patterned Turkish Angora sleeping in his arms.</p><p>The earliest written reference to Turkish Angora cats dates back to 16th century France, so it's commonly accepted that Turkish Angoras began moving into Britain and France during the late 15th century. By the 1700s, Turkish Angoras were imported to the Americas.</p><p>Turkish Angoras were exhibited at some of the first cat shows in the late 19th century, and Persian breeds began to incorporate them into their breeding programs. This, unfortunately, caused Turkish angora populations to dwindle throughout Europe. In response, Turkish Angoras became the ""treasures"" of Turkey, and a breeding program was established at the Ankara Zoo to preserve them.</p><p>During the 1950s, American servicemen stationed in Turkey were captivated by the zoo's Turkish Angoras. Although the breeding program was hesitant to give up any of its cats, two were gifted to Colonel and Mrs. Walter Grant. These cats became the foundation of the American Turkish angora breeding program. Over the years, more Americans brought Turkish angoras home and propagated the breed through the United States.</p><p>The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) began to accept white Turkish Angoras in 1968, but colored varieties weren't registered until 1978. Today, Turkish Angoras are also recognized by the International Cat Fanciers Association.</p><h2>Turkish Angora Care</h2><p>Despite the Turkish Angora's delicate, luxurious appearance, grooming is relatively simple. Because Turkish angoras have a single coat, they're far less prone to tangles and matting. Simply brush your cat's coat once per week to remove debris, and bathe as needed. Fortunately, many Turkish Angoras water and are natural swimmers, so bath time may not be as challenging as you'd imagine.</p><p>Like all cats, your Turkish Angora may be susceptible to periodontal disease if proper dental hygiene isn't practiced. Daily brushing is ideal, but brushing weekly will offer your cat some protection.</p><p>Be sure to check your cat's ears weekly for dirt, debris, or signs of infection. If your cat's ears are dirty, gently clean the ears with a soft, cotton cloth. Avoid ear swabs, as they can damage the delicate, inner-ear structures.</p><p>Because the Turkish Angora has higher energy levels, you should plan to exercise your cat for 15 to 30 minutes each day. Playing with cat toys is a fun, easy way to help your Turkish Angora expend some energy.</p><p>Keeping your Angora indoors at all times is highly recommended for safety.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Turkish Angora is a generally healthy cat, but white Angoras with one or two blue eyes are prone to deafness in one or both ears.</p><p>Whether your cat is pedigreed or non-pedigreed, there's no guarantee that she will or won't develop certain health conditions. If you're concerned about your Turkish Angora's health, talk to your veterinarian about steps you can take to ensure a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Turkish Angoras are delicately built cats that have been described as ballerina-like. Their silky coat is long but single-layered, making it low maintenance. The hair tends to be wispy and shimmers in the sunlight.</p><p>Angoras were originally considered strictlywhite cats with blue or green eyes. Today, the breed standard includes a variety of colors and variations, including Himalayan, calico, tortoiseshell, and tabby with virtually any eye color.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your Angora's diet depends largely on its age, sex, and activity levels. If you're not sure how much to feed your cat, check the feeding guide from your favorite cat food, or talk to your veterinarian. Overfeeding can lead to obesity, which can lead to a host of other health problems, so it's important to maintain a healthy, balanced diet for your Turkish Angora.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Turkish Angora</h2><p>If you choose to work with a breeder, it's important to do your research and ensure they have an ethical, reputable program. Be alert to signs of an unethical program, like extremely frequent litters of kittens or the ability to pay for your kitten online. If you're able to visit the breeding site, large volumes of cats and unhealthy or sick-looking cats are indicators of poor breeding practices.</p><h2>Turkish Angora Overview</h2><p>Cat fanciers who enjoy the occasionally mischievous antics of a highly intelligent (and easily bored) cat will adore the Turkish Angora. This silky, affectionate feline loves attention, from humans and other pets, and it's not afraid to demand it. The Angora's luxurious coat requires very little brushing and sheds minimally, so it is easy to care for. Plus, this breed is naturally quite healthy compared to many of its pedigreed cousins.</p><p>Beautiful and low-maintenance</p><p>Sociable and animated</p><p>Enjoys the company of people and other pets</p><p>Gets bored easily and doesn't like being alone</p><p>Can make mischief if ignored</p><p>Difficult to find</p>",1110

They're hard-working, healthy, and loyal herding dogs that will thrive best in an active home where they are given a lot of exercise and stimulation.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 16 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 29 to 44 pounds</p><p>Coat: Double-coated, with a soft, thick, and curly (or wavy) topcoat</p><p>Coat Color: Always black, but can have white markings on the chest</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, alert, energetic, companionable, attentive, active</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Croatia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Croatian Sheepdog</h2><p>Croatian sheepdogs share many of their personality characteristics with others breeds in the herding group, including their voracious appetite for exercise, quick intelligence, and desire for a ""job."" The breed thrives on strong leadership from their humans and will be a loyal and gentle companion given the right training and care.</p><h2>History of the Croatian Sheepdog</h2><p>There is evidence of dogs matching the description of the Croatian sheepdog dating all the way back to the late 14th century. It's believed these dogs may have traveled with their owners to Croatia during the Great Migration of the native Croat people in the 7th century.</p><p>Croatian sheepdogs were prized for being hard-working, enthusiastic, courageous, and versatile herders, and were known to drive sheep, cattle, pigs, and even horses. In 1935, Dr. Stjepan Romic, a Croatian vet, started a selective breeding program for the Croatian sheepdog. Most of the dogs came from the region of Đakovo, the area where much of their history was recorded. In 1969, the breed was officially recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI). They were registered under the Foundation Stock Service for the American Kennel Club in 2017, and are working towards full breed recognition.</p><h2>Croatian Sheepdog Care</h2><p>The Croatian sheepdog is best suited to an experienced home that can offer them an appropriate amount of exercise and enrichment on a daily basis. These are not dogs that will do well being cooped up in an apartment for much of the day on their own. This could lead to a stressed-out, bored dog that will exhibit destructive and problem behaviors.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Croatian sheepdogs have lots of energy and thrive on company. If you lead an active, outdoor lifestyle, then they will likely slot in well. As long as they get enough exercise at least an hour or more daily they are usually relatively calm and quiet around the house. Known for their excellent jumping ability, they will also excel in many dog sports and will need a high fence if you choose to keep them off-leash outdoors in your yard.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Croatian sheepdogs do not have a high maintenance grooming regime while they do shed, it's not excessive and their coat is designed to repel dirt naturally. To maintain their coat, brush them once a week to remove any debris, dead hair, and knots. You'll want to clean their ears periodically with a gentle cloth, keeping an eye out for any unusual redness or secretions, as these may be signs of a serious infection. Additionally, be sure to brush your dog's teeth every other day, or at least once a week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Croatian sheepdogs are highly intelligent, gentle, and respond well to force-free training. They are eager to please and love to have a job to do, so if you're looking for a breed that will enjoy competitive obedience, you will have a good partner in a Croatian sheepdog.</p><p>Providing they have appropriate training and socialization, they can get on well with other dogs and people too, and tend to have a playful personality. Croatian Sheepdogs can develop a particularly strong bond with one individual in the household, and they will be fiercely devoted to them. However, they can be wary of strangers and may act cold or uninterested. Their wariness means that they can be excellent non-aggressive watchdogs. You should be prepared to put in some training to make sure that this wariness does not lead to fearful behavior, over-enthusiastic guarding, or overly frequent alert barking.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Croatian sheepdog is a robust and healthy breed and does not have any known major inheritable health conditions. However, it's still important to do your research and find a reputable breeder to ensure that they are selecting healthy parents, which can minimize any genetic problems being passed on to their puppies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Croatian sheepdogs, like all dogs, do well on high-quality and appropriately portion-controlled dog food. If your pup regularly partakes in high-energy dog sports or long daily hikes, then you may want to consider a diet suited to active dogs, as they'll be burning off fat more quickly. If you have any questions about the proper diet or food portions for your dog, you can always inquire with your vet.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Croatian Sheepdog</h2><p>The Croatian sheepdog is a rare breed even in their native Croatia, they are still not found in large numbers. Because of this, you may need to go on a waiting list or travel further to secure a puppy from a reputable breeder. Don't let your enthusiasm and impatience tempt you to cut corners, though. If you support a backyard breeder or puppy farm, you could end up with an unhealthy and under-socialized puppy, and you could be inadvertently supporting an industry rife with cruelty and bad practices.</p><p>There are lots of herding breeds in rescues across the country. You could certainly find a collie or sheepdog-type rescue with similar characteristics to the Croatian sheepdog looking for a loving forever home in your local shelter.</p><h2>Croatian Sheepdog Overview</h2><p>Devoted to their owners</p><p>Intelligent, eager to please and easy to train</p><p>Excels in dog sports</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise and enrichment</p><p>Can be wary of strangers</p><p>They can be intense</p>",955

Standing at just 10 inches tall, the small-but-mighty Norwich Terrier is a cute and cuddly breed that also happens to be courageous and seemingly fearless when hunting vermin, like rats.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 pounds</p><p>HEIGHT: 10 inches</p><p>COAT: Hard, wiry, and straight</p><p>COAT COLOR: Red, wheaten, black and tan, or grizzle</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, bright, playful, lively, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Norwich Terrier</h2><p>If there's one thing the Norwich Terrier loves, it's human companionship. This petite pup thrives on love and attention from its owner or family and will pay you back with affection and loyalty for years to come. With a fearless attitude and a bit of sass, this fun-loving breed is a great option for all types of homes.</p><h2>History of the Norwich Terrier</h2><p>The Norwich Terrier was originally bred as one of many varieties of terriers that were designed to help control Britain's rodent population only, in addition to their skills as being ""ratter"" dogs, the Norwich Terriers were also called upon to serve on foxhunts. They were also bred to be more sociable and affable than the typical terrier, which tends to be more independent. The Norwich's pricked-ear shape is also a distinguishing physical characteristic.</p><p>The Norwich Terrier is believed to be a cross between small Irish Terriers and other short-legged terrier breeds. Once known as Cantab Terriers, these hardy little dogs proved themselves useful on the hunt, in the stable yard, and at home where they made playful and fun-loving family pets. One of the smallest of the working terriers, the Norwich is both sturdy and stocky, which proved to be an asset when chasing game down tight passageways.</p><p>The Norwich Terrier has been famously associated with Cambridge University. In the 1870s and 1880s, ownership of these particular dogs became something of a fad among undergraduates. The students acquired the dogs from a livery stable on nearby Trumpington Street to serve as both cuddly pets as well as dorm-room ratters, and thus the breed also became known as ""Trumpington Terriers."" It's believed that one of these dogs, whose name was Rags, came into the possession of a stableyard owner in the town of Norwich. Rags was bred and is today considered the grandfather of what ultimately became the Norwich Terrier. A more recent ""famous"" Norwich Terrier was Winky, who appeared in the movie and was played by a real-life show champion.</p><p>The breed's American history didn't begin until in 1914, when a British man named Frank ""Roughrider"" Jones bred a dog named Willum from descendants of Rags. Willum was exported to Philadelphia and became the breed's cornerstone in the United States. In the United States, the dogs actually came to be known as the Jones Terrier by breed devotees, even after the breed was formally recognized by the English and American kennel clubs as the Norwich Terrier in the 1920s.</p><p>There wasn't a lot of uniformity in the breed until 1923, when a breed standard was accepted by the English Kennel Club. In fact, Norwich and Norfolk terriers remained so closely related that the AKC didn't even recognize them as separate breeds until 1979. The name included both the drop-eared and prick-eared varieties until that time.</p><h2>Norwich Terrier Care</h2><p>Overall, the Norwich Terrier is a happy-go-lucky dog that's both loyal and affectionate. They're adaptable, inquisitive, and make ideal family companions. They are moderately friendly with other pets and should thus be trained and socialized properly in order to properly develop their friendly and outgoing personalities</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Norwich Terriers require a fair amount of exercise for the sake of both their mental and physical well-being. It's important that they are provided with plenty of playtime in a fenced-in yard, and walks should always be done on a leash because it will be hard for them to deny their innate desire to chase small animals.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Norwich Terriers have a double coat made up of a harsh (yet practically weatherproof) outer coat, while their soft undercoat insulates their tiny bodies from the heat and cold. Needless to say, this breed will require regular grooming. Wire coats that are cared for properly by hand-stripping will retain a beautiful shine and rich colors; the process requires removing older outer hairs and the excess undercoat so that new hair can come in. Because clipping or scissoring cuts the colored tips off, their coat's natural color will fade and the texture will also soften. Learning to hand-strip (or finding a groomer who is willing to do so) is an important consideration for potential Norwich Terrier owners.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Because they're so spirited, Norwich Terriers are usually eager to please and respond well to training. These dogs are also successful in performance and companion events, including barn hunt, agility, earth dog, and obedience.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Norwich Terrier is an overall healthy breed, but they have been associated with health conditions such as hip dysplasia, degenerative myelopathy, epilepsy, and upper airway syndrome, a respiratory condition that unfortunately remains poorly understood. This breed is also especially prone to developing plaque and tartar, so diligent dental care will be necessary.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Norwich Terrier does well with high-quality commercially or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times. As with all breeds, treats should be given in moderation and their diet should be controlled in order to avoid weight gain or obesity-related issues.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Norwich Terrier</h2><p>Check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for Norwich Terriers that are in need of a forever home. National rescue organizations such as the Norwich Terrier Club of America can be a helpful source of information to help you find your new best friend. You can also scour the AKC Marketplace for reputable breeders in your area with Norwich Terrier puppies available.</p><h2>Norwich Terrier Overview</h2><p>Great family dogs</p><p>Useful rodent hunters</p><p>High trainability</p><p>Tend to shed</p><p>Require regular grooming</p>",989

Its silky hair is parted down the back and hangs straight. Some owners clip it short for easier maintenance while others let it grow long and luxurious. These dogs have a wedge-shaped head and upright, V-shaped ears that help to give them an alert expression. And they are truly bright and watchful dogs. They are quick to bark at strangers or other perceived threats, yet they tend to be quite loving with their family. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long, silky</p><p>Coat Color: Black and tan; blue and tan; blue, silver, and tan; gray and tan; silver and tan; or silver, black, and tan</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, alert, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Australia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Silky Terrier</h2><p>Silky terriers generally have a spunky and playful personality. They are alert to their surroundings and like to be busy. High intelligence also helps to shape their temperament, though they sometimes can be stubborn when it comes to training.</p><h2>History of the Silky Terrier</h2><p>The silky terrier got its start in the early 20th century. Breeders in Australia crossed Yorkshire terriers with Australian terriers to get the earliest versions of the breed. Other breeds that might have played a role in its makeup include the cairn terrier, Dandie Dinmont, and Skye terrier. </p><p>At first, there were conflicting breed standards throughout Australia. But those were merged by 1926. The breed also was initially known as the Sydney silky terrier before it became the Australian silky terrier in 1955.</p><p>The Australian National Kennel Council first recognized the breed in 1958, the year the council itself was formed. And one of its first orders of business was to recommend a breed standard to the American Kennel Club. The AKC then recognized the breed in 1959, calling it the silky terrier.</p><h2>Silky Terrier Care</h2><p>Silky terriers need daily exercise and consistent training and socialization. Their grooming also can be a substantial time investment, depending on how long you keep their coat.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The silky terrier is an active but typically not hyper dog that requires daily exercise. Plan to spend at least an hour per day exercising your dog via walks, hikes, vigorous games of fetch, and more. In addition, silky terriers can enjoy and excel at a variety of dog sports, which will challenge them both mentally and physically.</p><p>Make sure always to keep your dog on a leash or in a securely fenced area for outdoor exercise. These little dogs don't tend to back down when confronted by larger dogs. And their prey drive can cause them to run off chasing squirrels and other small animals. They also are prone to digging and might escape under fences, so they always should be monitored in a yard.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The silky terrier's coat is straight, shiny, and fine in texture. It grows continuously and is quite similar to human hair. A commitment to routine grooming is absolutely essential if you have this breed. Brush at least twice a week and up to daily, depending on how long the coat is. Use a pin brush, soft-bristle brush, or comb to work out tangles and prevent mats. </p><p>Plan on a bath, along with a coat trim, roughly every four to six weeks. You might want to use a canine conditioner or grooming spray to help keep the coat tangle-free. Also, check your dog's nails at that time to see whether they need a trim. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and irritation. And aim to brush its teeth every day. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Silky terriers are quite smart and can learn training commands quickly. However, they also can be stubborn about when they want to obey. Aim to start training at a young age to prevent bad habits from forming. Always use positive-reinforcement methods. And be consistent in your commands; don't let bad behavior slide.</p><p>Likewise, start socialization from a young age. Introduce your dog to different people and other dogs to boost its comfort in new situations and ward off potential problems of being territorial. Silky terriers are typically adaptive to different living situations, but they sometimes can be reserved around new people. </p><p>Furthermore, many silky terriers don't like being left alone for long periods. They might act out due to boredom or loneliness via problem behaviors, such as excessive chewing or barking. A professional dog trainer or behaviorist can give you tips on leaving your dog alone. But it's still best that a silky terrier lives in a household with someone home for most of the day. </p><p>Similarly, excessive alert barking also can become problematic. So you'll likely have to work on training your dog on when it's appropriate to bark and how to be quiet on command.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Make sure your dog always has access to fresh water. And feed a high-quality canine diet with balanced nutrition. A diet especially made for small dog breeds, offered twice a day in measured meals, can be ideal. But you should always run both the type of food and the amount by your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Also, be mindful of treats and other extra food to ensure that your dog isn't overeating, as even a little extra weight can be a lot on a small frame.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Silky Terrier</h2><p>The silky terrier isn't a very popular dog breed. However, it's still possible to find one for adoption. So be sure to check local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $800 to $3,500 on average.</p><h2>Silky Terrier Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and playful</p><p>Generally adaptable to different living situations</p><p>Can excel at dog sports</p><p>High grooming needs</p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p><p>Prone to digging</p>",979

The distinctive appearance and calm, collected demeanor of these dogs make them stand out among similar breeds. Dandie Dinmont Terriers are often referred to as the ""gentlemen"" of the terrier group thanks to their calm personalities.</p><p>Due to their compact size, desirable temperament, and low-to-moderate exercise needs, Dandie Dinmont Terriers can thrive in both apartments and larger homes.

These dogs make great family pets or travel companions, and they enjoy spending time with their human family (though they sometimes have a reserved temperament with strangers). Thanks to their compact size, Dandie Dinmont Terriers are typically a good choice for households with cats despite their origins in hunting. They may not be suitable to live alongside smaller pets like hamsters or mice, but they can do well with other dogs when raised together. Their low exercise needs and independent personalities also make them ideal for urban life or owners without lots of time to spend with their dogs.</p><h2>History of the Dandie Dinmont Terrier</h2><p>Originating in the Cheviot Hills on the border of England and Scotland, the Dandie Dinmont Terrier was originally bred to hunt otters, badgers, and pests like rats and mice during the 1600s. Although there are conflicting origin stories and theories, it's commonly believed that Dandie Dinmonts were the result of breeding Scottish Terriers with Skye Terriers, or Otterhounds and rough-haired terriers.</p><p>Despite their hundreds of years of history, Dandie Dinmont Terriers weren't given their unique name until 1814 when Sir Walter Scott published his book, The book featured a character named Dandie Dinmont, who owned terriers named Pepper and Mustard (after their coat colors).</p><p>After was published, Dandie Dinmonts gained popularity among European royalty, including King Louis Philippe and Queen Victoria. It's commonly believed that during these years of growth, Dandie Dinmonts were bred with Dachshunds, resulting in their unique, elongated physiques.</p><p>The Dandie Dinmont Terrier was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1886, and it remains the only recognized breed named after a fictional character.</p><h2>Dandie Dinmont Terrier Care</h2><p>Because of the Dandie Dinmont's small size and calm temperament, this breed is relatively easy to care for when it comes to exercise. However, they can require specific grooming to maintain their coats along with persistent training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Dandie Dinmonts have low-to-moderate exercise requirements. They can thrive in smaller spaces, like apartments, as well as larger houses with yards. Aim for a few walks or two 20- to 30-minute blocks of playtime each day to keep your Dandie Dinmont properly exercised. It's also important to note that these dogs should never be allowed off-leash in an unfenced area. They have a strong prey drive, meaning they're likely to chase after birds, squirrels, and other animals if given the opportunity.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Although Dandie Dinmonts are working dogs, their coats require regular maintenance. You can expect to clip their coats with scissors every four to six weeks to maintain their unique shape and appearance. Dandie Dinmonts should also be brushed several times per week with a soft brush to remove any mats or tangles. Even though this breed's coat is higher maintenance than other terriers, their low-shedding nature is ideal for owners with allergies and cuts down on the need to vacuum pet hair.</p><p>In order to prevent plaque build-up that can lead to gum disease and bad breath, it's important to brush your dog's teeth at least two to three times per week (but every day is preferred).</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like other terriers, training a Dandie Dinmont requires persistence and patience. These dogs are highly intelligent, so they can become bored easily. Keep training engaging and interesting by incorporating playtime and challenges for your dog. In true terrier form, Dandie Dinmonts are also prone to digging, so it's helpful to train against this habit or create a designated digging area in your yard.</p><p>Overall, Dandie Dinmont Terriers are highly intelligent but lower-energy terriers that are adaptable to their surroundings. Expect to be hands-on during obedience training and prepare for holes in your backyard. Dandie Dinmont Terriers may be the ""gentlemen"" of the group, but their terrier instincts can sometimes take over.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>As with other purebreds, Dandie Dinmonts are susceptible to certain health concerns.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your dog's nutritional needs depend on its age, activity level, size, and metabolism. Generally, most Dandie Dinmonts should eat between 1 and 1 1/2 cups of high-quality, high-protein food twice per day.</p><p>Overfeeding your dog can lead to a host of health problems, including heart disease and diabetes. Talk to your vet to determine a healthy meal plan for your specific dog to prevent canine obesity and ensure it receives the proper nutrients.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Dandie Dinmont Terrier</h2><p>The Dandie Dinmont Terrier is an especially rare dog breed. Adopting this type of dog may prove difficult, but there are plenty of other similar terrier breeds ready for adoption. If you're interested in a Dandie Dinmont, consider rescuing a terrier from your local shelter or searching for breed-specific rescues.</p><p>If you do find a litter of Dandie Dinmont Terrier puppies, traveling or joining a waiting list may be required. Ensure the breeder provides the medical history of the litter's parents to increase your dog's chances of living a long, healthy life. These puppies typically cost between $1,500 and $3,000 depending on pedigree and availability.</p><h3>Dandie Dinmont Terrier Overview</h3><p>Calm personality</p><p>Low-shedding</p><p>Great apartment and travel companions</p><p>Needs considerable grooming</p><p>Can be stubborn during training</p><p>Prone to digging</p>",1015

This well-loved and highly regarded animal, sometimes referred to as a ""tiger dog"" for its subtly striped coat, is an extremely intelligent breed that forms strong, close bonds with its owner and is said to go to great lengths to protect its special person. The Kai Ken originates from Japan and was widely used as a versatile hunting dog. Its famous brindle coat acts as a natural camouflage, perfectly equipping this breed for the mountainous terrain in which it's bred to work.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 15.5 to 19.5 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 20 to 40 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Brindle, black brindle, or red brindle (the rarest color)</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, protective, loyal, agile, alert, reserved, brave</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Japan</p><h2>Characteristics of the Kai Ken</h2><p>Being a loyal, amiable, and affectionate dog, the Kai Ken usually does well with respectful children and other dogs, especially if properly socialized at an early age. The breed's strong prey drive may take over around smaller pets, but each individual Kai Ken will differ.  </p><h2>History of the Kai Ken </h2><p>Originally found in the mountainous region of Japan near Mount Fuji, the Kai Ken got its name from the Kai province where it was found in 1929. This agile, intelligent breed quickly became a well-known hunter and was used to pursue a wide variety of prey. In 1933, Japan's government declared the Kai Ken a natural monument. In 1934, the breed was recognized by the Japanese Kennel Club. </p><p>Though the exact history of the Kai Ken dogs found in the United States is a bit murky, it is believed that they were first brought in the 1950s. However, it was not until much more recently, in the 1990s, that more Kai Kens were imported and the foundation for this still very rare breed was established. The breed had a moment of fame when in 2003, former First Lady Nancy Reagan found a sick and starving Kai Ken puppy in the streets of Los Angeles and saved its life, naming it Little Bear.</p><p>The Kai Ken is still not a fully recognized breed of the American Kennel Club (AKC). It is part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service (FSS) while it awaits full recognition.</p><h2>Kai Ken Care</h2><p>The Kai Ken is well-suited to taking part in dog sports, agility, and any other activity that involves working alongside its owner. With the proper exercise and care, the Kai Ken can be a very loyal, special dog to own. Because of their active nature, these dogs need daily attention and exercise. If their needs are not met they will find something to busy themselves and they could become destructive around the home.   </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Kai Ken is a strong, alert, and agile breed, making both mental and physical exercise important every day. Try activities where your Kai Ken has the chance to work with you instead of for you, such as agility and other team-based sports. This breed will also be a great hiking partner and enjoys swimming. A Kai Ken needs at least one hour's worth of vigorous walking a day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Its famous brindle coat is of medium length and consists of two layers. This makes occasional brushing important to keep it in a healthy and shiny condition and to minimize shedding. The Kai Ken is a relatively clean dog, however, so baths shouldn't be needed very often. Twice a year, the Kai Ken will lose its undercoat, resulting in much more shedding. More frequent brushing and baths may be needed during this time. Always be sure to keep the dog's nails trimmed, check for dirt in the ears, and brush its teeth regularly to maintain overall health. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>With its firm loyalty and sharp intelligence, the Kai Ken is a joy to train. These dogs learn new things very quickly, enjoy working with their owners, and respond well to positive reinforcement. Though some Kai Kens are trained to walk off-leash, be extremely cautious. Hunting is in the breed's blood, and the Kai Ken has both a strong prey drive and a tendency to fulfill its need of adventure without you if you are not paying attention.  </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Kai Ken is generally considered healthy, but there are a few breed-specific diseases to be on the lookout for. Of course, always be on the watch for common health problems that can affect any dog too, such as obesity and ear infections.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>To help your Kai Ken live a long, healthy life, always feed it high-quality dog food. Like any dog, it is important not to overfeed your Kai Ken. However, this breed is known for self-regulating how much it eats, so overeating is not usually a problem. Every dog's dietary needs are unique, so consult your veterinarian for more information about your Kai Ken's needs.  </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Kai Ken</h2><p>The Kai Ken is an extremely loyal, intelligent dog sure to win over the heart of any dog lover. However, these canines require a high amount of mental and physical activity.</p><p>Because the Kai Ken is such a unique and prized dog, they may be difficult to find in shelters. However, it's always a good idea to make inquiries.</p><p>When looking for a Kai Ken puppy, always choose a reputable breeder to purchase from. Expect to pay a breeder between $1,500 to $2,500 for a puppy of this breed.

148,https://www.thesprucepets.com/whippet-dog-breed-profile-1118008,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Hound Dog Breeds,<h1>Whippet: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care </h1>,"<h1>Whippet: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care </h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p> </p><p>The whippet is a dog breed quite similar to the greyhound, though smaller in size. They can run as fast as 35 miles per hour, making the whippet the fastest dog breed of its size. This sighthound is also known for its alert, friendly, and playful demeanor. The joyful whippet is a lovely and loyal companion that makes a delightful addition to almost any household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 18 to 22 inches</p><p>Weight: 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short and smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Black, blue, fawn, red, white, and various shades of brindle, or a combination of any of these colors</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Quiet, friendly, gentle, calm, affectionate, Peaceful, Sweet-Tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Joyful Whippet</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Whippet</h2><p>Sleek and skinny, whippets are an underrated and easy dog breed perfect for families of all types. Their approachable size and medium exercise needs mean they require a below-average amount of care, while their sweet and easy-going temperament makes them just as likely to enjoy an evening on the couch or a walk in the park.</p><h2>History of the Whippet</h2><p>The whippet was the result of selective crossbreeding between greyhounds and terriers in England, explaining its appearance as a ""miniature greyhound."" Once used by the English working class to hunt small game (particularly rabbits), the breed eventually became quite valued in the sport of coursing. Much like the greyhound, the whippet is an extremely swift runner and is considered the fastest dog of its size.</p><p>The whippet was first brought to the United States in the late 1800s and registered with the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1888. Surprisingly, the breed was not officially recognized by the English Kennel Club until 1891.</p><h2>Whippet Care</h2><p>Whippets are very affectionate with their families and prefer not to be left alone, lest they experience separation anxiety. If your dog must be alone most of the day, a whippet may not be the best choice. They are rarely aggressive and act quite welcoming to strangers. For this reason, they do not make ideal guard dogs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>When it comes to whippets, it's important to ensure they get a moderate amount of exercise to circumvent any behavioral issues. Without exercise, you may see some destructive indoor habits, but they will wear off steam quickly when exercised. They tend to get along well with other dogs without being prone to aggression or dominance.</p><p>Whippets do love to run, so be sure to provide them with plenty of space and daily exercise. As a sighthound, the whippet is likely to run after anything in motion, and will not easily find its way back. The breed should never be permitted to run off-leash, and the ""invisible fence"" is not an option, as they will not stop once they spot something to chase. A fence that is 5 to 6 feet tall should keep them safely in the yard.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The whippet has a very short, smooth coat that needs very little grooming. The breed sheds at a low to moderate rate, but shedding tends to increase seasonally. Most whippets will only need periodic brushing with a grooming mitt and occasional bathing. Their nails should be kept short to prevent slipping on slick floors.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Proper training and socialization are both important for the whippet, as with all dogs. The breed is able to learn well with persistence and encouragement, though they do not seem to do well with crate training and often exhibit claustrophobia.</p><p>The American Whippet Club notes that whippets often show ""Excessive Greeting Disorder"" for both their family and anybody visiting. You will need to train your whippet not to be over-exuberant when you come home or somebody rings the doorbell.</p><p>It is important to know that cats and other small animals (such as squirrels) may provoke the whippet's predatory instinct. Proper socialization is essential, but the breed might never truly be trusted around small creatures. They are suitable for multi-dog households as long as any other breeds are similarly well-behaved with other dogs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in whippets.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A whippet will need two meals a day of up to 3/4 cup of dry dog food. Individual needs depend on the dog's size, activity level, age, and other factors. Your dog's nutritional needs will change throughout its life, so discuss what is appropriate with your veterinarian to get recommendations. Be sure to monitor your pet's weight to ensure the dog does not pack on any extra pounds.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Whippet</h2><p>If you think you are ready to get a whippet and believe it may be the right companion for you, then your best option may be to start with the American Whippet Club. A responsible breeder should register the litter with the AKC and provide registration applications upon request. The American Whippet Club encourages the registration of all whippets, even those bought solely for companions, and you may find that if you develop an interest later in coursing or obedience, you will be glad that you have a registration number for your dog.</p><p>You can also use local online pet adoption services like Petfinder or Adopt a Pet and search by breed, but in those cases, you may not have pedigree papers or get information about the dog's upbringing. Much like a rescue or dog shelter, you rarely get a full accounting of the dog's lineage or family history.</p><h2>Whippet Overview</h2><p>Friendly with visitors, children, and other animals</p><p>Does not shed much</p><p>Good apartment companion</p><p>Can get destructive if left alone or with no outlet for exercise</p><p>Quick to chase other animals; do not let off leash</p><p>Prone to separation anxiety</p>",956

Its origins as a cross between the Mastiff and the bulldog are apparent in its appearance. In personality, this breed is smart, alert, and loyal. Though the Bullmastiff has a natural protective instinct, the breed is typically quite gentle around children and others who pose no threat.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 24 to 27 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 100 to 130 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, dense coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Fawn, red, or brindle with accents of black</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 10 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, protective, alert, loving, companionable, calm</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bullmastiff</h2><p>Despite their seemingly imposing appearance, Bullmastiffs are a calm, cool, and collected breed. They crave human companionship and will be fiercely loyal to their owners and family, preferring to be by their side at all times. They thrive with formal training and are often regarded as docile and sweet.</p><h2>History of the Bullmastiff</h2><p>The Bullmastiff breed was developed in England during the mid-1800s. Gamekeepers needed a dog to protect their game from poachers, so they experimented with cross-breeding. At the time, bulldogs were fierce and intrepid much more so than today's bulldog yet the breed was too small to take down a human. The mastiff was too large and slow to do the job, but crossing the two breeds resulted in the ideal guard dog. The brindle color was preferred as it provided natural camouflage. This breed was imported to guard the De Beers diamond mines in South Africa.</p><p>Though the Bullmastiff still makes an excellent guard dog, it is better known today as a friendly companion and wonderful family dog. This breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1933.</p><h2>Bullmastiff Care</h2><p>Bullmastiffs are very gentle companions and protectors that make lovely family pets. They will get along wonderfully with children when properly trained and socialized. As large dogs, they have the potential of knocking down small children or reacting poorly to any mistreatment by a small child. Supervise the dog whenever it is with small children and consider waiting until your children are older before adding a Bullmastiff to your household.<br/></p><p>They like to live indoors with others, but they do tolerate a household where their people are gone during the workday, as long as they are given attention before and after the absence. However, if left alone in a yard without access to family life, a bullmastiff can develop some destructive behaviors. Above all, the Bullmastiff is a loyal and affectionate house pet that forms a close bond with its humans.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p><br/>The Bullmastiff is not overly active, but the breed needs routine exercise to remain fit and motivated. Take your dog for a couple of walks each day and start good leash training from puppyhood. The Bullmastiff will be so large and powerful in adulthood that if it pulls on the leash, you will have a difficult time controlling it. Additionally, these dogs probably shouldn't be allowed to run free in a dog park, as they're unlikely to do well with other canines. The Bullmastiff is vulnerable to overheating, due to its short snout. Don't overdo exercise, and be sure to keep your dog cool in hot weather.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Bullmastiff has a short coat that typically needs little more than routine grooming. This breed is a moderately low shedder. Additionally, the Bullmastiff's ears and facial skin folds (if present) should be kept clean and dry. This breed is a drooler, so be prepared when it shakes its head carrying a slobber rag is often in order for this one.</p><p>Your dog should be able to naturally wear down its nails through activity, but check them and give them a trim if you hear clicking on the floor. It's also good to pay attention to your dog's dental hygiene and brush its teeth a couple of times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like all dogs, proper training and socialization are important for the Bullmastiff. Overall, the breed is smart but also has an independent streak, thus training will require firm consistency. Curb any habit of jumping on people early on, as this can lead to a hazardous situation once the dog is fully grown.</p><p>Bullmastiffs are not a good match for multi-pet households. They have a high prey drive and may harass cats and other small pets, even if they are raised together. Similarly, they don't do well with other dogs. In particular, male Bullmastiffs do not live peaceably with other male dogs of any breed. They will confront any animal entering its territory.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in Bullmastiffs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A Bullmastiff should be fed twice a day, with each meal consisting of 1 1/2 cups to 2 cups of dry dog food, depending on your pet's size and activity level. Always ensure your dog has access to fresh, clean water. Your dog's needs will change throughout its lifespan, so it's a good idea to discuss their health with your veterinarian to develop the right feeding schedule, amount, type of food, and exercise routine.</p><p>Feeding your dog two meals can help prevent the problem of bloating and stomach torsion (gastric dilatation-volvulus). When a dog gulps down food or eats a large meal, it can lead to excessive gas production. In this breed, the stomach may then twist and cut off the blood supply, which becomes a medical emergency.</p><p>Additionally, make sure to monitor your dog's weight and take action if you notice any additional pounds creeping on. Obesity can shorten your dog's lifespan and predispose it to additional health conditions.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bullmastiff</h2><p>Check with your local area shelter or rescue groups to find Bullmastiffs available for adoption in your area. The American Bullmastiff Association's mission is to find homes for unwanted Bullmastiffs, while Mastiffs to Mutts Rescue Inc. provides rescue efforts in the mid-Atlantic states. The ABA also provides a list of breeders but does not guarantee or endorse any particular person or group. Generally, you can expect to spend around $1,000 to $1,500 for a Bullmastiff puppy from a breeder.</p><h2>Dog Breed Overview</h2><p>Make excellent watchdogs</p><p>Don't need a significant amount of exercise</p><p>Has short hair that's easy to care for and doesn't shed significantly</p><p>Large and powerful, which can be difficult for small people or children to handle</p><p>Potentially aggressive toward other animals and people</p><p>Have a short lifespan of just eight to 10 years</p>",1083

It can get along quite well with kids, but make sure to be careful when the dog is around small children. A giant dog is not always aware of its size. Overall, the dogue de Bordeaux is an excellent choice if you want a large canine that makes a wonderful protector and companion.</p><h2>History of the Dogue de Bordeaux</h2><p>Though the dogue de Bordeaux did not become eligible for AKC registration until 2007, it is considered one of the oldest breeds in France. While its true origins are not completely clear, the dogue is likely a relative of the bulldog and bullmastiff.</p><p>The dogue was classically used to protect, herd cattle, hunt, and bull bait. The breed was historically found in wealthy French homes, but it endured many hardships and attempts at extinction throughout time.</p><p>In the 1960s, enthusiasts further developed the breed, leading to its increased popularity. The dogue de Bordeaux is perhaps best known for its lovable role in the 1989 film ""Turner & Hooch.""</p><h2>Dogue de Bordeaux Care</h2><p>The dogue de Bordeaux can have a strong instinct to chase smaller animals such as cats. The breed also may not tolerate another dog in the household, especially of the same sex. While socialization and training can help prevent problems, it may not be able to eliminate the risk.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The dogue de Bordeaux is moderately energetic for its size and needs a proper outlet. Along with training, adequate exercise, such as one long walk or a few shorter walks each day totaling about 45 minutes is very important. However, remember not to overdo it because this large breed dog may be prone to orthopedic problems. Walk the dog at a comfortable, not vigorous pace.</p><p>Additionally, the dogue is a brachycephalic (short-nosed) breed that can possibly overheat or develop breathing issues. Make sure you have a firm understanding of your dog's endurance level. You won't be able to carry this mega-size dog home if it cannot make it through a walk on its own four paws.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The dogue de Bordeaux has a very short, soft-hair coat that requires little attention. Occasional use of a grooming mitt or glove should be sufficient for coat care.</p><p>However, the numerous skin folds on the dogue's face do require routine cleaning to avoid irritation and infection. Because of its giant size, a grooming routine should be established early on so your dog gets used to it. Brushing the dogue's teeth regularly (daily if possible) will help to prevent dental disease. Although the dogue's nails may wear down naturally, check them periodically and trim the nails as needed. Your dog should only need bathing a couple of times per year.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>An untrained dog of this size can become utterly uncontrollable. A rigorous training program should be established as soon as possible after getting a dogue. Socialization is equally important. This is, in part, due to the massive size of the breed.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The dogue de Bordeaux typically has a shorter life than smaller dog breeds. There are some hereditary health problems that can occur in this breed. Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. Owners can prevent some problems while puppies are growing by not be over-exercising or overfeeding them so that they put on excessive weight.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Adult dogs need four to seven cups of dry food each day, which should be split into two meals. You will need to take care that your dog does not gulp down a large amount of food at once as that increases the risk of bloat and stomach torsion. Feed the dog twice a day and don't allow free-feeding or exercise for one to two hours after a meal. Have clean, fresh water available.</p><p>This breed is prone to food allergies, especially wheat, and you may have to provide a special diet. Luckily, there are good-quality commercial large breed dog foods that are wheat-free.</p><p>These dogs can be expensive to feed as an adult male will eat a 50-pound bag of dry food per month.

Ragdolls are ideal lap cats because they simply go limp with pleasure when they are being petted, giving them their name. This cat breed is one of the largest, but don't let the size intimidate you. Their big blue eyes and loud, throaty purr let you know they're just big softies. Ragdolls are notoriously social, making them a good fit for bustling homes with plenty of people and friendly pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Friendly, easygoing, cuddly, social</p><p>Weight: Up to 20 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 40 inches nose to tail</p><p>Coat Length: Medium-length hair</p><p>Coat Color: Chocolate, red, seal, blue, lilac, and cream</p><p>Coat Patterns: Mitted, color point, bicolor, tortoiseshell, lynx</p><p>Eye Color: Blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 17 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: California, USA</p><h2>Ragdoll Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The big, beautiful ragdoll cat does not reach its full size, about 15 pounds on average, until about four years of age. With its easygoing personality and social temperament, the ragdoll is ready to be friends with just about anyone. Prepare your lap for extended cuddling sessions in which your ragdoll will flop like a mop across your legs and expect enthusiastic belly rubs. The ragdoll does not need a lot of exercise or rambunctious play time, but snuggle time is essential.</p><h2>History of the Ragdoll Cat</h2><p>The ragdoll cat breed is relatively new. It was developed in California in the 1960s. A cat breeder named Ann Baker wanted to create a beautiful cat with a loving personality. She started by breeding a domestic long-haired, white cat of unknown origin named Josephine with several Burmese-like cats.</p><p>Though it took a few generations, Baker eventually produced the first cats she called ragdolls. These cats were appreciated for their non-matting fur, large size, and outgoing personalities.</p><p>The Cat Fanciers Association (CFA) began registering ragdolls in 1993. Ragdolls are consistently one of the most popular cat breeds registered by the CFA.</p><h2>Ragdoll Cat Care</h2><p>The ragdoll has a silky single coat (meaning that it doesn't have an under-layer of fur). It's meant to be lower-matting than other medium-haired cat coats. This breed still benefits from brushing at least twice a week to help avoid tangles.</p><p>Since ragdolls don't have an undercoat, the amount of shedding and dander production is lower than that of heavier coated breeds. However, many people are still allergic to saliva and skin secretions from cats, and ragdolls produce these allergens, so they are not considered hypoallergenic.</p><p>Like all other cats, ragdolls also generally need nail trims. Keep in mind that your cat will probably want to sharpen its claws even more than normal after a pedicure, so be sure to provide good scratching posts.</p><p>Ragdolls are moderately energetic, social cats. They enjoy regular playtime using wands or other interactive cat toys. Most also benefit from being fed out of a feline puzzle feeder for mental stimulation. Don't just leave toys around for your kitty, though, as it's best to get up and play together. This will help keep your cat's weight down, avoid behavior concerns caused by boredom, and build bonds within the family.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like many large breed cats, ragdolls are prone to weight issues. Feeding your cat out of puzzle toys and portioning out its daily food can help keep your cat fit and trim. Giving your cat regular play is also important for weight management. While chubby cats might be cute, they're not healthy.</p><p>They're vulnerable to bladder stones, which are painful and cause blood in the urine. Signs include vocalizing (crying) in the litter box, straining to urinate, or urinating outside the litter box. You can help your kitty avoid bladder stones and other urinary infections by encouraging it to drink lots of fresh water and scheduling regular checkups with your veterinarian.</p><p>Ragdolls are also prone to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), a condition that is difficult to prevent. HCM is a heart disease that causes thickening of the heart muscle. An echocardiogram can help diagnose the problem, but only after the cat has developed HCM. Genetic testing can also help breeders avoid breeding cats with HCM, but it's always a risk, and there is no cure once a cat develops HCM.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Purebred ragdoll kittens are born solid white due to a genetic mutation. Their coats begin to develop colors and patterns around two months of age but don't fully develop their coloration for about two years. </p><p>A ragdoll's medium-length coat is silky-soft and often compared to rabbit fur. It is considered a ""pointed breed,"" meaning its body is lighter colored than its points (face, ears, legs, and tail). Its fur is somewhat longer and thicker around its neck, giving the appearance of a mane. Their ears are relatively small and slightly rounded.</p><p>These large cats are not overly muscled; they are rather soft and quite flexible.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Work with your vet to develop a diet appropriate for your ragdoll's age and activity level. Wet foods help provide moisture that can help prevent urinary issues. Be sure to ration the food, and don't leave it out in your cat's bowl all day. Leaving food out could lead to overeating and obesity, a risk factor for diabetes in cats.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Ragdoll Cat</h2><p>Take the time to get to know the breeder and the breed before making your purchase. The breeder can also help you get to know the breed and ensure that a ragdoll is right for you.

The coat typically comes in black but can be seen in wheaten and brindle patterns as well. Scotties have a sturdy build and short legs, which serve them well as vermin exterminators. They tend to be spunky, confident, and somewhat independent dogs, though they are quite loyal to their favorite humans.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 18 to 21 pounds (female), 19 to 22 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, wiry double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, brindle, red brindle, wheaten, black brindle, or silver brindle</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, affectionate, fearless</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Scotland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Scottish Terrier</h2><p>Scottish terriers tend to have an alert and spirited temperament. They are watchful with strangers and other perceived threats, but generally they are loving with their family. High intelligence also helps to shape this breed's personality, making it sometimes stubborn and strong-willed when it comes to training.</p><h2>History of the Scottish Terrier</h2><p>Terriers have been a part of the Scottish Highlands for centuries, working as hunters and farm dogs. These dogs ranged in appearance and were sometimes collectively referred to as Skye terriers after the Scottish Isle of Skye where many lived. The Scottish terrier's exact origin is unclear, but it's said to be the oldest of these Highland terriers. </p><p>Breeders worked to standardize the different types of terriers from Scotland during the late 1800s. From this we got not only the Scottie but also the Skye terrier, West Highland white terrier, and cairn terrier. </p><p>Scotties first arrived in the United States in 1883, and the American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1885. Its popularity peaked in the '30s and '40s. Several public figures, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Bette Davis, and Humphrey Bogart, have owned Scotties. And the breed has the honor of being turned into a playing piece.</p><h2>Scottish Terrier Care</h2><p>Scotties need a moderate amount of daily exercise, as well as sufficient mental stimulation. They also require more than just basic grooming and consistent training and socialization.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite the breed's small stature, Scotties should still get at least an hour of exercise per day. A morning and evening walk plus playtime in between can help to burn their energy. And puzzle toys, along with dog sports, can help to challenge them mentally as well.</p><p>These dogs also love to run and chase toys (though they don't always retrieve), so it's ideal to have a securely fenced yard where they can move freely. But avoid letting them off leash outside in unfenced areas. Their high prey drive can cause them to quickly take off after small animals and other perceived prey.</p><p>Furthermore, the Scottish terrier is not a capable swimmer and can easily drown. Its short legs and disproportionate size of its head make the dog unbalanced and ill-equipped for aquatic activities. So closely watch your Scottie around pools, ponds, lakes, or other bodies of water.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>A Scottie's coat doesn't shed much, but it does grow continuously and require specialized care. You'll need to invest in a professional groomer or learn the skills to care for your Scottie's coat at home. The ideal way to groom a Scottie is to have its coat hand-stripped at least once a month. The other option is to clip the coat roughly every six to eight weeks. The downside to this is clipping can change the coat's proper harsh texture as the softer undercoat takes over.</p><p>In between grooming sessions, brush the coat at least weekly to remove any tangles and dirt. Give your dog a bath every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. Check its nails every month as well to see whether they need a trim. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and irritation. Brush its teeth ideally every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Scotties are smart, but they're not always willing to learn. It's ideal to start training and socialization from a young age to prevent bad habits from forming. Keep training sessions short and switch up what you work on, so your dog doesn't get bored. </p><p>Always use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise. Scotties are known to understand the tone of a person's voice, recognizing the difference between a positive and negative reaction. Plus, it's very important to be consistent and firm in your commands. Scotties tend to push what they can get away with, so if you ask them to do something make sure they follow through. </p><p>Aim to expose your Scottie from a young age to different people and other dogs. This can help to reduce their territorial and vigilant nature around strangers. However, even a well-socialized Scottie might not get along with smaller household pets, including cats, due to the breed's high prey drive. And some remain standoffish with other dogs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide fresh water for your Scottish terrier. Feed a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure that your dog is getting the proper amount. Always discuss both the amount of food and type of diet with your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Moreover, be mindful of treats and other extra food to prevent overfeeding.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Scottish Terrier</h2><p>Scottish terriers are a moderately popular dog breed. So it's possible to find one at local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups, though it might require a waiting period. See whether you can get your name on a breed wait list at your local shelter. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay on average $800 to $2,000.</p><h2>Scottish Terrier Overview</h2><p>Loving with family</p><p>Only needs moderate exercise</p><p>Doesn't shed much</p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Needs more than basic grooming</p>",976

The savannah was named after the habitat of the serval, and its beauty echoes the lush splendor of those golden plains in Africa. Much like its wild cousin, the savannah cat is a tall, lean cat with long legs, big ears, and a long neck. Its coat bears a characteristic spotted pattern that gives it a wild appeal.</p><p>Unlike servals, savannah cats are affectionate and sociable with other pets and older children. Because of their hybrid ancestry, though, savannah cats cannot be legally owned without a permit in many locations and are illegal to own in some states.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate and social with owners, pets, and older children; intelligent and trainable</p><p>Weight: 12 to 25 pounds (depending on the generation)</p><p>Length: 20 to 22 inches (depending on the generation)</p><p>Coat Length: Short to medium hair</p><p>Coat Color: Tawny, Black/brown spotted tabby, black/silver spotted tabby, or black smoke with a solid or tabby pattern</p><p>Coat Patterns: Spotted, striped, or solid</p><p>Eye Color: Amber or green</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Africa (serval), Varied Locations (domestic cat)</p><h2>Savannah Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The savannah cat makes an excellent companion; it's sociable with people and pets, highly intelligent, and always willing to greet its owners with friendly head bumps. This cat may look wild, but it enjoys domestic life and interacting with its owners. A savannah cat may follow its owner around the house like a dog but also relishes its feline independence.</p><p>Savannahs generally get along well with other cats and dogs, and they're good with older children (toddlers may be easily overwhelmed by these large, playful cats). When buying a savannah cat, choose a breeder who has socialized the kittens in a home with pets and kids so that they are not shy or fearful of these interactions.</p><h2>History of the Savannah Cat</h2><p>Although the savannah cat is a relatively new breed, it is extremely popular. There are dozens of savannah breeders in North America and over 60 breeders worldwide.</p><p>Registries that accept the savannah cat include The International Cat Association and The International Progressive Cat Breeders' Alliance.<br/></p><h2>Savannah Cat Training and Care</h2><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Savannah cats' long legs and athletic grace lend themselves to leaping, and these cats love landing on high surfaces. Provide a tall cat tree or other safe climbing opportunities. Of course, you must also expect your savannah to spy high places cabinet tops, shelves, refrigerators and attempt to scale them as well. It's a quirk that many owners learn to love; just make sure there are no breakable items in your cat's way.</p><p>Like servals, many savannahs also love to play in water. Fill a kiddie pool and let your cat explore the water at its own pace (don't plunk the cat into the pool). An enclosure around the pool can allow outdoor fun without the risk of escape. Just make sure to provide shade on hot summer days.</p><p>In addition, savannah cats will often accept wearing a harness and accompanying their owners on outdoor walks.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The savannah cat has a short coat that is easy to care for. You can brush your cat weekly to help keep hairballs at bay, and trim your cat's nails as often as needed to dull their sharp tips for indoor living. Brush your cat's teeth frequently and get appropriate veterinary cleanings.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Savannah cats have been called dog-like in their love of playing fetch and their ability to be trained. You can clicker-train them as you would a dog to do tricks and obey commands.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Savannah cats are generally healthy and should be given the same veterinary preventative care visits and treatments as other domestic cats. However, they are more prone to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than fully domestic cats. This heart condition causes thickening of the heart's left ventricle, which can lead to heart failure.</p><p>Also, hybrid male sterility is to be expected until the F4 generation.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The savannah cat is tall and lean with long legs and a long neck (its cousin, the serval, is sometimes called the ""giraffe cat"" because of these characteristics). Its large ears sit high atop its head and are more rounded than most domestic cats' ears.</p><p>The savannah's coat ranges in color from light tawny to smoky black and bears a characteristic black spotted pattern with occasional bars. Occasionally, a savannah cat may be solid black, lacking spots.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Savannah cats have the same nutritional requirements as domestic cats. Some experts recommend a combination of commercial dry food or wet food and raw or cooked meat. Some experts feel the breed needs more taurine and may recommend a taurine supplement. Others suggest that if you give dry food, then it should be free of grain or corn since its wild ancestors eat a whole protein diet.</p><p>Be sure to provide fresh, clean water for your cat (although a savannah cat is likely to play in the water dish).</p><p>If adopting a kitten, discuss the cat's diet with your breeder and your veterinarian. A cat's needs will change throughout its lifespan, and you need to ensure your cat does not become overweight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Savannah Cat</h2><p>You may be able to find a purebred savannah cat through a breeder, but these cats are a rare find. If you would rather adopt from a rescue organization, check out the Savannah Cat Rescue.</p><h2>Types of Savannah Cat</h2><p>The types of savannah cat are expressed in terms of filial generation (i.e. the number of generations a cat is from the serval in its lineage), and the nomenclature includes designations from F1 through F8.</p><p>By F4 the cat's size and temperament are said to be more predictable. At that level, at least one great-great-grandparent was a serval.</p><p>A Stud Book Traditional Savannah cat is at least four generations removed from the serval but has only savannah cat parents for at least three generations, without further outbreeding with domestic cats.</p><p>A male is not fertile usually until the sixth generation from the serval parent. The females are usually fertile from the first generation.</p><h2>Savannah Cat Overview</h2><p>The savannah cat is a fantastic family pet with wild appeal. Not only is it beautiful and exotic-looking, but it is also large and playful, and it enjoys interacting with kids and other pets. Unfortunately, savannah cats are not easily acquired; their breeders are few and far between, and the cats are very expensive.

The British shorthair cat is sweet and affectionate without being needy or clingy. This breed hails from the United Kingdom where it developed naturally and was the region's original domestic shorthaired cat. Originally, many British shorthairs were blue colored (a gray hue), but today's British shorthair comes in a veritable rainbow of colors and patterns, including solid, bicolor, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and more. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>OTHER NAMES: British blue.</p><p>PERSONALITY: Affectionate, easy-going, and calm.</p><p>WEIGHT: About 7 to 17 pounds, with males slightly larger.</p><p>LENGTH: About 22 to 25 inches. </p><p>COAT LENGTH: Short and very dense. Not double coated or woolly.</p><p>COAT COLOR: Many solid and patterned colors, including white, black, blue, red, cream, smoke, silver, golden, cameo, tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, and bicolor.</p><p>EYE COLOR: Varies depending on coat color and pattern, but may be blue, gold, copper, green, blue-green, hazel or odd-eyed (eyes of two different colors).</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 12 to 16 years.</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No.</p><p>ORIGIN: United Kingdom.</p><h3>Characteristics of the British shorthair Cat</h3><p>The British shorthair is a big cat not massive like the Maine Coon or Siberian cat but some male British shorthairs can weigh as much as 17 pounds (females usually top off at 12 pounds or less). The British shorthair is a wonderful family cat the breed has an easy-going personality and generally gets along with everyone, including kids and other animals living in the house. They are active without being hyper, tend to be quiet, and can live happily in almost any size house, including apartments. </p><h3>History of the British Shorthair Cat</h3><p>The British shorthair is possibly the oldest cat breed in Great Britain. The most agreed-upon theory of this breed's development is that British shorthairs started out as shorthaired street cats, but breeders refined and standardized the cats until they resembled the British shorthair we know and love today. British shorthairs were among the breeds exhibited at England's first organized cat show in 1871. Back then, the breed was called the British Blue, owning to the fact that blue (gray) was very common color in the breed, especially early on.</p><p>Although blue British shorthairs are still popular today, they come in many different colors and patterns. The British shorthair was first brought to the United States in the early 1900s, but they were called domestic shorthairs. The British shorthair was formally recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association in 1980. Today, this popular breed can be found throughout the world. </p><h3>British Shorthair Cat Care </h3><p>As the breed name suggests, the British shorthair has a short coat that needs only minimal grooming. Brush your British shorthair once a week using a soft slicker brush. Brush more frequently during periods of seasonal shedding to remove loose hair before it ends up all over the house.</p><p>Trim the nails every other week and check inside the ears weekly. If you see a little debris in the ears, use a pet-ear cleaner and cotton balls to clean the ears using a cotton ball (never use a cotton swab). If your British shorthair's ears look red or excessively dirty, make an appointment to see your veterinarian.</p><p>British Shorthairs are playful well into adulthood, but they are not hyper or excessively active. They can get plenty of exercise by exploring the house and playing with you a few times a day. Engage your British Shorthair with feather wands, toy mice, and any other favorite toys. Make sure your cat has plenty of things to climb and perch upon like cat trees, cat-friendly bookshelves, and kitty condos. Cats can also get exercise and enrichment through scratching. Set up several acceptable scratching places in the house, including vertical scratchers (such as tall posts or cat trees) and horizontal scratchers (such as cardboard or sisal scratchers that lie flat on the ground).<br/></p><h3>Common Health Problems</h3><p>British shorthairs are a notably healthy breed that are rarely affected by genetic disease. Among genetic illnesses, they are most prone to heart disease specifically hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Of course, any can become sick, injured, or develop a health condition. For that reason, it's important to visit your veterinarian at least once a year for a physical exam to ensure your cat is healthy and to stay on top of any developing health concerns. <br/></p><h3>Appearance</h3><p>The British shorthair is a medium-to-large-sized cat with a compact, well-balanced, and powerful body. Female British shorthairs are slightly smaller than males. One of the hallmarks of the breed is its round head, with round cheeks, a firm chin, medium-sized ears, and large, round eyes. The British shorthair's coat is short and dense. The British shorthair has a single coat, with no undercoat. Although blue (gray) British shorthairs are common, the breed can some in many different colors and patterns. <br/></p><h3>Diet and Nutrition</h3><p>British shorthairs are solidly built, but it's best to keep them at a lean, healthy weight in order to prevent weight-related health issues, such as diabetes and heart disease, which can affect any cat but may be compounded by excess weight. Feed your adult British shorthair measured meals twice a day (three times a day for young kittens). Don't free feed (leave food out all day). This practice can lead to overeating and weight gain. Talk to your veterinarian or the breeder you worked with for advice about the best food for your cat.<br/></p><h3>Where to Adopt or Buy a British Shorthair Cat</h3><p>The British shorthair is a somewhat popular cat breed. The Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association both list active British shorthair breeders on their respective websites. </p><p>A fun way to meet British shorthair breeders and see cats of many different breeds is attending a local cat show. Newbies are very welcome at cat shows, and breeders enjoy educating people about their breed. To find a local cat show, search the internet for ""cat show near me."" British shorthairs rarely end up in animal shelters, but you can ask local British shorthair breeders if they know of any adult British shorthairs in need of new homes.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>The British shorthair is slow to mature, both physically and mentally. These cats generally don't achieve their final size and weight until somewhere between 3 and 5 years old. British shorthairs may continue to display kitten-ish energy and playfulness until they reach maturity, but once fully mature, this breed is calm and well behaved.</p><p>They are affectionate without being needy and are accepting of strangers, though they may be a bit aloof until they get to know you better.

Although somewhat uncommon in the United States, this breed has many qualities that make it a superb companion. It is typically very affectionate, playful, and loyal with its family, and it excels at training. Plus, it's an excellent breed for people with an active lifestyle who like spending lots of time outdoors. However, it might not be ideal for some first-time dog owners, as it needs lots of mental stimulation and exercise. And it has strong protective and herding instincts.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 15.75 to 18 inches (female), 17.5 to 19.75 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 31 to 40 pounds (female), 40 to 49 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Medium length, curly, corded</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, black and white, brown, brown and white</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Active, alert, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Spain</p><h2>Characteristics of the Spanish Water Dog</h2><p>High energy is the cornerstone of the Spanish water dog's personality. These dogs generally have an upbeat temperament, and they like having a job to do. They are also quite smart and eager to learn.</p><h2>History of the Spanish Water Dog</h2><p>The origin of the Spanish water dog is unclear, as it has existed in parts of Spain primarily the Iberian Peninsula for hundreds of years. It's possible that its ancestors came from Northern Africa, though another theory suggests the dog came by way of Turkish traders.</p><p>People in the area needed a dog that was adaptable to different weather conditions. They also wanted a breed that could work in a variety of roles, including herding, swimming/waterfowl retrieval, and protection. And the Spanish water dog fit the bill on all counts. </p><p>The breed dipped in popularity toward the end of the 1900s as machines had replaced many of its jobs. However, breeders worked to preserve its traits. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 2015.</p><h2>Spanish Water Dog Care</h2><p>It is crucial that a Spanish water dog gets ample daily exercise to keep it happy and healthy. Likewise, it needs consistent training to make sure it's a well-mannered dog. Plus, it does have some particular grooming needs, though they aren't overly time-consuming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Spanish water dogs have a lot of physical and mental energy to burn. They should receive at least one to two hours of exercise per day via long walks, running, hiking, swimming, vigorous games of fetch, and more. They can make excellent companions for people who want a dog for jogging. And ideally they should be allowed to stretch their legs running and playing in a secure area off leash, too. They also excel in dog sports, including agility and dock diving, which can challenge them physically and mentally. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Spanish water dog's low-shedding coat doesn't require a lot of maintenance, but its care is somewhat atypical. Traditionally, the coat is never brushed, combed, blow-dried, or trimmed. Instead, it is sheared to the skin as necessary, just like a sheep. Some owners let it grow out to a moderate length before shearing while others allow the curly hair to grow longer and form its natural cords. Depending on your preferences, you often can go several months before the coat needs shearing.</p><p>Maintaining the cords does take some work, as they must be separated to prevent mats. Also, bathing a dog with a corded coat is different from bathing a typical dog. You must use a mild shampoo (no conditioner) and gently squeeze the shampoo into the coat rather than rub or scrub. To rinse, you must again squeeze the coat gently as the water runs through it. To dry, blot the coat with a towel (no rubbing), and then simply let it air dry.  </p><p>Beyond that, check your dog's nails roughly every four to six weeks to see whether they need a trim. And aim to brush its teeth daily. Also, look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and any abnormalities. Make sure to dry the ears well after your dog goes swimming. <br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Spanish water dogs are highly intelligent and have excellent problem-solving skills. They respond well to positive training methods, such as clicker training that uses plenty of tasty treats and praise. Harsh corrections can cause them to shut down and not learn. Begin training as young as possible to prevent these smart dogs from learning they can get away with bad habits. </p><p>Moreover, start socialization when your dog is a puppy by exposing it to different people, other dogs, and various locations. Positive experiences can go a long way to help quell this dog's protective instinct and teach it to be comfortable and confident. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Overall, Spanish water dogs are hardy and healthy. But they are prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's common to feed two measured meals per day, rather than leaving food out all day, to ensure your dog gets proper nutrition. But be sure to discuss the type of diet and the amount with your vet.</p><p>Some Spanish water dogs are prone to food allergies, so your vet might recommend a special diet. Plus, very active Spanish water dogs might require a performance diet that has more calories and fat. Always keep an eye on treats and other extra food to prevent your dog from overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Spanish Water Dog</h2><p>The Spanish water dog is a rare breed, so it might be difficult to find one. Still, it's worth checking animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. If you're looking for a reputable breeder puppy, expect to pay around $1,500 to $2,500, though this can vary widely depending on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Spanish Water Dog Overview</h2><p>Intelligent and easy to train</p><p>Watchful and protective</p><p>Minimal shedding</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise </p><p>Not always friendly with strangers</p><p>Not the best choice for young children</p>",991

Cane corsos are powerful dogs that may seem intimidating to some. These fearless and vigilant dogs are not right for everyone. However, these gentle giants are often misunderstood and can actually make excellent companions. For those who like the idea of a very large dog that is protective and athletic, the cane corso is one to consider.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Cane Corso</h2><p>Despite its appearance, which some might find intimidating, the cane corso can be affectionate and gentle. This breed will bond deeply with its family and act as a protector. With proper handling and socialization, the cane corso can get along well with children, even forming a close bond. However, children must also be taught how to behave around dogs and never be left unsupervised.</p><h2>History of the Cane Corso</h2><p>The cane corso originated in Italy and can be traced back to ancient times. The molossus, a now extinct mastiff-type dog, is an ancestor of the cane corso and similar mastiff-type dogs. Throughout its early history, the cane corso acted as a guard dog, war dog, and skilled hunter of various game (including very large game). Its name is derived from the Italian word for dog, , and the Latin term , which means ""protector"" or ""guardian.""</p><p>A significant decline of the cane corso breed was brought on by World Wars I and II, but small numbers of the dogs still existed. During the 1970s, cane corso enthusiasts sparked a revival of the breed. The first cane corso dogs arrived in the U.S. in 1988. The breed was admitted to the AKC miscellaneous class in 2007 and received full recognition into the AKC working group in 2010.</p><h2>Cane Corso Care</h2><p>Exercise and training are most important to a cane corso, and happily, grooming requirements are basic. A cane corso needs a sturdy, high fence when allowed outdoors. The breed has a high prey drive and is prone to chasing and killing small animals such as cats and other dogs. They are territorial and will patrol the fence line, protecting the property from passersby.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>A true working breed, the cane corso is active and driven. Daily exercise will help keep the cane corso physically and mentally fit. Brisk walking or jogging for at least a mile is a good start, so plan on spending a minimum of 30 minutes a day exercising together.</p><p>If you don't have a job for a cane corso to do, it might find its own and end up digging holes and chewing your belongings. If you have a farm, the dog can herd livestock. If you own a business, have your dog greet customers. But if you are a more typical homeowner, spend time each day with a dog sport, learning tricks, or practicing obedience skills.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The cane corso has a short, coarse coat and is typically just a light shedder. Grooming needs are very basic just occasional brushing and bathing as needed. Like other large dogs, the cane corso might have nails that wear down naturally. However, occasional nail trims may be necessary. Check the length of your dog's nails on a regular basis so it can remain comfortable and mobile.</p><p>The ears of the cane corso are often cropped into an equilateral triangle, but this is not a requirement according to the breed standard. The tail is typically docked at the fourth vertebra.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Proper training and socialization are essential for all cane corsos. With a natural aversion to strangers and a tendency to be territorial, you must be diligent and consistent while training. This is also crucial because of the dog's giant size so careful attention should be placed upon prevention of jumping, leaning, and leash-pulling. The cane corso is intelligent and hard-working, so it should not be difficult for this breed to learn.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>An adult cane corso will need 4 to 5 cups of dry dog food per day. It's best to divide it into two meals to help reduce the risk of bloating and stomach torsion. Be sure to assess whether your dog is getting overweight. If you note weight gain, ask your veterinarian whether you need to change the feeding schedule, amount, type of food, and exercise routine.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cane Corso</h2><p>If you think the cane corso could be right for you, try to locate cane corso breeders and owners in your area so you can spend some time with the breed first. Also, consider searching for a cane corso rescue group to adopt. Make sure you understand what is necessary to properly care for this breed before you bring one into your life. Begin your search through the Cane Corso Association of America. Expect to pay on average of $1,500 for a puppy, but the cost can skyrocket to thousands more for a pedigreed cane corso pup.</p><p>Check with your local animal shelter and rescue groups to see if there's a cane corso available for adoption. Large- and giant-breed rescue groups such as Big Dogs Huge Paws Inc. or Cane Corso Rescue may have cane corsos available to adopt.</p><h2>Cane Corso Overview</h2><p>Forms a close bond with family members</p><p>Makes a good watchdog</p><p>An easy-to-maintain coat that doesn't need much grooming</p><p>Needs significant exercise and obedience training</p><p>At risk for joint problems and hip dysplasia, due to size</p><p>Larger-than-average size can be difficult for small people and children to handle</p>",934

The breed is notable for its solid blue-gray coat with a slightly woolly texture and bright copper eyes.</p><p>The muscular and athletic Chartreux has small, fine-boned legs for the size of its body, and it can appear to be rather short in stature. But, the cat is a mighty mouser legend has it that French Carthusian monks employed Chartreux cats for rodent control in monasteries.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Calm, friendly, docile</p><p>Weight: Up to 16 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 24 inches, nose to tail</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Gray</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid</p><p>Eye Color: Copper/orange</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Chartreux Characteristics</h2><p>With its quiet but friendly temperament, the medium-sized Chartreux is a lovely companion for individuals or families, but it can be a tough feline to find as the breed is rare in the United States.</p><p>This cat rarely makes vocal demands, but those familiar with the breed describe it as an excellent communicator with an engaging manner. When it does have something to say, the Chartreux may chirp to get noticed.</p><p>The Chartreux's round face and pointed muzzle make it appear to be smiling, and owners of Chartreux cats who know the breed's happy, friendly personality find this ""smile"" easy to believe.</p><h2>History of the Chartreux</h2><p>The early origin of the Chartreux is difficult to trace, though it's well-established that the breed dates back at least to the 15<sup>th</sup>or 16<sup>th</sup>century. The unique woolly coat of these cats points back to Syrian roots, and it is commonly believed that Crusaders returning from Syria to France brought the early ancestors of the Chartreux.</p><p>Once in France, the breed proved to be an excellent means of controlling rodent populations. Many accounts of the Chartreux's history point to French Carthusian monasteries keeping these cats as a defense against rats and mice. While no Carthusian records confirm this fact, it's a much-repeated tale that also is said to explain the quiet, almost monastic nature of these nearly silent cats.</p><p>Moving forward in history, the Chartreux cat becomes easier to trace. Sometime in the 1920s, sisters Christine and Suzanne Leger encountered a colony of blue-gray cats living on a small island off the coast of France. The cats were notable for their striking appearance and unique woolly coat, so the Leger sisters decided to domesticate and breed them. In 1931, the cats were on a display at a cat show in Paris where the modern Chartreux cat became recognizable.</p><p>Like many breeds, the Chartreux's existence was threatened by World War II. However, selective crossbreeding with Russian blue, British shorthair, and Persian cats ensured that this centuries-old cat didn't disappear.</p><p>While first prized for its hunting prowess, the modern Chartreux became popular for its beautiful woolly coat, intelligence, and calm, friendly demeanor. Not surprisingly, cat breeders around the world took notice. In 1970, John and Helen Gamon brought the first Chartreux cats to the United States. This paved the way for the breed's full acceptance into the Cat Fancier's Association in 1987.</p><p>Today, the Chartreux is something of a national French treasure. Beloved by the people of France, the breed is relatively hard to find outside of Europe. Many breeding programs in the United States have returned their stock to France, making it difficult to find a purebred kitten here in the states.</p><h2>Chartreux Care</h2><p>The Chartreux is an easy keeper that is relatively self-sufficient but will happily engage in play. It enjoys the company of children and other pets but doesn't require constant attention.</p><p>This cat breed is highly intelligent, so challenge your Chartreux with learning tricks or treat puzzles. Some curious Chartreux cats have even been known to open cupboards, so keep kitty treats hidden away and consider installing toddler locks on cabinet doors if this becomes a problem.</p><p>The soft, woolly character of the Chartreux's coat makes it easy to care for. Many experts warn against brushing it since its unique texture is more suited to the action of a comb instead of a bristle brush. While the Chartreux does an excellent job of grooming itself, the extra attention will keep mats from forming and serve as good bonding time for you and your feline friend.</p><p>Several times a year, the Chartreux will shed his undercoat. During this time, you may want to comb it every day to keep the flying fur under control. But, you shouldn't need to bathe your cat very often.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Chartreux has relatively few health problems and is a hearty, robust breed.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Chartreux has a solid blue-gray coat with a slightly woolly texture and bright copper-orange eyes. With its muscular build, the Chartreux may look like it has small legs for the size of its body, and its body length is often greater than its height. While the cat may appear disproportionate at first glance, its powerfully athletic nature is impressive to anyone who watches it hunt or play.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Chartreux should be fed a nutritious diet and care should be taken not to overfeed. With a tendency toward developing struvite crystals, be sure that you work with your veterinarian to choose a food that isn't too alkaline (many plant-based foods contribute to high levels of alkalinity).</p><p>Also, be sure that your cat has easy access to fresh drinking water at all times. If your cat doesn't take in enough water, urine becomes more concentrated and struvite crystals can develop. If this is the case with your cat, consider incorporating wet food to add moisture to the diet.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Chartreux</h2><p>Finding a Chartreux cat to call your own may not be easy because breeders in the United States are few and far between. However, the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) Breeder Directory and The International Cat Association (TICA) Breeder Directory are good places to start your search.</p><p>Since these cats are such treasures, it is rare to find one in a shelter. However, it happens owners give up beloved pets for many reasons.</p><h2>Chartreux Cat Overview</h2><p>A calm demeanor is a key characteristic of the Chartreux, so they're a popular cat breed for solitary owners and families. Just be sure that children or other pets are taught to treat the cat gently and with respect. Interestingly, these cats are also known to be adaptable; many enjoy traveling with their owners. </p><p>Friendly and docile; not overly demanding</p><p>Good with kids and pets</p><p>Adaptable, travels well</p><p>Difficult to find a breeder</p><p>Prone to kidney problems</p><p>May get bored without sufficient stimulation</p>",1080

Their petite size makes them a particularly alluring breed for pet owners who want a sporty dog that isn't overwhelmingly large or domineering. For the majority of their existence, Cirnechi (the plural of Cirneco) were only found in Italy, and the breed is still considered rare in the United States.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 18 to 19.5 inches at the shoulder (male), 16.5 to 18 inches at the shoulder (female)</p><p>Weight: 22 to 26 pounds (male), 17 to 22 pounds (female)</p><p>Coat: Very short and smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Chestnut or tan, occasionally with patches of white around the neck and shoulders</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Gentle, affectionate, calm, active, loyal, independent, sweet-tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Cirneco dell'Etna</h2><p>Cirnechi were originally bred as fast-moving hunting dogs, but they can be calm, low-maintenance house dogs, perfect for active owners or families with older children. Although Cirnechi can get along with other pets, it's best to start socialization early and introduce them very slowly. Cirnechi are considered high energy and need at least 30 minutes to one hour of exercise every day. They aren't very tolerant of being left alone, either, so if your family has a very busy schedule or if you're away from the home often, you may want to consider a different breed.</p><h2>History of the Cirneco dell'Etna</h2><p>The word ""Cirneco"" comes from the Greek word ""Kyrenaikos,"" meaning ""of Cyrene,"" an ancient Greek city near modern-day Libya; ""dell'Etna"" comes from Mount Etna in Sicily. Accordingly, it's believed the Cirneco dell'Etna originated in Sicily and were propagated by dogs that traveled on Phoenician merchant ships. They were originally used to hunt smaller game, like rabbits and hares.</p><p>The Cirneco dell'Etna is often described as resembling the Pharaoh Hounds depicted in ancient Egyptian art. While Cirnechi aren't as old as ancient Egyptian dogs, they are one of the older breeds Sicilian coins dating back to 500 BC show depictions of dogs that resemble today's Cirneco dell'Etna.</p><p>Prior to 1932, Cirnechi were typically only found on the island of Sicily. Then, a veterinarian named Maurizio Migneco visited Sicily and wrote an article covering the declining Cirnechi population. An Italian aristocrat named Baroness Agata Paternó Castello read Migneco's article and felt moved to revive the breed. She made it her life goal to increase Cirnechi populations, and worked to do so until she died.</p><p>The Cirneco dell'Etna was recognized by the Italian National Kennel Club in 1939, but wouldn't be recognized by the American Kennel Club until 2015. Today, the Cirneco dell'Etna is still somewhat rare in the United States, ranking 183rd out of 195 breeds.</p><h2>Cirneco dell'Etna Care</h2><p>Cirnechi have pretty minimal needs, and won't require much-specialized care in order to thrive. As with all dogs, make sure you have the ability to play with them often and spend ample time together. Cirnechi can be especially susceptible to anxiety when left alone, so if you plan on being out for the day make sure to give them TLC before leaving and after returning home.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Cirneco dell'Etna has high energy levels and even higher exercise needs. For this breed, a lack of exercise can lead to quick weight gain. Aim for at least 30 minutes to an hour of walking each day, with active play sessions in-between. They're also intelligent dogs, so incorporating mental stimulation, like puzzles, into their daily routine can keep them engaged and stimulated.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Thanks to their short, smooth coats, Cirnechi have minimal grooming needs. Brush your Cirneco with a soft brush or a hound mat once per week, and bathe them as needed. Though they do shed a bit, Cirnechi are considered a good choice for people with allergies.</p><p>Cirnechi have ears that stick straight up, so it's important to examine the ears several times per week. You can use a soft, cotton cloth to gently remove any dirt, debris, or waxy build-up. Avoid cotton swabs, as they can damage the delicate inner-ear structures. If your dog's ears are red, inflamed, or smell funny, make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible, as these may be signs of infection</p><p>Like all dog breeds, it's important to keep your Cirneco's teeth and gums healthy. Daily tooth brushing is ideal, but brushing your dog's teeth even once per week can help protect him or her against oral disease.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Cirnechi are intelligent dogs and are considered easy to train if the trainer uses food-based rewards and positive reinforcement. You can try do-it-yourself dog training or find a local trainer who can help you. Early socialization is also vital in Cirnechi, especially if you plan to introduce him or her to another pet or want to frequent local dog parks often.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Cirneco dell'Etna is generally considered a hardy, healthy dog and there are no recommended health tests from the American Kennel Club. There's no guarantee that your dog will or won't develop certain health conditions, so it's important to talk to your veterinarian about the steps you can take to ensure your dog lives a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Cirnechi are prone to weight gain if overfed, which can lead to serious health issues, like heart disease and diabetes. Look for a dog food that's formulated for highly active, medium-sized breeds. You can refer to the feeding guide from your preferred dog food brand to determine exactly how much to feed your Cirneco or ask your veterinarian.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cirneco dell'Etna</h2><p>If you decide to purchase a Cirneco dell'Etna from a breeder, be sure to work with a reputable, ethical breeder. If possible, visit the breeding site and look out for the signs of backyard breeding. Ask lots of questions and try to meet the parents of your litter. Expect that any breeder you find may have a waiting list for puppies.</p><h2>Cirneco dell'Etna Overview</h2><p>Calm and good-natured</p><p>Easy to groom and can be suitable for those with allergies</p><p>Can thrive in smaller spaces</p><p>High energy and high exercise needs</p><p>Needs early socialization and slow introductions with other pets</p><p>Can be difficult to find from a breeder or adoption agency</p>",1021

Also known as Yorkies, these dogs have tenacious but affectionate personalities. They tend to be very vocal, protective, and loyal. And, despite their small size, they can make excellent guard dogs. But, at heart, Yorkies are wonderful companions that enjoy pampering and snuggling up to their loved ones.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 7 to 8 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 7 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, silky</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black and gold, black and tan, blue and gold, or blue and tan</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, bright, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Little Yet Bold Yorkie</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Yorkshire Terrier</h2><p>Despite their diminutive size, most Yorkies have a big personality. They generally have an affectionate yet feisty temperament. They love to snuggle, but they also can be very active, playful, and vigilant.</p><h2>History of the Yorkshire Terrier</h2><p>Yorkshire terriers can be traced back to the migration of weavers from Scotland to Yorkshire, England, in the mid-19th century. These people brought a variety of terriers with them, which they used to control rodents in textile mills. They preferred a small terrier that could squeeze into tight spaces after the rodents. And several breeds, including the Skye terrier and Dandie Dinmont, went into creating the little Yorkie. </p><p>In 1886, the Kennel Club of England recognized the breed. And this changed its reputation from primarily being a working-class exterminator to a fashionable companion. Breeders also further decreased its size, so it could better serve its purpose as a lapdog. </p><p>Yorkies also made their way to the United States in the late 1800s. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1885, and it's been quite a popular dog throughout U.S. history. President Richard Nixon's family even had a Yorkie that resided in the White House.</p><h2>Yorkshire Terrier Care</h2><p>Yorkies are more than just lap dogs. This breed can be quite vocal and stubborn at times. Early training and socialization with people and other dogs are important for the Yorkie and can help keep that big personality from getting out of control. Regular grooming also is essential to keep a Yorkie looking and feeling its best.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Yorkies are no couch potato. They are active little dogs that need regular exercise and mental stimulation to keep them happy and healthy. Aim to provide two 15- to 30-minute walks per day. Going at a moderate pace should be sufficient for a Yorkie to burn off energy. Yorkies also should be able to run and play off leash. Games of fetch and other dog sports, such as agility, will help to give a Yorkie mental stimulation along with exercise.</p><p>Yorkies are not well-suited to extreme temperatures, hot or cold, so plan outdoor exercise accordingly. Try to go out during the coolest part of the day in hot weather, and provide a sweater or coat in cold weather. Indoor play is also a good option, as Yorkies don't need much room to work out their little bodies.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Yorkies are known to be low-shedders. They have silky, continuously growing hair that requires a fair amount of grooming. If the coat is kept long, it should be brushed daily to prevent tangles and mats. It also will need regular trims to prevent it from dragging, and the hair on the dog's head should either be cut short or put in a hairband to keep it out of the dog's eyes. To avoid this hassle, many Yorkie owners choose to keep their dog's coat short (usually cut by a groomer every several weeks).</p><p>Plan on a bath every week or two, and check your dog's ears at least weekly for any dirt and debris. Nail trims will be necessary roughly every month, depending on how much your dog wears down its nails. And teeth ideally should be brushed every day.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Yorkies are bright little dogs that can take to training fairly well, though they can be bossy at times. Still, they tend to respond very well to positive reinforcement. Aim to start training when your Yorkie is still a puppy to prevent bad habits from forming and to socialize it with various people, other animals, and situations. Attending a puppy obedience class as soon as your dog meets the age requirement is a good option for both training and socialization. </p><p>The breed is known to be difficult to housebreak in part because Yorkies can be stubborn and often don't like to go outside in inclement weather. Be patient and consistent during this process to reinforce good housebreaking habits.</p><p>Furthermore, many Yorkies don't do well when they're left alone for most of the day. They prefer lots of attention and companionship and might develop separation anxiety and bad habits if their social needs aren't met. However, they don't always make good companions for young children, who might be too rough with the little dog and provoke it to nip.<br/></p><p> </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Yorkshire terriers are generally healthy dogs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Select a quality, nutritionally balanced dog food for your Yorkie. Kibble that's sized for small breeds often is ideal. Discuss any diet, including the quantity to feed, with your vet, as this can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. Always make sure to factor treats into your dog's daily caloric consumption to prevent overeating. And provide fresh water at all times. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Yorkshire Terrier</h2><p>If you think you'd like to adopt a Yorkshire terrier, look at local animal shelters and breed-specific rescues for dogs in need of a home. For a Yorkie puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $2,000 or more; the cost can widely vary based on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Yorkshire Terrier Overview</h2><p>Good watch dog</p><p>Affectionate and loyal</p><p>Energetic and entertaining</p><p>Needs lots of grooming</p><p>Can be difficult to housebreak</p><p>Can be loud</p>",968

These breeds, including the rare German spitz, have thick double coats (a longer outer coat combined with a shorter, thicker undercoat), a wedge-shaped head, upright triangular ears, and a long tail that curls up and over the back. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: Klein (miniature): 9 to 11.5 inches tall at the shoulder; Mittel (medium): 12 to 15 inches tall</p><p>WEIGHT: Weight corresponds to size; about 25 to 40 pounds</p><p>COAT: A straight and stand-off outer coat paired with a short, soft, dense undercoat</p><p>COAT COLOR: All colors and markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Lively, devoted, attentive, trainable, entertaining</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the German Spitz</h2><p>The German spitz is a lively and entertaining family pet. Happy and outgoing with people it knows, the dog is naturally suspicious of strangers and will bark to alert you to anyone approaching the home. A German spitz is extremely devoted to its owners. The breed is playful, adoring, and simply fun to have around.</p><h2>History of the German Spitz</h2><p>Originally a farm dog, watchdog, and companion dog, the German spitz is one of several closely related spitz breeds that have been known in Germany since the mid-1400s. In the breed's home country, there is one German spitz with five varieties; in other parts of the world these varieties are recognized as separate breeds. The five varieties are the Giant spitz, Wolfsspitz (recognized as keeshond in other countries), Mittel spitz (medium), Klein spitz (miniature), and Zwergspitz (toy, recognized as the Pomeranian in other countries). </p><p>Although the breed's history goes back hundreds of years and is well-known in Germany, this breed is a relative newcomer to the dog scene in the United States. It's not yet recognized by the American Kennel Club, but it's part of the AKC Foundation Stock Service, which is the first step toward eventual full recognition. The German spitz is fully recognized by the United Kennel Club, where it is part of the Northern Breeds group. The breed is also recognized by the international kennel club Fédération Cynologique International.</p><h2>German Spitz Care</h2><p>This sweet and cute breed is easy to live with and care for, and especially ideal for first-time owners. A German spitz is energetic and loves to play, but it doesn't need hours of exercise. Despite its abundance, the dog's profuse coat is easier to care for than you might expect. The breed is highly intelligent easy to train. Although some German spitzes are small in size, don't get into the habit of carrying your dog everywhere like a baby or it can't fully experience its world like a dog.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Get into the habit of taking your German spitz on daily strolls around the neighborhood and sessions of fetch in a safely enclosed yard. This dog only requires between 30 minutes to an hour of daily exercise to stay happy. This isn't the type of dog you can take on long, vigorous runs or hikes, however, because it can become too winded.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>German spitz should not be trimmed or shaved, and the coat usually looks and feels clean because the hair naturally repels dirt. Seasonally about twice a year, the German spitz experiences a heavy shed, cropping much of the undercoat in a few weeks (this is appropriately called ""blowing coat""). Double down on your brushing during this time to remove the shedding hair. A moistening bath and blow-dry can also help work out more hair. Outside of these seasonal sheds, the breed sheds very little and needs only weekly brushing. A weekly nail trim and look into the ears (clean with a pet ear cleaner if they look dirty) will help your dog stay comfortable.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>A German spitz is highly intelligent and easy to train. It truly wants to please you and can be taught many tricks and basic commands using positive reinforcement like treats and toys. This breed is not inherently aggressive or nervous around people or other dogs, but it should begin socializing early by exposing the puppy to many different people, places, and things to help develop its confidence. Sometimes a German spitz can become a problem barker and extra training (especially teaching the ""quiet"" command) can help curb this tendency. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although the German spitz is an extremely healthy breed, some instances of eye disease have been noted in the breed, including progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) and retinal dysplasia. Some dogs might develop luxating patellas (loose kneecaps). Reputable breeders have special eye and knee screenings done on their adult German spitz before breeding them to avoid passing these issues to future generations. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your German spitz a high-quality dog food (if you need a recommendation, talk to your breeder or veterinarian). Smaller German spitz might benefit from a small-breed or ""small-bite"" food, which has smaller kibbles for smaller mouths. Always portion out meals on a schedule (twice daily for adults) with a measuring cup or scale to avoid overfeeding. Leaving food out all day, although convenient, can lead to weight gain. Too much weight can place extra strain on the joints and contribute to other health problems like diabetes. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy</h2><p>The German spitz is a very rare breed in North America. A breed club, the German Spitz Club of America, is seeking full AKC recognition for the breed. It can be difficult to find a puppy because there are few breeders in the United States and reputable breeders breed few litters a year. If you find a breeder, be prepared to get on a waiting list for a puppy. Though many experts will say that you can expect to pay under $1,000 for a German spitz pup, some breeders may charge upwards of a few thousand dollars per dog, too.</p><h2>German Spitz Overview</h2><p>Devoted family companion</p><p>Clean, easy-care coat</p><p>Good apartment dog</p><p>Some may be problem barkers</p><p>May be wary of strangers</p><p>Doesn't do well when left alone</p>",997

Exotic shorthairs are soft, medium-sized cats that tend to develop strong bonds with their owners, get along with other pets and kids, and have sweet personalities. Although exotic shorthairs have relatively low energy levels and exercise needs, they'll happily play with fishing pole feather teasers or similar toys for hours.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, loyal, easygoing, low-energy,</p><p>Weight: Up to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 30 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Black, white, golden, silver, smoke, bicolor, and Himalayan</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, pointed, tabby, and tortoiseshell</p><p>Eye Color: Gold, green, and blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Exotic Shorthair Characteristics</h2><p>Exotic shorthairs have lower energy levels than many other cats, so they can thrive in a variety of households and don't require a lot of active interaction or stimulation. The exotic shorthair's sweet, relaxed, and playful personality as well as its low-maintenance grooming and exercise needs make it the perfect pick for first-time cat owners and mellow families.</p><h2>History of the Exotic Shorthair</h2><p>Persian cats have been and still are some of the most coveted cats in history. Motivated by the popularity of the breed, American shorthair breeders began to mix Persians, Burmese, and Russian blues into their American shorthair lines sometime during the 1950s. They hoped to recreate the beautiful looks of the Persian in American shorthairs.</p><p>Although the first litters of Persian-American shorthair kittens didn't look like Persians, they retained some of the key characteristics like round faces, short noses, and large, round eyes. But. they had shorter, more plush coats. Many breeders then bred these kittens with Persians to further develop the exotic shorthair breed.</p><p>As the breed grew in popularity and the gene pool broadened fewer breeds incorporated Burmese and Russian blues into their breeding programs to achieve shorter, plusher coats. Eventually, the Cat Fanciers' Association began to limit the number of outcrosses allowed in purebred exotic shorthairs. In 1987, they banned exotic shorthair outcrosses completely, allowing them only to be bred with Persians.</p><p>Today, the exotic shorthair is one of the most popular purebred shorthair cats, ranking second to the Persian.</p><h2>Exotic Shorthair Care</h2><p>Unlike Persians, exotic shorthairs are extremely easy to groom. While Persians require daily brushing and combing, you can expect to comb an exotic shorthair's coat once or twice per week with a steel comb. Mats, knots, and tangles are uncommon in the exotic shorthair. The exotic shorthair sheds seasonally, so it needs additional grooming and bathing to remove dead hair and skin cells during this time.</p><p>Because exotic shorthairs have flatter faces, their eyes tend to tear and stain the surrounding fur. You can prevent staining by washing your exotic's face daily with a soft, dry cloth. If your cat's eyes are red, crusty, or have excessive discharge, make an appointment with your veterinarian to investigate the possibility of an eye infection.</p><p>As with every breed, you should examine your cat's ears weekly. You can clean away waxy build-up and debris with a soft, cotton cloth. Avoid using a cotton swab, as they can damage the delicate, inner-ear structures. If your cat's ears are red, inflamed, or smell funny, see your veterinarian. These may be signs of infection.</p><p>The exotic shorthair has a fairly low energy level and doesn't require a lot of exercises. It is content to play an occasional low-key game with toys, and then lounge or cuddle for hours.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Ethical breeders take steps to ensure they're producing healthy cats, but there's no guarantee that your exotic shorthair will not develop a health condition at some point.</p><p>Polycystic kidney disease: Otherwise known as PKD, this condition is characterized by enlarged kidneys and improper kidney function. Cysts are typically seen in affected cats by 12 months of age, but kidney failure can occur years later. There are DNA tests that can identify PKD, so ask your cat's breeder for proof that the mother and father have been cleared.</p><p>Respiratory issues: Because exotic shorthairs have flattened faces, they can have difficulty breathing especially in hot, humid weather. Your exotic shorthair should always be kept in a climate-controlled environment.</p><p>If you're concerned about your exotic shorthair's health, talk to your veterinarian about ways you can help your cat live a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Aside from their drastically different coats, the exotic shorthair and Persian are bred to the same standards. Exotic shorthairs have flattened faces, small ears, and short legs. Unlike the Persian, though the exotic's coat is short, dense, and plush.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your cat's diet and nutritional needs will depend largely on its age, sex, size, and activity levels. If you're unsure how much or how often to feed your exotic shorthair, your veterinarian can help you develop a healthy, balanced diet for him. You can also consult the feeding guides developed by your preferred cat food brand.</p><p>Overfeeding your cat can lead to obesity, which causes health problems. Leaving food out at all times can encourage too much snacking, so providing the appropriate amount of food at scheduled times during the day can help manage a cat's weight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Exotic Shorthair</h2><p>Although it may be extremely difficult to find an exotic shorthair kitten at your local shelter or rescue group, you may be able to find an adult exotic. Reach out to your local shelter, rescue groups, or even your veterinarian to see if there are any adoptable exotic shorthairs in your area.</p><p>If you choose to work with a breeder, look for one that has performed and has proof of all health certifications. Avoid breeders that always have litters available, have multiple litters on the premises, or allow you to pay for your cat over the internet. These are all signs of a potentially unethical breeder.</p><h2>Exotic Shorthair Overview</h2><p>Exotic shorthairs make perfect pets for people who love Persians but don't want the commitment of high-maintenance grooming. These cats are also easygoing and low energy, so they don't demand constant attention or frequent interactive activities they are content to cuddle.</p><p>Like any pet, it's important to do your research and ensure an exotic shorthair is the right pick for your family's lifestyle. The exotic shorthair has a loving, loyal, and calm personality, making it an enjoyable companion for just about everyone who doesn't need an energetic playmate.</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>Looks a lot like a Persian cat</p><p>Doesn't need a lot of exercise</p><p>Prone to respiratory and kidney problems</p><p>Doesn't have the long, luxurious coat of a Persian</p><p>May not be energetic or fun enough for kids</p>",1085

Goldendoodles vary in size, depending on the size of their parents, because poodles can be miniature or medium-sized. The breed typically has curly, hypoallergenic hair and hardly sheds thanks to its non-shedding poodle ancestors. Goldendoodles are highly intelligent, athletic, and lovable dogs that are great with kids and other pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2></h2><p>Goldendoodles have been used as pets, agility dogs, guide dogs, therapy dogs, diabetic dogs, and search and rescue dogs. Their lovability, patience, and willingness to please their humans have made them a popular choice for family dogs in recent years.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Lovable Goldendoodle</h3><h2>History of the Goldendoodle</h2><p>Goldendoodles were first bred in 1969 to be guide dogs, but the breed gained popularity among breeders during the 1990s. This ""designer"" mix was bred to combine the non-shedding coat of the poodle with the desirable temperament of the golden retriever.</p><p>The idea for the crossbreed was inspired by the successful breeding of the labradoodle, which is a poodle and Labrador retriever hybrid. As one of the most popular domestic dog breeds in the United States, the golden retriever was an obvious choice for crossbreeding with the delightfully hypoallergenic poodle.</p><p>The first three dogs to earn the American Kennel Club Obedience Champion title after its introduction in 1977 were golden retrievers, which proves their loyalty and ease of trainability poodles were originally bred as retrievers and water dogs, and both the breeds score in the top 5 of the 150 smartest dog breeds. These genes pass on to the goldendoodle, so owners can be assured of an athletic, intelligent and obedient companion.</p><h2>Goldendoodle Care</h2><p>Though low-maintenance, goldendoodles require adequate exercise, grooming, and training. A fenced yard is ideal for goldendoodles to romp around, but they shouldn't be kept there all day. This social breed thrives with its family and friends inside. The fur of a goldendoodle varies, but most of the time, their fur is in between the two extremes when it comes to grooming. In general, the breed isn't difficult to train due to their high intelligence. They respond best to positive, reward-based training and will gladly show off their tricks for a tasty treat.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>With average to above average energy levels, goldendoodles require daily exercise and love to go for walks, runs, hikes, and swims. Their playful nature and retriever genes make them great fetch partners, too. Owners should aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise each day including walking, running, swimming, and tackling agility courses.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Though goldendoodles don't shed excessively, they still need to be brushed regularly which removes dead hair and prevents nasty matting. To keep their skin and coat healthy, they need a moisturizing bath every few months. Depending on the dog, a goldendoodles may grow long hair over its eyes or between its toes and appropriate trimming is required.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Goldendoodles are obedient, athletic, and smart so they take well to training and are eager to please. Agility comes to them naturally and courses are a great place for goldendoodles to burn energy and create a strong bond between owner and companion.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Goldendoodles tends to have excellent health if bred responsibly. They may inherit the health problems associated with poodles and golden retrievers, but it is possible that the hybrid minimizes health problems due to their genetic diversity.</p><p>""Hybrid vigor"" is a common term used when describing mixed breeds, noting the health and vitality of hybrids between two unrelated breeds. Goldendoodles often do exhibit this enhanced health, but only when its parents are purebred golden retrievers and poodles who have been bred responsibly and have no hereditary health issues.</p><p>In your puppy search, it's important to find a reputable breeder who is committed to breeding healthy dogs.</p><p>Hip dysplasia: Poodles and golden retrievers are both prone to hip dysplasia, so a hip exam is highly recommended to keep a potential issue in check.</p><p>Eye disorders: Eye issues are also a common problem among poodles and golden retrievers. Setting up an annual eye exam with your veterinarian is a great idea for all goldendoodle owners.</p><p>Infections: The breed may also be prone to ear infections and yeast infections in the ear if they get wet due to their droopy ears that don't allow water to drain easily. Owners should give their goldendoodle's ears extra attention.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because goldendoodles are active, they need a high-quality diet to keep them happy, strong, and energetic. A dry kibble high in protein and fats does the trick. Dry kibble is helpful in removing plaque and promoting general dental hygiene.</p><p>Corn, wheat, soy, and dairy are common canine food allergies. Goldendoodles are susceptible to food allergies, so it is a good idea to minimize these ingredients in their diet. Go for a grain-free diet with whole vegetables. The food's first ingredient should be meat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Goldendoodle</h2><p>Check with your local animal shelter or rescue group to see if there's a goldendoodle available for your home.

164,https://www.thesprucepets.com/breed-profile-leonberger-1117922,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Working Dog Breeds,<h1>Leonberger (Leo): Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Leonberger (Leo): Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The Leonberger, or Leo, is a thick-coated giant dog with a hard-working spirit and a gentle disposition that hails from the city in Germany after which it was named. Although the breed almost went extinct in World War I, it was saved and thankfully so, as the breed is intelligent, noble, and very loyal. Leonbergers make excellent working dogs but are also calm and affectionate companions. Mature males develop a pronounced lion-like mane, adding to their distinguished appearance, and some say the dog looks bear-like, instead.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Leonberger</h2><p>The Leonberger is an affectionate and gentle dog breed that makes a delightful companion. This breed tends to be very intuitive about human emotions and forms a strong bond with its family. These versatile dogs have a natural instinct to protect and assist people, making them wonderful service dogs and family pets.</p><h2>History of the Leonberger</h2><p>The Leonberger dog breed originates from Leonberg, Germany. During the mid-1800s, a gentleman named Heinrich Essig claimed to have bred a Landseer Newfoundland and a St. Bernard multiple times and later crossed the offspring with a Pyrenean mountain dog. Over the years, it is now believed that other dog breeds were crossed with early Leonbergers; however, no written records remain. The dog's appearance was bred to resemble a lion on the coat-of-arms of Leonberg. The breed became popular in the royal and imperial households of France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and Italy.</p><p>The first Leonberger clubs were established by owners of the breed in 1891. They were popular farm dogs and used to pull carts. They were also used to pull ammunition carts in both World Wars. The breed nearly became extinct during World War I but was saved by a group of enthusiasts.</p><h2>Leonberger Care</h2><p>Leonbergers have a strong drive to work and protect. They need daily exercise to keep them fit and happy. In addition, Leos will benefit from some type of ""job,"" such as guarding the home or obedience competition. In general, these are usually very calm, loyal, and loving companions.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Experts recommend exercising your Leo with two 30 minute walks a day and another 60 minutes of free play. This dog loves to hike, jog, and swim, too. The breed has a superior lung capacity, webbed feet, and a waterproof coat, all designed for swimming.</p><p>Leos tolerate cold weather well, but due to their insulating double coats, they can get overheated in hot weather. It is good to provide a cool place for a Leo in hot weather and to limit exercise to cooler parts of the day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This breed sheds moderately but more so in the spring and fall. Leos need routine grooming, specifically hair-brushing once or twice a week. They typically do not have any need for coat trimming or sculpting.</p><p>In addition to coat care and bathing, a Leo needs regular toothbrushing and nail trimming.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Leos are highly intelligent dogs that respond very well to training. In fact, training and socialization are both essential for this breed. They need basic puppy training and obedience courses when they are under a year old so they know you're the boss. However, this breed is highly sensitive so harsh treatment or yelling while training will only backfire and upset the pup.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the American Kennel Club (AKC). Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It is wise to give Leonbergers breed-specific formulas that meet their needs as a large breed. Leonberger puppies can be fed several times per day and grow to more than 100 pounds by their first birthday. Always provide continuous access to fresh drinking water.</p><p>Adult Leonbergers should be fed twice a day to help prevent bloating and GVD. They should not be given a large meal once a day. You can also minimize the risk of stomach torsion by providing elevated feeding bowls so your dog can eat and drink while standing up. If your dog is prone to gulping its food, look for a feeding bowl that limits the amount of food that can be eaten at one time. You should also avoid vigorous exercise for an hour after a meal.</p><p>Leonbergers have a high potential for weight gain. You can minimize this by setting up a feeding schedule for a specific amount of time, such as 10 to 15 minutes, and then remove any uneaten food, rather than allowing free-feeding.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Leonberger</h2><p>While you might encounter a Leonberger at a local animal shelter, it's more likely that you will find the perfect dog for you from a Leonberger rescue group that's dedicated to rescuing and rehoming unwanted, abandoned, or abused Leonberger and Leonberger mixes. If you choose to work with a breeder, expect to pay anywhere from $1,500 to $4,000 for a purebred Leo puppy.</p><p>Here are a few resources to help you start your search for your own Leo pup.</p><h2>Leonberger Overview</h2><p>An even-tempered dog that's friendly with other animals</p><p>Makes for a good watchdog</p><p>Highly intelligent and responds well to training</p><p>Requires a significant amount of grooming</p><p>Excessive amounts of drooling in some pups</p><p>Susceptible to hip dysplasia</p>",862

English toy spaniels have large, dark, expressive eyes; long, furry ears; and a domed skull. Their coat comes in four varieties, each with a specific name: King Charles (black and tan), Blenheim (red and white), Prince Charles (black, white, and tan), and Ruby (solid red). British royalty favored English toy spaniels not only for their sweet appearance and compact size but also their devotion to their humans and love of being a lapdog. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 14 pounds </p><p>Coat: Medium-length, silky double coat<br/></p><p>Coat Color: Black and tan; black, white, and tan; red; or red and white</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, playful, companionable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the English Toy Spaniel</h2><p>The English toy spaniel tends to have an affectionate and playful personality with its family, though it can be somewhat reserved around strangers. Its temperament also can include a stubborn streak, which might complicate training. But overall this breed is happy, friendly, and relatively quiet.</p><h2>History of the English Toy Spaniel</h2><p>Toy spaniels can trace their history in Great Britain back to the 1500s. The ancestors of these small dogs likely came from Asia and potentially other parts of the world, including Spain.</p><p>British royalty fell in love with toy spaniels, and the dogs are often seen in portraits of royals and aristocrats from centuries past. In fact, around the time of Shakespeare, the dogs were referred to as ""spaniel gentle"" and ""the comforter"" thanks to their loving lapdog nature.</p><p>During the 1800s, crosses between the toy spaniels of Britain and Asian toy breeds, likely the Japanese chin and pug, led to the defined English toy spaniel breed. These dogs had a more domed skull and flatter face than the earlier toy spaniels of Britain. The English toy spaniel's cousin, the Cavalier King Charles spaniel, was actually an attempt to breed a dog that was more like those earlier toy spaniels.</p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the English toy spaniel breed in 1886. But it's still a relatively uncommon breed in the United States today.</p><h2>English Toy Spaniel Care</h2><p>The English toy spaniel has a moderate energy level and loves to play. Its coat does require some upkeep, and it should receive training and socialization starting at a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least an hour per day exercising your dog. As long as this breed gets enough exercise, it's typically calm in the house. A morning and evening walk plus playtime throughout the day should suffice for this little dog. Puzzle toys and dog sports also can help to challenge your dog mentally. </p><p>It's important to note that English toy spaniels generally don't do well in hot weather, as their short face can cause breathing problems. So keep outside exercise brief when it's warm.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your English toy spaniel's coat at least twice a week to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. It's ideal to have a soft-bristle brush and a comb to work out any tangles. Plan on a bath roughly every month, and make sure to brush out the coat well afterward. Also, dry your dog's ears well after a bath. And look in them at least weekly for wax buildup, dirt, and irritation. </p><p>Moreover, check your dog's nails monthly to see whether they're due for a trim. And aim to brush its teeth every day using a canine toothpaste.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your English toy spaniel ideally when it's a puppy to instill good behaviors and prevent bad habits from forming. A puppy class can teach both basic obedience commands and manners. Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. This breed can be especially sensitive to harsh corrections and might shut down and refuse to learn. </p><p>An area of training that you might have to work extra on is teaching your dog to be OK when you leave the house. English toy spaniels prefer to be with their humans and might experience separation anxiety when left alone potentially engaging in destructive behaviors, such as unwanted chewing. A professional dog trainer or behaviorist can give you tips on how to combat this. But this breed is best for a household where someone is home for most of the day.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The English toy spaniel is overall a healthy dog breed. But it is prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure your English toy spaniel has access to fresh water. And feed it a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet, typically in two measured meals per day. A diet that's specifically made for small/toy breeds often is ideal. But be sure to discuss both the type of food and the amount with your vet to verify that you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Also, be mindful of treats and other extra food. Even being just a pound overweight can be a lot for a small dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an English Toy Spaniel</h2><p>The English toy spaniel is a fairly uncommon breed, especially when compared to the popular Cavalier King Charles spaniel. So you might have trouble locating a dog. But it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups for an English toy spaniel in need of a home. See whether you can get your name on a breed wait list. Breeders also might be difficult to come by, depending on where you live. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $1,800 on average.</p><p>For more information to help you find an English toy spaniel, check out: </p><h2>English Toy Spaniel Overview</h2><p>Typically a cuddly lapdog</p><p>Affectionate and playful</p><p>Relatively quiet</p><p>Often doesn't do well when left alone </p><p>Intolerant to hot weather</p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p>",974

The Icelandic sheepdog makes for an affectionate, devoted, and playful companion. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 16.5 inches (female), 18 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 25 pounds (female), 30 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Medium-length double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black and white; cream and white; fawn and white; gold and white; gray and white; red and white; sable and white; tan and white; white, tan, and black; or chocolate and white with a variety of markings and sometimes a black mask</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, playful, energetic</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Iceland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Icelandic Sheepdog</h2><p>Icelandic sheepdogs generally have a friendly and loving temperament. They tend to be quite loyal to their family and can even get along with kids and other pets. High energy, high intelligence, and an eagerness to please also help to shape this breed's personality. </p><h2>History of the Icelandic Sheepdog </h2><p>The Icelandic sheepdog is considered Iceland's only native dog breed. This rare canine is also one of the world's oldest dog breeds. It's believed that the Vikings brought their spitz-type dogs to Iceland more than 1,000 years ago, which became the predecessors for the Icelandic sheepdog.</p><p>Over the centuries, these dogs evolved and adapted to the harsh terrain and the needs of Icelandic farmers and shepherds. They were used to herd sheep and protect the flocks. They also served as loving and loyal companions. </p><p>The breed's numbers dwindled in the 1800s and 1900s, and it almost became extinct. But breed enthusiasts located the remaining dogs and worked to save the breed. And while it is still uncommon today, it's not in imminent danger of extinction. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 2010.</p><h2>Icelandic Sheepdog Care</h2><p>Icelandic sheepdogs need plenty of exercise each day, along with mental stimulation. Their grooming needs are relatively straightforward. They typically take well to training, which should begin ideally when they are puppies.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan on a couple hours per day of physical activity and mental stimulation for an Icelandic sheepdog. These dogs typically love long walks, jogging, hiking, and other outdoor activities. They also can excel in dog sports, such as agility and herding, which will help to burn mental and physical energy. Puzzle toys also are helpful to challenge their minds. Without proper exercise, an Icelandic sheepdog might become bored, stressed, excessively vocal, or even destructive. </p><p>Furthermore, it's important to keep your dog on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. This breed's herding instinct can cause it to run off chasing moving objects, including cars and small animals. Work on a solid recall command, too, in case your dog ever gets loose. Moreover, these dogs are people-oriented. They don't like being left alone for long stretches and prefer to be active with their humans.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush this dog's thick double coat at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Expect periods of fairly high shedding often in the spring and fall, as the dog loses its undercoat. During those times, you might have to brush daily to keep up with all the loose fur.</p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Check its nails monthly to see whether they're due for a trim. Also, be sure to look in your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and signs of infection. Brush its teeth as often as possible, ideally every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socialization from an early age to promote good manners and prevent bad habits from forming. A puppy obedience class not only can help to teach your dog basic commands but also how to behave around other people and dogs.</p><p>Always use positive training methods, as Icelandic sheepdogs don't respond well to harsh corrections. They generally want to please their humans. Thanks to the dog's high intelligence, it should pick up on what you want quickly and as long as you are consistent in your training. As this tends to be a vocal breed, you might have to put extra effort into teaching your dog a ""quiet"" command to stop it from barking excessively.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Icelandic sheepdog overall is a healthy dog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide fresh water for your dog. Feed a nutritionally balanced, quality canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure proper nutrition. But you should always discuss both the type of food and the amount with your veterinarian. Some dogs need specialized diets based on their age, activity level, and other factors. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Icelandic Sheepdog</h2><p>It's not common to find an Icelandic sheepdog at an animal shelter or rescue group, but it's not impossible either. See whether you can get your name on a breed wait list for a dog in need of a home. Breeders also can be difficult to come by, depending on where you live. Expect to pay around $1,000 to $1,500 for a puppy from a reputable breeder, though this can vary widely based on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Icelandic Sheepdog Overview</h2><p>Friendly and playful</p><p>Can be good with kids and other pets</p><p>Intelligent, quick learner</p><p>Can be an excessive barker</p><p>Needs lots of exercise and mental stimulation</p><p>Goes through periods of high shedding</p>",913

These agile dogs are similar in appearance to the Greyhound (hence the breed's nicknames, Berber Greyhounds or Arabian Greyhounds). Sloughis are notoriously affectionate toward their human family members and nobody else, which is why this breed has gained a bit of a reputation for being aloof. For the right people, the Sloughi has plenty of love waiting inside its sleek exterior.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 26 to 29 inches (males); 24 to 27 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 49 to 62 pounds (males); 40 to 51 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Smooth and fine</p><p>Coat Color: Fawn, Black, Sandy, Brindle</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Independent, attentive, sensitive, intelligent, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: North Africa</p><h2>Characteristics of the Sloughi</h2><p>Similar to the Greyhound, the Sloughi is an athletic dog that tends to stay calm when it's not on the move. This breed's temperament is typically reserved, preferring to err on the side of independence rather than being involved in every facet of household life. That's not to say, however, that your Sloughi won't enthusiastically spend time with your family these dogs are loyal to their owners and especially love being around children. Sloughis are known for their gentle personalities and somewhat distant nature towards strangers, so it's best to socialize this breed early on.</p><h2>History of the Sloughi</h2><p>The Sloughi is native to North Africa. A relatively new addition to the American breed scene, these dogs were first recognized by the AKC in 2016. Their history dates back many centuries; so far back, in fact, that the exact time of their origin is uncertain.</p><p>What is known is that the breed was one of two prized sighthound breeds of the Berbers, an indigenous population of Africa. Recorded reports of sighthounds in the region date as far back as the 8th-7th millennium B.C., and it is also well-documented that sighthounds were celebrated among the ancient Egyptians.</p><p>The Sloughi's longstanding popularity in its native region is thanks to the breed's ability to hunt wild pigs, foxes, and hares in harsh North African conditions. The breed is highly athletic, swift, and sly when needed. Today, Sloughis are found mainly in Morocco, as well as in smaller numbers throughout the rest of North Africa.</p><p>These dogs are still rare in the United States. The first Sloughi to cross the Atlantic a dog named Tagiurie el Sian came with her owners Kaethe and Carl Rodarty in 1973, and the American Sloughi Association (ASLA) was later founded in 1989. </p><h2>Sloughi Care</h2><p>Like other short-haired dogs, Sloughis don't require much grooming other than the basics. They need daily exercise and are usually trainable, and because of their sensitive personalities, it's best to use positive reinforcement methods.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Sloughis are an active breed, but so long as they get adequate exercise, they're more than happy to snuggle up on the couch when they're at home. Long daily walks are recommended. It's even better to take your Sloughi somewhere he or she can run off-leash; these dogs love to zip around on their long legs and show off how fast they are. Since their prey drive is strong, fenced-in areas are a necessity. Dog sports like agility training and lure coursing are another great way to help Sloughis expel their energy both physically and mentally.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming a Sloughi is relatively easy thanks to the breed's smooth, short coat. Gentle brushings and simple baths should suffice. Be sure to keep up with other routine grooming steps like brushing teeth, cleaning ears, and trimming nails.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>As far as training, Sloughis respond well to positive reinforcement, though they do have a stubborn streak that sometimes stands in the way. This shy breed needs a bit of encouragement to come out of its shell, especially when it comes to strangers and other dogs. For this reason, it's strongly encouraged to engage in socialization and training classes early on. This can help your Sloughi learn good behaviors in a social setting and maintain desired traits long-term.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>This breed is generally regarded as healthy, but like most purebred dogs, Sloughis are prone to certain genetic illnesses. By adopting from a responsible breeder, you can increase the chances of your dog living a long, comfortable life.</p><p>Addison's Disease doesn't tend to appear until middle age, so it's possible for a Sloughi with this genetic defect to have puppies before it's detected. Unfortunately, gene marker tests for the breed are not yet available.</p><p>If you're planning to purchase a Sloughi puppy, ask your breeder to provide the medical history of its parents (and grandparents, if possible). Credible breeders avoid breeding dogs that carry genetic illnesses. While it's not possible to prevent every dog from hereditary problems, proper care can be taken to mitigate the risk.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your Sloughi will do best on a high-quality diet with plenty of protein. This breed is not usually prone to becoming overweight or obese, but to prevent any problems, talk with your veterinarian to determine meal portions and an appropriate dog food based on your dog's age, weight, and activity level. Feel free to give your Sloughi healthy treats (remembering that positive reinforcement is encouraged), taking care to limit overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Sloughi</h2><p>Sloughis are still a rare dog breed in the United States, so they can be hard to find. Check with your local shelters and any breed-specific rescues to find dogs in need of forever homes. If you're planning to adopt a puppy from a breeder, research different options first, making sure to work with someone who is reputable and takes excellent care of their dogs.</p><p>Sloughi puppies generally cost between $1,200 and $2,000, but some prices may be as high as $6,000 depending on pedigree and availability in your area. Since this breed is rare, expect to join a waitlist to adopt a puppy.</p><h2>Sloughi Overview</h2><p>Calm and relaxed</p><p>Family and kid-friendly</p><p>Doesn't bark much</p><p>Aloof and stubborn</p><p>Shy around strangers</p><p>High prey drive</p>",991
168,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dog-breed-profile-golden-retriever-1117969,Dogs > Dog Breeds > Sporting Dog Breeds,<h1>Golden Retriever: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1>,"<h1>Golden Retriever: Dog Breed Characteristics & Care</h1><h2>History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2></p><p>The golden retriever is a medium-sized breed boasting a golden coat reflective of its name originating from Scotland. Known for their kind eyes, loyalty, and enthusiasm for life, the golden retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. Though historically bred as hunting dogs in the Scottish Highlands, goldens also make excellent family dogs.</p><p>The dogs usually get along well with children and are incredibly affectionate and intelligent. Golden retrievers make wonderful service dogs and are often very successful as guide, assistance, or search and rescue dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 23 to 24 inches (males); 21.5 to 22.5 inches (females)</p><p>Weight: 65 to 75 pounds (males); 55 to 65 pounds (females)</p><p>Coat: Medium-length double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Light to dark gold</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Trustworthy, intelligent, playful, energetic.</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom, Scotland</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Loyal Golden Retriever</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Golden Retriever</h2><h2>History of the Golden Retriever</h2><p>Golden retrievers originated from the Scottish Highlands, where they were used primarily as hunting dogs. The Scottish estate owners needed a dog that could retrieve birds either in water or on land because their hunting grounds had many ponds and marshes. As guns were improved, retrievers needed to be able to bring back birds from farther distances.</p><p>To develop the ideal retriever, the Baron of Tweedmouth, Dudley Marjoribanks, crossed a Tweed water spaniel with a yellow-colored retriever. The four pups were then used in further breeding with lines including the Irish setter, bloodhound, St. John's water dog, and black retrievers. He kept detailed records throughout the later years of the 19th century, showcasing the goal of developing a dog with a soft mouth for retrieving game but that was also strong and active. The breed gained popularity in England and was recognized by The Kennel Club of England in 1911.</p><p>During the early 20th century, golden retrievers were introduced to North America as both a hunting dog and a companion. The golden retriever was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1925. When the AKC debuted the AKC Obedience Champion title in 1977, the first three dogs to earn the designation were golden retrievers. Presidential golden retrievers include those owned by Gerald R. Ford and Ronald Reagan.</p><h2>Golden Retriever Care</h2><p>Golden retrievers have medium-length hair with a thick undercoat and a water-repellent outer coat. They shed moderately most of the year and heavily in the spring and fall. They should be brushed daily and will probably need a bath about once a month. You can expect to live with plenty of dog hair if you have a golden retriever.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Your dog will need its nails trimmed once or twice a month to keep them from splitting and causing foot problems. You should also help your dog maintain good oral hygiene by brushing its teeth at least a couple of times per week. Because they have droopy ears, they are more likely to have ear infections, so check your dog's ears regularly.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Goldens are active dogs which require daily exercise and thorough training. It is best for a golden retriever to have access to a play yard for romping and to be taken out for a walk a couple of times per day. Golden retrievers get along well with most other dogs and a trip to the free-run dog park is likely to be appreciated.</p><p>Golden retrievers are known to be mouthy, carrying things around in their mouths. Have toys and chew bones available to satisfy this oral fixation.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed likes to be where the action is with the family rather than relegated to the yard, where they can easily get lonely. They are not suited to be watchdogs, as they are friendly with everyone. Socialization is important for dogs and comes pretty naturally to the golden retriever. They should do well in a multi-pet household with other canines and cats.</p><p>Golden retrievers are gentle, patient and enjoy playing with kids, but their size means they can knock over a small child if they are excited. This might scare little kids, especially visiting playmates who are not used to a larger dog. When they learn to play together appropriately, a golden retriever is a good match for families with kids.</p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Golden retriever puppies grow rapidly and should be on a low-calorie puppy diet that will keep them from growing too fast and increasing their risk of bone disorders. An adult golden retriever should be fed two meals a day of up to 1.5 cups of dry dog food per meal. It's best to measure out the food and provide it as meals rather than leaving food out for free-feeding. The amount needed for an individual dog depends on its size, activity level, age, and other factors. You should always provide fresh, clean water.</p><p>Be sure to monitor your dog's weight as obesity will shorten your pet's lifespan and predispose other health conditions. If you notice your dog is gaining weight, discuss this with your veterinarian. Get recommendations for feeding schedules, amount of food, type of food, and exercise to keep your dog healthy.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Golden Retriever</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and rescue groups for golden retrievers in need of homes.</p><h2>Golden Retriever Overview</h2><p>Sweet, lovable, and incredibly good-natured</p><p>Loves to be around its family and is good with kids</p><p>Intelligent and easy to train</p><p>Food-obsessed and can easily gain too much weight</p><p>Needs a significant amount of exercise and training</p><p>Sheds regularly and needs daily brushing</p>",935

This breed is extremely driven, loyal, and well-suited for work or companionship. The Dalmatian is known for its distinct spots, slim carriage, and tail arched upward. It also has a rich history as a firehouse dog and, of course, its acclaim from the Disney cartoon movie.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 19 to 24 inches tall</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 65 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short</p><p>COAT COLOR: White with black or liver spots</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Outgoing, friendly, intelligent, active, energetic, sensitive, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Possibly Dalmatia/Croatia or England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Dalmatian</h2><p>Dalmatians can make excellent companions for the right household. It is most important that everyone in the home understands the Dalmatian's need for activity and training, so active households are ideal. This is an affectionate dog breed that bonds closely with its human companions and can make a lovely playmate for the active individual or family.</p><h2>History of the Dalmatian</h2><p>The Dalmatian's true origins are up for debate, but evidence of similar types of dogs goes back to ancient times. It is likely that the breed did not actually originate in Dalmatia (present-day Croatia), but it is certain that Dalmatians were once used as sentinels in the area. They appear in artwork from the early 1600s.</p><p>The Dalmatian is known for its affinity with horses, which made it the original and prized carriage dog or coach dog in England. They would run alongside carriages to serve as protectors and status symbols. Then they also guarded the stables at night. The breed has also served as a dog of war, guard dog, retriever, ratter, and shepherd. The first Dalmatian club was established in England in 1890. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1888.</p><p>The Dalmatian arrived in the U.S. around the turn of the 20th century and one worked closely with teams of firefighters, starting from the era when horses were still used to pull fire engines. The dogs would run ahead of the horses to clear the paths of people and other animals so the engines could quickly get to the scene of the fire. The breed is often still seen as a firehouse mascot. The company Anheuser-Busch also includes a Dalmatian on breeding farms and in television ads where its teams of Clydesdale horses are featured.</p><p>Dalmatians were made extremely popular by Disney's ""101 Dalmatians"" films and programs. This had an unfortunate side effect of irresponsible breeding and inappropriate adoption. As many people could not handle a high-energy Dalmatian, many were abandoned, and rescue organizations were developed. The fad faded and AKC registrations dropped 90 percent in the 10-year period after 2000.</p><h2>Dalmatian Care</h2><p>Dalmatians are very agile, athletic, and versatile. To keep this dog in good shape (physical and mental), Dalmatians need tons of exercise and plenty of activities. Otherwise, they are prone to weight gain, anxiety, and even behavior problems. This breed may also have a tendency for excessive barking, especially if there is not a proper outlet for the dog's energy.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Be sure you walk a Dalmatian on a leash and have a secure enclosure. When off-leash, they may bolt and be long gone before you can react. This breed needs a minimum of two hours a day of exercise, which includes at least two walks and running time.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Dalmatian has a smooth white coat with distinct black or brown spots. Puppies are born white without spots, which develop later. This breed requires little more than basic grooming but is a relatively high shedder and sheds year-round. Regular brushing will help minimize shedding. The good news is that their short coat seems to be dirt-repellent and will quickly shed any mud or other debris.</p><p>Be sure to clean the Dalmatian's ears regularly to prevent ear infections. In addition, keep the nails neatly trimmed so your Dalmatian can walk around comfortably and safely. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Dalmatian is known for its ready-and-willing attitude and seemingly endless energy. These dogs are quite smart, despite what some may think. Dalmatians are also considered to have exceptionally long memories, which can be helpful when training. The extreme energy level of the Dalmatian makes the breed appear goofy at times. This is why proper training is essential for this dog. The Dalmatian is typically very clever and eager to learn if you are diligent and can keep its attention.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A Dalmatian will need two meals per day for a total of 1.5 to 2 cups of dry food. You may need to get a special dog food that is low in purines to reduce the risk of kidney stones. If you notice your dog is gaining weight, discuss the proper feeding schedule, food amount, type of food, and exercise with your veterinarian.</p><p>Be sure to provide constant access to water to reduce the risk of stones. It is good to note whether your dog is urinating regularly.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Dalmation</h2><p>Do you think this high-energy dog is the breed for you? If you would like to get your own Dalmatian, take the time to do your research first. Talk to your veterinarian, other Dalmatian owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more. You might be able to find a rescue or a Dalmatian in a shelter. If you buy from a quality breeder, expect to pay between $600 to $1,200 for a puppy.</p><h2>Dalmatian Overview</h2><p>Great for farms, horses, and as a companion</p><p>Quite intelligent</p><p>Dirt-repellent coat</p><p>High energy and requires plenty of exercise</p><p>Prone to urinary infections and deafness</p><p>Sheds a lot and likes to bark</p>",952

Their existence dates all the way back to the Russian aristocracy and they've continued to be considered a rare breed, especially in the United States.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 8 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: Up to 6.5 pounds</p><p>Coat: Smooth and short</p><p>Coat Color: Black and tan, brown and tan, blue and tan, or red with or without black or brown</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, bold, lively, companionable, protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Russia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Russian Toy</h2><p>For what Russian toy dogs lack in size, they more than make up for in personality. These feisty little pups are energetic, playful, and known for their larger than life temperament. Their favorite place is holding court on their owner's lap, and they are faithful companions that will never be far behind you whether you're on a walk or making dinner in the kitchen.</p><h2>History of the Russian Toy</h2><p>Russian toy dogs are bred from the English toy terrier, a tiny dog breed that members of the Russian aristocracy raised as companions. During the Russian revolution, the breed was transformed and almost eliminated. The resulting dogs looked entirely different than their English toy terrier predecessors, so they were renamed Russian toys.</p><p>Russian Toy dogs were originally all short-haired, but in the mid-1900s, a long-haired dog was also bred. This new variety not only has a longer coat, but also boasts fringe on its ears, tail, and the backs of its legs.</p><p>This breed wasn't really known outside of Russia until the 1990s, when it started making its way to other countries, including the United States. Since then, Russian toys have become increasingly popular in the United States, thanks to their close resemblance to the Chihuahua and their fun personality. The American Kennel Club and United Kennel Club both recognized this breed officially in 2008.</p><h2>Russian Toy Care</h2><p>Russian toys are a relatively low-maintenance breed, thanks in part to their petite size. Still, providing them with proper care including diet and exercise is of utmost importance in order for them to live a healthy and happy life.<br/></p><h3>Excercise</h3><p>Russian toy dogs are a high-energy breed, so plan to provide your pup with plenty of exercise and entertainment. Since these dogs are so small, you won't have to hike miles to tire them out, so meeting their exercise and mental stimulation needs isn't too challenging you can even play fetch indoors with them! It's tempting to think that a Russian toy might make a good ""purse dog,"" but these dogs are inquisitive and energetic. They'd much rather walk alongside you than ride in a purse.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Both smooth-haired and long-haired versions of this breed are easy to groom, but a long-haired dog will require more frequent grooming. Use a soft brush to brush out the coat daily to maintain the coat's health of a long-haired dog. A short-haired dog can do well with less frequent grooming and may benefit from a rubdown with a soft cloth to remove dirt and debris. Regular grooming is important in helping prevent mats, especially in longhaired dogs.</p><p>You'll also need to bathe your dog regularly. A monthly (or more) bath with a quality dog shampoo and coat conditioner can help to keep their coat in good condition. Regular nail trims and dental cleanings are also important in maintaining a Russian Toy's health. You should gently clean their ears once a week, making sure to take notice if their ears are red, smelly, or leaking in any way, as these can all be signs of a serious infection.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>These dogs are intelligent and thus are relatively easy to train. It's best to start training them when they're young, especially since this breed can get a bit headstrong and stubborn. They respond well to training with help from plenty of treats and positive reinforcement.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Russian toy is a relatively new breed, so there are few common health problems with the breed that have been documented. Because Russian toys are so small, they can be prone to bone fractures from incidents like falling off of a piece of furniture or jumping out of a car. It's important to keep this risk in mind when handling these small dogs and any children in the home also need to be taught safe handling techniques. If larger dogs live in the home, they could also risk the Russian toy's safety, so only supervised interaction is recommended. Beyond that, there are a few common health issues that the Russian toy may encounter.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A Russian toy will need to eat quality dog food. These little dogs can be prone to obesity especially when fed lots of treats so it's important to choose a food and portion size that's appropriate for your individual dog. Feeding Russian toys small, low-calorie treats can also help with weight management, but regular exercise is important, too.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Russian Toy</h2><p>Finding a Russian toy can be a bit of a challenge because of the breed's relative rarity in the United States. You may need to travel quite a distance to a breeder or have a dog shipped to you.</p><p>When buying from a breeder, look for one who is reputable and has a well-established program. A good breeder should be genetically testing their stock to eliminate potential health issues, and they should be willing to give you information and photos of the puppy's parents. A breeder should also be able to help you find a puppy with the temperament and characteristics that will best match your lifestyle. Prices for these puppies range between about $1,000 and $2,000. Make sure to also account for shipping fees if you aren't able to find a breeder locally.</p><h2>Russian Toy Overview</h2><p>Friendly and cuddly</p><p>Easily trained</p><p>Small size is ideal for apartment living</p><p>Can be stubborn</p><p>Rare in the United States</p><p>May need additional dental care</p>",975

They like having a job or activity, and they are highly trainable. </p><h2>History of the Labrador Retriever</h2><p>The predecessors to today's Labrador retriever actually originated in Newfoundland (not Labrador). In the early 1800s, a breed called the St. John's water dog, also known as the lesser Newfoundland, was used on fishing boats. These dogs were known for their prowess in the water, good work ethic, and friendly nature. </p><p>British nobles visiting Newfoundland took interest in the dogs. They brought some back to England to serve as gun dogs in retrieving waterfowl during hunts. They also continued to refine the breed in England as it was dying out in Newfoundland. And ultimately they came up with the breed standard we know today.</p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the Labrador retriever in 1917. And the Lab has consistently ranked as one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. in recent years. Many prominent figures throughout history have had Labradors, including both Prince William and Prince Harry as well as President Bill Clinton. Labs also have played important roles in military, police, and service work.</p><h2>Labrador Retriever Care</h2><p>Labs are best suited for homes where they can get plenty of exercise and training. They are high-energy dogs that need lots of attention. Their grooming is fairly simple, though they do shed quite a bit.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Labs can become hyperactive and destructive if they don't get enough daily physical activity and mental stimulation. Plan on at least two hours of exercise each day, such as walks, jogs, hikes, and active playtime. Because these are such people-focused dogs, they'd rather exercise with you than be left in a yard alone.</p><p>Thanks to their background as water dogs, Labs love to swim whenever and wherever they can (even in puddles). So a dog sport like dock diving would be perfect to keep them entertained. Likewise, as retrievers, they love to play fetch. Getting your dog involved in service work, therapy, and other canine jobs also can help to keep it fit and mentally stimulated. <br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Labs have smooth, water-resistant coats that require little more than basic grooming. However, the thick coat does tend to shed a lot, so at least a weekly brushing is important to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Also, Labs tend to shed more heavily in the spring and fall as the weather changes. So you'll likely have to brush multiple times per week to keep up with the loose fur. Fortunately, because their coat naturally stays pretty clean, Labs generally only need a bath every couple of months.</p><p>Plan to trim nails roughly every month, depending on how much your dog wears them down. Also, aim to brush its teeth daily. And check the ears at least weekly for dirt, debris, and any signs of infection. Make sure to dry the ears after swimming and baths.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start socializing and training your Labrador when it's a puppy to help direct its energy and strength in a positive way. Labs are eager to please, and they like having a job even if that job is learning obedience skills. So training is generally easy as long as you are consistent and use positive reinforcement.</p><p>It's ideal to expose a Lab puppy to different people, animals, and situations to help it learn to be a calm and confident dog. Also, enroll in puppy classes as soon as your dog meets the age requirement. </p><p>As true family dogs, Labs usually get along well with children and are known to be incredibly loyal and loving. However, young children should always be supervised around a dog. Labrador retrievers also typically do well in multi-pet households, especially when socialized with other animals from a young age. Always monitor any new additions to ensure all of the pets are behaving appropriately. Obedience instructors can give tips for introducing both children and pets to your Lab.</p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Labs are usually healthy dogs, and responsible breeders should screen for health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available to your dog. Feed your Labrador retriever two meals a day of a quality, nutritionally balanced dog food. Consult your vet on the amount and variety, as this can vary depending on size, activity level, and other factors. Nutrition needs also can change over a dog's life.</p><p>Note that it's common for Labrador retrievers to put on weight and become obese, in part because they love food and will eat past the point of being full. So it's up to you to portion out food and be mindful of treats to prevent overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Labrador Retriever</h2><p>If you have determined that a Labrador retriever is the right fit for your household and that you can commit to the rigorous activity this breed needs, check local animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home.</p><h2>Labrador Retriever Overview</h2><p>Can be trained for a variety of tasks</p><p>Very friendly</p><p>Often good with kids and other pets<br/></p><p>Needs a lot of exercise</p><p>Heavy shedder</p><p>Prone to overeating and weight gain</p>",983

While it developed naturally among ancient Egyptians and along the rivers of Southeast Asia, breeders in the US began their own breeding project 1990s. The Chausie's medium to large, athletic build and grizzled coat resembles its jungle-dwelling ancestors. But, unlike its wild counterparts, its friendly, affectionate demeanor makes the Chausie a great house pet. Because the Chausie is a highly active and playful cat that needs lots of stimulation and company, it is not ideal for owners who are away from the home most of the day. They can live happily with dogs and cats when raised alongside them. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Jungle Curl, Stone Cougar, Mountain Cougar</p><p>Personality: Intelligent, active, social</p><p>Weight: 15 to 25 pounds</p><p>Length: 20 to 22 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short to medium length hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Black, brown, brown ticked tabby, black grizzled ticked tabby</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby, solid, ticked, grizzled</p><p>Eye Color: Yellow, green, gold</p><p>Lifespan: 10 to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Egypt</p><h2>Chausie Characteristics</h2><p>The Chausie cat has an amiable, playful, intelligent personality. It is even-tempered and well-suited for a family with children or other pets. The Chausie usually stops growing at two or three years old and can reach up to 22 inches in length. Like any non-hypoallergenic cat, the Chausie sheds, but usually at a medium to a low level.</p><h2>History of the Chausie Cat</h2><p>The Chausie breed is a hybrid of domestic and jungle cats. These hybrids are thought to have existed for thousands of years, originating in ancient Egypt. The Chausie has also historically been found in Southeast Asia and parts of the Middle East. The name ""Chausie"" is derived from the scientific name for a jungle cat, </p><p>Although jungle cat/domestic cat mixes have a long history of naturally occuring, intentional breeding began in the US in the 1990s. Breeders set out to create a domestic cat that looked wild, in part to provide an ethical alternative to owning big cats. The early Chausie breeding program used many different breeds of domestic cats. But, as time passed, breeders discovered that the Abyssinian and the domestic shorthair were the best options for creating the hybrid.</p><p>Eventually, the breeders succeeded in their quest to develop a new breed, which received recognition from the International Cat Association in 1995. In 2013, TICA granted the breed championship status, allowing them to compete in cat shows for titles. <br/></p><h2>Chausie Cat Care</h2><p>The caretaking regiments of Chausie cats are standard to those of most domestic cats. Understanding how best to care for your cat makes it easier to do so and improves its quality of life.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Chausies are extremely active cats. While their curious and athletic nature will help them keep moving on their own, they still need ample facilitated exercise. Provide your Chausie with toys, play structures, and surfaces on which to jump. Chausies are highly intelligent and trainable, so consider training them to walk on a leash.</p><h3>Shedding</h3><p>The Chausie tends to shed minimally but is not hypoallergenic. They are short-haired cats, meaning they shed less than their long-haired counterparts. Still, Chausies, like all cats, require a grooming routine.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Chausie's short, slightly coarse coat is easy to care for. Brushing your Chausie's fur weekly with a soft slicker brush effectively keeps shedding to a minimum. Practice standard cat grooming regiments such as periodic nail clipping. Although Chausies are not particularly water-averse, bathing isn't necessary.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Chausies are thought to have inherited short intestinal tracts from their wildcat relatives. This can cause a lower tolerance to nutrients from various plants and vegetables. If repeatedly exposed, a Chausie can develop inflammatory bowel disease. Chausies are also prone to food allergies. Besides intestinal issues, the Chausie is considered to be a naturally healthy cat. All cats can develop health complications in their lifetime, so make sure to maintain its healthy lifestyle and visit your vet for checkups.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Chausie is medium or large-sized with a lean, athletic build. It has a deep chest with flat flanks, jutting cheekbones, pointed high-set ears, and angular gold-colored eyes. Many of its physical characteristics are reminiscent of its wildcat lineage as well as a particularly large Abyssinian cat. The Chausie's coat varies in color, but typically (and preferably), it is a black or brown solid or tabby. Even solid black Chausies have slight tabby markings in their youth but tend to outgrow the pattern. Some Chausies have a grizzled coat, which is relatively uncommon in domestic cats and can be attributed to their wildcat genetics. Other Chausies have ""ticking"" on their coats, meaning that the tips of the cat's fur are darker than the rest of the strand.</p><p>The Chausie isn't hypoallergenic, although some cat owners with allergies may be less sensitive to its dander due to its short hair.<br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because of a Chausie's shortened intestine and allergen sensitivity, it may require a specialty diet. Commercial cat foods won't always accommodate their sensitive stomach, especially since meat is a crucial ingredient for a Chausie. Some owners choose to make their cat's food from scratch and follow a keto diet. Remember, if making homemade food for your pet, it's essential to consult a veterinarian to ensure the presence of all necessary nutrients. There are high-end, less generic cat food options worth researching as well.</p><h2>Chausie Overview</h2><p>The Chausie makes a great addition to any family, although finding one may be difficult. Chausies are admired for their playful, social nature but, as a result, have trouble being left alone for long periods.</p><p>Easy-care coat</p><p>Intelligent and active</p><p>Friendly with people and pets</p><p>Rare; hard to find </p><p>Needs a lot of attention</p><p>Doesn't do well if left alone</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Chausie Cat</h2><p>Chausies are rare and expensive. It's unlikely that you will find a Chausie cat at a shelter, but some breeders facilitate adoptions when one of the cats in the litter needs to be rehomed. The International Cat Association curates a list of active breeders on its website, and Chausies usually cost between 1000 and 2000 dollars. </p><h2>Types of Chausie</h2><p>While all Chausies have similar physical builds, there is some variation in color and pattern. The TICA breed standard accepts the following;</p>",1021

It is a spitz-type of dog, which means it has the characteristic wedge-shaped head and bushy tail curled up over the back.</p><p>The breed is extremely attached and loving with its family, including children. Although it is generally accepting of strangers, this dog tends to be reserved, preferring to save its affection for its beloved family.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 19 to 24 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 40 to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: The double coat consists of a medium-long, straight, loosely lying outer coat and a thick undercoat. The hair is shorter on the face, ears, and fronts of the legs and longer on the tail, backs of the legs, and neck. </p><p>COAT COLOR: Any color or combination of colors except pure white and piebald.</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Reserved, alert, calm, watchful, even-tempered, intelligent</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Eurasier</h2><p>Eurasiers were bred to be fantastic family pets and they are not working dogs. They thrive when they are in close proximity to their humans although they do not need constant attention. They can watch over the home but are not aggressive or problem barkers.</p><h2>History of the Eurasier</h2><p>The Eurasier was the fruition of one man's dream to develop the ultimate family dog. Julius Wipfel, who lived in Weinheim an der Bergstrasse in Germany, owned two special dogs with different personalities. One, a male black spitz-type dog of mixed origin, was very wolf-like in behavior, intelligent, and independent. When that dog passed away, he acquired a female wolfspitz, called a keeshond in the United States, which was less wolf-like, but much easier to live with. Longing for a perfect blending of both types of dog primitive and independent, but adaptable and social Wipfel set out to create a new breed. </p><p>Wipfel wanted this new breed to be attractive, medium in size, calm, even-tempered, affectionate, and extremely adaptable to family life. He started in the 1960s by crossing the wolfspitz and chow chow, calling it the wolf-chow. Although the wolf-chow was close to what Wipfel set out to achieve, the new breed needed more genetic diversity, so the Samoyed was introduced in the 1970s. </p><p>The introduction of the Samoyed, with its friendly personality, proved to be just what the breed needed to become the perfect family dog. Wipfel and other breeders who collaborated with him had created what they considered the ideal breed.</p><p>The breed name was changed from wolf-chow to Eurasier to indicate the breed's origin from European and Asian breeds. </p><p>Today, the Eurasier is found throughout Europe, though it's rare in the U.S. The United States Eurasier Club, which is the national parent club for the breed, estimated there were only about 150 of these dogs living in the United States as of the year 2000 (the latest figures).</p><p>It is recognized by the United Kennel Club in the Northern Breed Group and is part of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service (a stepping stone toward full recognition). </p><h2>Eurasier Care</h2><p>The Eurasier is active and athletic, but it doesn't have boundless energy and needs only moderate daily exercise. The Eurasier's gorgeous fluffy coat is naturally clean, needs minimal grooming, and sheds little which makes it a better choice for allergy-prone households. Intelligent and easily trained, this dog is good-natured and loyal.  This breed cannot live outside or in the backyard. It does not do well if left alone too much and it needs to live inside with its family.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Although Eurasiers are up for hikes, you can meet the breed's daily exercise requirements with two 30-minute walks a day. Add in off-leash running, and interactive play to your Eurasier's day. They are athletic and enjoy the physical and mental challenge of training for dog sports and activities such as agility, flyball, obedience, and herding.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Eurasier's soft, profuse, moderately long coat sheds very little and is surprisingly easy to maintain with just a thorough brushing out once or twice a week. Eurasiers are naturally very clean and rarely have any doggie odor. Bathe the Eurasier when dirty and trim the nails weekly or every other week. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and irritation. Aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Eurasier is extremely smart and generally wants to please, so it is a highly trainable dog. The Eurasier is also a sensitive breed avoid harsh training methods and try gentle and positive techniques, like clicker training, using lots of treats, and showering your dog with heaps of praise.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Eurasiers are exceedingly healthy and hardy, boasting a long average life span of 14 years. However, like most purebred dogs, Eurasiers are prone to developing certain inherited conditions.</p><p>The appearance of these genetic issues is kept to a minimum with robust testing of adult dogs before breeding them. The United States Eurasier Club requires all breeders in good standing to screen their dogs for issues with patellas, elbows, hips, eyes, and thyroid prior to breeding. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Many Eurasiers are light eaters, and some are downright picky. Though not prone to overeating, it's good practice to feed measured meals twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time (known as free feeding).</p><p>Ask your breeder or veterinarian to recommend a good dog food for your Eurasier, as well as how much to feed.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Eurasier</h2><p>If you have your heart set on a Eurasier puppy, get ready to wait. The United States Eurasier Club publishes a list of breeders on its website, but there are currently less than 10 breeders in the U.S. You'll likely be put on a waiting list for a puppy. Expect to pay on average between $1,000 to $2,500 for a puppy from a breeder.</p><p>Adult Eurasiers sometimes find themselves in need of rehoming. The United States Eurasier Club also operates a rescue program via its website. </p><h2>Eurasier Overview</h2><p>Wonderful family dog</p><p>Clean and calm in the house</p><p>Easy-care, low-shedding coat</p><p>Cannot be left alone for long periods</p><p>Sensitive to upset in the family</p><p>Some are picky eaters</p>",1007

Aside from its striking facial features, the Devon Rex has a thin, wavy coat that comes in a wide range of colors and patterns. The breed was discovered in England in the 1960s and came to the US through a breeding program later that decade. The breed was recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1979 and gained Championship status in 1983.</p><p>The Devon Rex is exceptionally active, sociable, and friendly. Its athletic nature makes it a great playmate and compliments any family configuration.

The cat usually weighs between six and nine pounds and stops growing at around 12 months. While not as vocal as other breeds, these cats make themselves known through their vibrant personality and playful behavior. Devon Rexes love to cuddle up against humans and other pets in their family.<br/></p><h2>History of the Devon Rex</h2><p>The Devon Rex cat was first discovered in the Devonshire region of England in 1960 when a woman, Beryl Cox, stumbled across a novel, curly-coated kitten, which she named Kirlee. Cox initially believed that the kitten was related to the Cornish Rex breed. However, attempts to crossbreed Kirlee with Cornish Rex queens proved otherwise.</p><p>Kirlee was bred to female Cornish Rex cats to try to produce kittens sharing the same coat qualities of the Cornish Rex breed. Unfortunately, the mix only bred kittens with straight coats. Later, it was discovered that an unrelated gene mutation was responsible for the wavy coat, among other uniquely Devon Rex features. Following the realization, Cox developed a more comprehensive breeding program to preserve Kirlee's mutation.</p><p>In 1968, the first Devon Rex cat was imported to the United States, and by 1979, the breed received official recognition from the Cat Fanciers' Association. Today, the Devon Rex is available from reputable breeders throughout the country. The unique-looking breed is said to have inspired director Steven Spielberg's E.T., based on his own Devon Rex.</p><h2>Devon Rex Care</h2><p>Caring for your Devon Rex is relatively straightforward and standard to the care regimens of most domestic cats. Knowing how best to care for your cat is essential to improving its high quality of life.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Devon Rex's outgoing personality has a natural inclination toward exercise. They require ample exercise, which you can conduct through teaching tricks and providing stimulating toys and surfaces on which to climb and jump. Training can strengthen the bond between you and your cat while giving much-needed mental stimulation to this intelligent breed. Devon Rexes are known for seeking out lofty spots during playtime or rest, so create spaces that accommodate your cat's energy needs.<br/></p><h3>Shedding</h3><p>There is no such thing as a fully hypoallergenic cat, but the Devon Rex comes close. Its very short coat sheds, but only minimally. It is considered one of the lowest maintenance shedding breeds, but you can still expect some light shedding.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Devon Rex requires minimal grooming. Since the breed's coat only has sparse, breakable hairs, you won't need to brush frequently. Instead, you can gently wipe your cat's fur with a damp cloth weekly. Excessive grooming by you or your cat can lead to bald patches. You may periodically wash your Devon Rex as well. Keep an eye out for accumulated ear wax. You should regularly clean inside your cat's ears to ensure that wax buildup doesn't cause any issues.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While this breed isn't known for excessive health ailments, there are several conditions should be aware of.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Devon Rex is known for its unique, almost alien appearance. They have large eyes, large noses, high cheekbones, and low-set rounded ears. Sometimes, the ears bear small tufts of fur. Devon Rexes have lean, muscular bodies, long, athletic legs, and large toes. Their short coats and prominent features make the neck and chest appear bony, but this cat is a powerful jumper.</p><p>The Devon Rex's short coat ranges from wavy to velvety. Because the Devon Rex has a fragile coat with little guard hair, it is prone to developing bald spots from excessive grooming. It also has easily-broken whiskers.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Devon Rexes have huge appetites and will go to great lengths to snatch food from the table or counter. Make sure not to let human food become a staple of your Devon Rex's diet, and avoid giving in to the cat's persistent begging. Instead, ensure that you give it quality cat food for effective weight management. Remember only to offer treats in moderation.</p><p>The Devon Rex usually does well on commercial cat food. Because of the energetic breed's high activity level, be sure to form a diet that accommodates accelerated calorie burning. Always consult your veterinarian before creating a diet for your cat.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Devon Rex</h2><p>You're not likely to find a Devon Rex in a standard pet shelter. The best option for adopting a Devon Rex is to visit a shelter that specializes in the breed. However, it will be easier to find a Devon Rex for sale through a breeder. You can expect to pay between $600 and $1000 for a Devon Rex.</p><h2>Devon Rex Overview</h2><p>Devon Rexes make for great additions to any family. Their playful nature, often accompanied by some mischievousness, is perfect for high-energy owners ready to engage with their cats. The Devon Rex's large appetite can get it into trouble but know that it means no harm.

It's known for its athletic, muscular, and energetic body. Highly intelligent and driven, kelpies enjoy working hard. In fact, they really need a job to do hanging around the house simply won't suffice. Most working Australian kelpies herd sheep, though some round up cattle as well.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding (UKC)</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 20 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 30 to 45 pounds</p><p>COAT: Moderately short, straight, and weather-resistant with a brushy tail; may be longer on the neck and the backs of the thighs</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, with or without tan markings; blue (gray) ranging from dark to light, with or without tan markings; red ranging from chocolate to light red, with or without tan markings; or tan ranging from dark to cream</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, eager, energetic, loyal, alert, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Australia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Australian Kelpie</h2><p>Australian kelpies are affectionate with children and typically get along well with other pets, though they might need to be discouraged from excessive herding of other members of their pack. They are highly trainable, eager to please, and loyal. When paired with an owner who understands the breed's special needs, the Australian kelpie can be the ultimate companion. <br/></p><h2>History of the Australian Kelpie</h2><p>Though the name suggests the Australian kelpie was developed in Australia, its ancestors are in fact Scottish. Medium-sized working collies of various types some longhaired and some smooth, some black and tan, and some red were imported into Australia in the late 1800s to help Australian farmers manage their enormous flocks of thousands of sheep in difficult weather and terrain.</p><p>One female considered to be the foundation of the breed was named ""Kelpie,"" which is the name of a shape-shifting aquatic creature in Celtic mythology. When Kelpie was eventually bred, her puppies were impressive sheepherders. The line of dogs came to be called ""Kelpie's pups,"" and later, simply kelpies (without capitalization).</p><p>Although the breed is a well-known working dog in Australia, the Australian kelpie is not as recognized in the United States since they are rarely kept as pets. However, a few thousand kelpies can be found working on ranches and farms in North America.</p><p>The Australian kelpie is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, but it's part of the AKC Foundation Stock Service, which is the first step toward the breed's eventual full recognition. The Australian kelpie is fully recognized by the United Kennel Club, where it is part of the Herding Dog Group. The breed is also recognized by the international kennel club Fédération Cynologique International (Group 1: Sheepdogs and Cattle Dogs).</p><h2>Australian Kelpie Care</h2><p>Australian kelpies are bred to work all day in difficult conditions so they need an extreme amount of exercise. You'll need basic grooming skills for this breed, which is helpful because you won't have time for that since you'll be out exercising your kelpie.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>If an Australian kelpie is primarily a pet, be prepared to offer hours of daily exercise and mental engagement, whether in the form of jogging, hiking, retrieving games, trick training, herding, agility, swimming, disc dog events, or almost any other competitive canine sport. The breed has impressive endurance; if you're looking for a running partner, the Australian kelpie is your dog. A kelpie isn't meant to be on a leash at all times. Provide free running opportunities in a safe area away from traffic.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Australian kelpie's weather-resistant short coat is wash-and-wear. Brush weekly or more often if you want to reduce shedding (the coat, although short, sheds a fair amount). Bathe the Australian kelpie when it becomes dirty.</p><p>Check the nails every other week, trimming them when necessary. Working dogs may naturally wear their nails down outside and require less frequent nail trims. Peek in the ears monthly to check and clean for debris or redness. Clean the ears with a pet ear cleaner and cotton balls when they become dirty. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like most herding breeds, Australian kelpies are extremely smart and compliant. In fact, the breed's intelligence rivals that of the famed border collie. Kelpies can be trained to do just about anything, and they are eager to learn new skills.</p><p>Training is an excellent way to put a kelpie's powerful brain to work, and can go a long way toward fending off boredom. Positive-reinforcement methods like clicker training give great results with a kelpie. </p><p>Australian kelpie puppies need lots of socialization early on in life to ensure they will be accepting of friendly strangers and comfortable in an urban environment. The breed may bark excessively, especially if not trained to cease once the alarm has been appropriately sounded.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Australian kelpies are in general a very healthy and hardy breed. However, as with all breeds, certain genetic issues have been identified in the Australian kelpie.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Australian kelpies, especially working Australian kelpies, need to eat an energy-dense, high-quality food to fuel their active bodies. If you're not sure what to feed your kelpie, or how much to feed, ask your veterinarian or breeder to advise you. Although kelpies get so much exercise that they are unlikely to become overweight, older kelpies or those recovering from an injury might need a lower-calorie diet to avoid weight gain. Too much weight contributes to joint disorders like arthritis, elbow dysplasia, and hip dysplasia, and can lead to other health issues like diabetes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Australian Kelpie</h2><p>The Australian kelpie is not a good choice for the average pet owner, but if you're looking for a performance dog or working dog, the breed may be a great fit. Though Australian kelpies are mostly similar, different breeders specialize in different types of working ability.

The breed is known for its incredibly sensitive scent skills and a sweet, easy-going personality that makes it a great choice for families.</p><p>This breed of family dog also continues to be selectively bred for both color as well as its hunting abilities, particularly for both raccoon and possum. However, the black and tan has also proven proficient in hunting larger animals, such as deer, bears, and even mountain lions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 23 to 27 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 65 to 110 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short and dense</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black with tan accents</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Gentle, lovable, trusting, adaptable, easy-going, even-tempered</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><p><br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Black and Tan Coonhound</h2><p>Black and tans are sturdy, strong, and athletic, and will fit right in with an active family lifestyle. On the other hand, they can also be couch potatoes and love nothing more than a long snooze on the sofa.</p><h2>History of the Black and Tan Coonhound</h2><p>The first coonhound breed registered by the AKC (1945), the black and tan coonhound was born when frontiersmen first crossed European hound dogs including foxhounds and bloodhounds to create a unique American breed. The black and tan is considered an older breed, as it is also believed to have descended from the Talbot hound, which was well-known in England in the 11th century.</p><p>These all-American dogs eventually became known as coonhounds, and they were tasked with the responsibility of hunting game primarily raccoons at the time, which provided an ongoing source of meat, fat, and fur for the settlers who set out for the western and southern territories in post-Revolutionary America.</p><p>At the time, there was simply not a breed that was properly equipped to hunt the nocturnal creatures. Though foxhounds were being used in traditional English-style fox hunts, these dogs were bred to run across the flatlands of a Southern plantation and weren't quite up to the task of chasing raccoons through the woods or murky swamps at night.</p><p>The new coonhound breed proved to be up to the challenge, as they could trail the raccoon scent regardless of the terrain, and then call out to the hunters in their almost musical howling voice to mark their location. They weren't necessarily the fastest dog, but they could trail their prey as sharply as a bloodhound and then ""bark up"" when they located their quarry. One of the earliest coonhound enthusiasts was legendary explorer and huntsman Daniel Boone and his home state of Kentucky ultimately became a hub for coonhound breeding.</p><h2>Black and Tan Coonhound Care</h2><p>A black and tan coonhound will require a moderate amount of daily exercise, which could include playing outside in the yard or taking a long, brisk walk. Thanks to its breeding, beware out in public that this breed will find any small animal irresistible. The coonhound's powerful noses make this dog ideal for anyone who enjoys hunting as a hobby, as it can be trained to hunt just about any kind of game.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This calm and relaxed dog only needs between 30 to 60 minutes of exercise a day. But when walking, remember this dog has a strong prey drive, so it should always be securely walked on a strong leash, and a tall, sturdy fence is a must-have for any black and tan coonhound owner. Your coonhound is bred to seek out scents, so let it use its nose to sniff around when walking.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Thanks to their short, dense coat that sheds once or twice a year, the black and tan coonhound will require weekly brushing with tools such as a brush or rubber grooming mitt to help remove the dead hair before it ends up all over your home. Regular grooming will also help keep their coat and skin healthy.</p><p>Black and tans have other basic grooming needs, as well. They should be bathed occasionally and nails trimmed regularly, as long nails can create discomfort for these active dogs. As with all breeds, their teeth should be brushed regularly with canine toothpaste at least twice a week. This breed's ears can also be prone to infections, so they should be cleaned and checked regularly.</p><h3>Training</h3><p><br/>Though they are intelligent and devoted to their families, the black and tan coonhound is also considered to be an independent breed so training can sometimes be a challenge. These are not dogs that will blindly obey their owners at all costs, though they can certainly be trained.</p><p>Early socialization and puppy training classes are recommended for this breed, as once they've learned something, they'll be inclined to continue doing it that way. Consistent training right from the start is an absolute must.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The black and tan coonhound should perform well with a high-quality commercial or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times. As with all breeds, treats should be given in moderation and their diet should be controlled to avoid weight gain or obesity-related issues.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Black and Tan Coonhound</h2><p>Be sure to do your homework when choosing a dog breed. Talk to other black and tan coonhound owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more about this particular breed and its care. Consider rehoming a black and tan. Check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for dogs of this breed in need of a forever home. Depending on the breeder, expect to pay between $600 to $1,600 for a black and tan coonhound puppy.</p><h2>Black and Tan Coonhound Overview</h2><p>Affectionate</p><p>Easy-going</p><p>Intelligent</p><p>Independent and difficult to train</p><p>Doesn't like to be alone</p><p>Strong prey drive</p>",935

Discovered in the UK in the 1940s, the short-legged lineage was perpetuated by breeding, but it wasn't until 2003 that munchkins were accepted as an official breed by The International Cat Association (they are not yet accepted by the Cat Fanciers' Association).</p><p>Despite their controversial breed status, munchkin cats make loving pets that delight their owners with humorous antics like scurrying after toys in a ""ferret-like"" fashion and sitting upright like rabbits.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Friendly, sociable, playful, and energetic</p><p>Weight: Up to 9 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches long</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair, medium hair, and long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Any color of the feline rainbow</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, tabby, calico, tortoiseshell, or bicolor</p><p>Eye Color: All colors, including blue, brown, copper, green, and yellow</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom</p><h2>Munchkin Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Munchkins are sometimes compared to ferrets in the way that they run and play on their short legs, but they are bona fide felines. Because munchkins may be bred to a wide variety of domestic cats, an individual cat's personality will depend on its inheritance. All-in-all, munchkins have been described as loving, sociable, and playful by their devoted fans.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Unique and Adorable Munchkin Cat</h3><h2>History of the Munchkin Cat</h2><p>Munchkins owe their short legs to a naturally occurring gene, not human selective breeding. In the 1940s, a veterinarian in the United Kingdom described several generations of short-legged cats a line that disappeared during World War II. However, a similar short-legged cat was discovered in Stalingrad in 1953.</p><p>Thirty years later, US cat breeder Sandra Hochenedel found a short-legged cat in Louisiana she named Blackberry. Blackberry's first and subsequent litters consisted of half short-legged kittens from which today's munchkin breed has descended. The munchkin achieved The International Cat Association championship status in 2003.</p><p>The gene that produces the short legs of munchkin cats is autosomal dominant, meaning it is not sex-linked and is expressed whether inherited from one parent or both parents. However, it is lethal when copies are inherited from both parents (those embryos die in the womb). As a result, munchkins are only bred with regular domestic cats, not with other munchkins.</p><p>The offspring of munchkin/domestic cat matings have an equal chance of being munchkins or not. Only the offspring that are munchkins carry the gene.</p><p>The breed standard states that permissible outcrosses are domestic longhair or shorthair cats that are not members of a recognized breed. Munchkin crosses with recognized breeds produce short-legged variations of that breed.</p><p>There is an ongoing debate about whether recognizing the munchkin as a breed is ethical due to its abnormal mutation. Opponents say they should not promote a genetic mutation that could have poor health consequences for the cat.</p><p>Proponents point to evidence that munchkins do not seem to have any health concerns specific to the breed, and the cats seem to lead a full life on their shorter legs.</p><h2>Munchkin Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The munchkin requires a little grooming assistance since its shorter legs prevent it from reaching certain areas of its coat with its tongue. Shorthaired cats should be brushed weekly and long-haired cats should be brushed a couple of times per week. Regular brushing helps prevent hairballs and matting.</p><p>You should also trim your cat's nails, help your cat maintain oral hygiene by brushing its teeth a couple of times per week, and get regular cleanings at the veterinarian.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Munchkins have no problem running around on their shorter legs but can't jump as high as their longer-legged counterparts. Still, they will hop and climb, so providing a cat tree can help them reach new heights safely. These curious and active cats enjoy interactive cat toys and playtime with their people.<br/></p><p>Munchkins have personalities that run the gamut of domestic cats. They generally get along well with children, other cats, and dogs. Any cat should be kept as an indoor-only cat to ensure it is not exposed to diseases from other cats and fights, attacks, or accidents. Spaying or neutering your cat is recommended if they are not going to be bred.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The gene responsible for the munchkin's short legs has been likened to the gene that gives dachshunds and Welsh corgis their diminutive statures. However, since the spine of a cat is physically different from that of a dog, munchkins do not suffer the spinal problems that are sometimes associated with those canine breeds.</p><p>Studies of older munchkins have not found any conditions that stem from their short-legged stature or possible structural problems. You can expect a normal lifespan if you get the recommended immunizations and preventative care from your veterinarian.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The munchkin is a medium-sized cat that may appear smaller because of its short legs. Besides its leg length, the munchkin is a very normal-looking cat, bearing characteristics of its particular breeding lineage. Generally speaking, the munchkin's coat is soft and plush, ranging in length from short to long.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your munchkin cat should be fed the same diet as any other cat. A munchkin is a medium-sized cat with a weight and body mass that is not significantly affected by having short legs. A wet food diet is often considered best, but you can leave out dry food for your cat to snack on as well. Discuss your cat's needs with your veterinarian, especially if your cat has diabetes, is obese, or is older. Provide fresh, clean water for your cat at all times.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Munchkin Cat</h2><p>You may be able to purchase a purebred munchkin cat through a breeder in your area. There is a website called Munchkin Cat Guide that maintains a breeder directory.</p><h2>Munchkin Cat Overview</h2><p>Munchkin cats are cute, short-legged felines that look and act like the breed(s) in their family history. There is a controversy involving the ethics of breeding cats with abnormally short legs, but the breed appears to be healthy and free of skeletal issues such as those that affect the Scottish fold. If you have no qualms about perpetuating the anatomical abnormality of the munchkin breed, then you will enjoy the playful and friendly companionship of this unique cat.</p><p>Loving, sociable, and playful</p><p>Not likely to jump up to high places</p><p>Not susceptible to any breed-specific illness</p><p>Breeding this cat is controversial</p><p>Needs help with grooming</p><p>Less agile than other cats; may be prone to injury if left on high surfaces like counter tops</p>",1067

It is all-white with colored markings on the face and tail only. This type of color pattern is so distinctive that when it appears in other cat breeds it is often called a ""van"" pattern.</p><p>These active and athletic felines love to climb, jump and explore. Although they might curl up with you for the occasional cuddle, Turkish vans are more likely to be found roaming the house and following you from room to room, looking for adventure.</p><p>One unique characteristic of the Turkish van cat is its love of water. The Turkish van is often called the ""swimming cat.""</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, energetic, adventurous, and playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 20 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 30 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Medium-length hair</p><p>Coat Colors: White with colored markings on the head and tail (red, black, blue, tabby, tortoiseshell, or any other color other than Himalayan pattern and colors)</p><p>Coat Patterns: Bicolor</p><p>Eye Color: Amber, blue, or odd-eyed (each eye a different color)</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 17 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Middle East</p><h2>Turkish Van Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Turkish van cats have friendly, outgoing, and affectionate personalities, especially with their beloved human family members. Because of their even-keeled temperament, they tend to get along well with other cats, dogs, and respectful kids.</p><p>These large, mostly white cats are not fully grown until they are three to five years old. They are born with their ""van"" coloration, appearing on their ears/head and tail, and their coats are silky and medium length.</p><h2>History of the Turkish Van Cat</h2><p>The Turkish van is an ancient breed that's rare even in its native place of origin. It developed naturally in the region of central and southwest Asia (the present-day countries of Iran, Iraq, and parts of the Soviet Union and Turkey). The breed name comes from the name of a lake and a city in the region, both called Van, and the original cats were simply called ""vancats."" </p><p>The first Turkish van to leave the region arrived in England in 1955. At first, the breed was referred to simply as the Turkish cat, but due to confusion between the Turkish van and the Turkish angora, the breed name Turkish van was eventually adopted.</p><p>The Turkish van was finally introduced in the United States in 1982. The breed is recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association and The International Cat Association.</p><h2>Turkish Van Cat Care</h2><p>The Turkish van experiences a seasonal heavy shed to reveal its summer coat, which is much shorter to help the cat stay cool in the warm months. You might need to brush your Turkish van more during this shedding period, but throughout the rest of the year, weekly brushing is all that's needed to keep the coat looking sleek and feeling soft. Thanks to its unique texture, the Turkish van's coat naturally resists matting.</p><p>Turkish van cats love to play, climb and explore. Provide lots of climbing and perching opportunities, and invest in some fun interactive toys like feather wands and puzzle toys. Many Turkish van cats like to retrieve tossed toys like small balls and toy mice.</p><p>Unlike many cats, Turkish vans actually like playing and splashing in water, so consider offering some supervised water play opportunities in the sink or bathtub. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Turkish van is a large cat. The breed is slow to mature, taking an average of three to five years to finish growing and reach their adult weight of up to 20 pounds. In general, the breed is quite healthy and long-lived.<br/></p><p>Solid white vans are prone to deafness and are referred to as Turkish vankedisi. They are not considered show quality, and reputable breeders avoid breeding them.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The texture of the Turkish van's semi-long, soft coat has been likened to cashmere. Because the breed developed in a region that experiences temperature extremes, the Turkish van's coat changes according to the season.</p><p>To keep the cat warm in cold weather, the winter coat is longer and thicker, with tufts of hair often sprouting between the toes. The winter coat also exhibits feathering on the ears, legs, feet, and belly, but the hair on the face remains short. Mature Turkish vans also have a full neck ruff and brush tail.</p><p>Although the Turkish van and Turkish angora look similar, they are distinct breeds that developed independently of one another. The Turkish angora is smaller and finer-boned than the Turkish van and comes in more colors and patterns. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because the Turkish van is already a large cat, it's especially important not to overfeed. Staying lean is key to preventing health issues. Leaving food out all day (free feeding) can sometimes be tolerated without weight gain because of this breed's high activity level. Consult with your veterinarian or breeder regarding the best food to feed your Turkish van cat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Turkish Van Cat</h2><p>If you're thinking about buying a Turkish van kitten, a great place to meet local breeders is a cat show. Cat shows are a fun place to see many different cat breeds all in one place. </p><p>Some Turkish van cats or Turkish van mix cats, often adults, might end up in rescue. Check with local cat-specific rescue groups or even local shelters. Or you might find a rescue cat of unknown heritage that looks and acts just like a Turkish van.</p><p>Note that breeders generally keep kittens with the mother until 12 to 16 weeks of age, at which time they are ready to go home to their new families. </p><h2>Turkish Van Cat Overview</h2><p>The Turkish van is an excellent cat for active families that enjoy interacting with their pets. This large, silken-haired feline is generally ready for fun and even enjoys swimming or playing in water. While it isn't likely to cuddle up in your lap for long, the van is an affectionate companion who doesn't mind being petted and picked up on occasion. The van's medium-length hair requires minimal brushing except during the spring shed, and this generally healthy cat is not predisposed to any major health issues.</p><p>Affectionate and friendly </p><p>Playful and engaging</p><p>Gets along well with other pets</p><p>Generally not a lap cat</p><p>Moderate shedding</p><p>Doesn't do well if left alone for long periods of time</p>",1025

Its erect ears are notably large and taper from a broad base to a slightly rounded tip. And its tail has a slight curve at the end. Overall, the breed is sturdy and muscular but not overly bulky. This allows it to move with agility and endurance in fields herding livestock. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 21.5 to 23.5 inches (female), 23.5 to 25.5 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, wiry double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Brindle or fawn with/without white markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Energetic, alert, intelligent</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Berger Picard</h2><p>The Berger Picard generally has a bright and energetic temperament. This dog does best in an active household that will provide it with plenty of exercise and mental stimulation. High intelligence and trainability also shape the breed's personality, though it can be stubborn about following commands at times. </p><h2>History of the Berger Picard</h2><p>The Berger Picard (pronounced: bare ZHAY pee CARR) is an ancient breed, and its origin is murky. Its ancestors are thought to have existed in France since the Middle Ages. And it might be a descendant of dogs brought to France by Central European Celts. It's also a close relative of other French herding dogs, including the Briard and Beauceron, though it's thought to be the oldest of these herders. </p><p>These dogs call the agricultural Picardy region of France home, where they were valued for their stamina and determination when herding. They were entered in France's first dog show in 1863 in the same class as the Briard and Beauceron. It wasn't until 1925 that the Berger Picard was recognized as a distinct breed in France.</p><p>World War I and II caused the breed's numbers to dwindle, and it almost went extinct. Breeders have kept it alive, though it's still rare. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Berger Picard in 2015. And the breed even got a popularity boost as the star of the 2005 movie ""Because of Winn-Dixie.""</p><h2>Berger Picard Care</h2><p>Plan to spend ample time exercising your Berger Picard. Fortunately, this breed has fairly low-maintenance grooming needs. But it should receive consistent training and socialization starting from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least two hours of exercise per day for your Berger Picard. Ideal activities include long walks, games of fetch, running, cycling, swimming, and hiking. Dog sports, including herding and agility, also are great ways to provide mental and physical challenges. And puzzle toys can give your dog some mental stimulation.</p><p>A bored Berger Picard that doesn't have an outlet for its energy might become destructive, so make sure you're able to dedicate enough time each day to exercise your dog.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Berger Picard has a soft, insulating undercoat paired with a waterproof, wiry outer coat. It doesn't need trimming, as this can damage the coat's texture. And you typically only have to brush a few times a month to remove any loose fur and dirt. The coat is not prone to matting. However, expect periods of higher shedding often in the spring and fall, during which you should brush at least a few times per week to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>The coat also stays relatively clean on its own, so in general you'll only need to bathe your dog when it gets dirty. But check your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup, dirt, and other abnormalities. Plus, trim its nails roughly once a month, and aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Berger Picards are smart and can pick up on training commands relatively quickly. Start training and socializing ideally when your dog is a puppy to instill good manners and prevent bad habits. </p><p>Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as praise and treats. This breed can be sensitive to harsh corrections, shutting down and refusing to learn. Also, aim to keep your training sessions fun and varied to hold your dog's interest. The breed does have a stubborn streak and can get bored with excessive repetition. </p><p>Furthermore, if not adequately socialized from a young age, some Berger Picards might be skittish around new people and places. So start introducing your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations as early and often as possible. Keep interactions positive using treats and praise, and stop if your dog seems overwhelmed. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Berger Picard is typically a very healthy dog breed throughout its life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Fresh water should always be available for your dog. And feed it a quality, nutritionally balanced diet, typically via two measured meals per day. Run both the type of food and the amount by your vet to ensure that you're meeting your dog's individual needs. For instance, if your Berger Picard lives a very active lifestyle, its nutrition needs might be higher. But be mindful of treats and other extra food to avoid overfeeding.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Berger Picard</h2><p>The Berger Picard is extremely rare, so it might be difficult to find at both rescue groups and breeders. But it's still worth checking animal shelters and rescues to see whether there's a dog in need of a home. Get your name on a breed wait list if possible. For breeders, you might have to wait some time and travel a great distance to find a puppy. Expect to pay around $2,000 to $3,000 on average for a puppy from a responsible breeder.</p><h2>Berger Picard Overview</h2><p>Adventurous and athletic </p><p>Typically a healthy breed</p><p>Easy-care coat</p><p>Needs lots of exercise </p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p><p>Might be destructive when bored</p>",937

Its ears are upright and triangular, and its bushy tail curls over its back. Shibas were bred for hunting and are still quite muscular and athletic. They also have a reputation for being independent and aloof at times. And they tend to groom themselves much like cats do.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 13.5 to 15.5 inches (female), 14.5 to 16.5 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 17 pounds (female), 23 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black and tan, cream, red, red sesame with/without white markings</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, independent, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Japan</p><h2>Characteristics of the Shiba Inu</h2><p>The shiba inu overall tends to have a reserved personality but can be quite affectionate and attentive with its owner. High intelligence and some stubbornness are generally components of the breed's temperament. The shiba can do well with other dogs and kids, especially when socialized from a young age.</p><h2>History of the Shiba Inu</h2><p>The shiba inu can track its history all the way back to 300 BC in Japan. Hunters used the dog to help them flush out small game. In fact, ""shiba"" means brushwood in Japanese, and ""inu"" means dog potentially referring to the dog's ability to flush animals out of the brush. Another possibility is brushwood was in reference to the reddish color of the shiba's coat.</p><p>During the 1800s, many foreign dog breeds made their way to Japan. By the early 1900s, there were almost no purebred shibas due to mixes with these foreign breeds. Breeders started to work to preserve the breed. But World War II derailed those efforts, and the shiba inu almost became extinct. </p><p>Three bloodlines from different regions persisted, and today's shiba inu is a combination of those. By the mid-1900s, the shiba inu had made its way to the United States. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1992. </p><h2>Shiba Inu Care</h2><p>This breed has a moderate energy level and needs daily exercise and mental stimulation. Regular grooming, as well as consistent training and socialization, are a must for a happy, healthy, well-adjusted dog.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The shiba inu should get at least an hour of exercise per day via walks, hikes, jogging, playtime, and more. Plus, puzzle toys and dog sports are a great way to engage your dog mentally as well as physically. A bored shiba that doesn't receive adequate exercise and mental stimulation might develop problem behaviors, such as excessive chewing.</p><p>When taking your shiba outdoors, always keep it on a leash or in a securely fenced area. This breed specifically has difficulty with recall training and might run off when given the chance especially if it sees a small animal it wants to hunt. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming is relatively straightforward for the shiba inu. Plan to brush weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Expect periods of higher shedding seasonally, during which you'll have to brush more frequently to keep up with all the loose fur. </p><p>The shiba's coat stays fairly clean. Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. And be sure to look in its ears weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Also, check whether your dog's nails are due for a trim around once a month. Aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>When it comes to training a shiba inu, you might need more persistence and patience than the average dog breed. These dogs can be quite strong-willed and stubborn, engaging in training sessions only when they want. Aim to start training from a young age to prevent bad habits from forming. Always use positive reinforcement methods, such as treats and praise, to help keep your dog's attention. </p><p>One aspect of training that often comes easily for a shiba inu is housebreaking. From a young age, these dogs don't like making a mess in their indoor space and thus appreciate being let outside to relieve themselves.</p><p>For socialization, aim to expose your shiba to different people, other dogs, and various locations from a young age. This will help to boost its comfort and quell some of its standoffish nature. Still, many shibas tend to be wary of strangers, though they typically aren't excessive barkers. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The shiba inu has a long lifespan for a dog breed, and it's generally healthy.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your shiba inu. Feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's common to feed two measured meals per day. Make sure to discuss both the quantity and type of food with your vet to verify that you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Some shiba inus can be particular about the type of food they eat, potentially requiring you to try a variety of dog foods. But others will eat anything. Always monitor treats and other extra food to ensure that you're not overfeeding your dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Shiba Inu</h2><p>The shiba inu is a moderately popular dog breed. As such, if you're looking for one, it's worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. Ask to get on breed wait lists if possible.

Although it looks a bit like a wild cat, this breed is gentle, friendly, and completely domesticated. The breed developed naturally on remote islands of Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and was perpetuated by the likes of sailors, soldiers, and cat fanciers in Russia and Europe. Today, these relatively rare cats make delightfully affectionate and easygoing family pets.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, mild-mannered, sociable, playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair to semi-long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Brown, orange, gray, cream, black, white</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, bicolor, tabby, calico, tortoiseshell; with or without white</p><p>Eye Color: Gold, green, blue, odd-eyed</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Russia</p><h2>Kurilian Bobtail Characteristics</h2><p>Active and outgoing, Kurilian bobtails are charming companions that love to cuddle and play. Thanks to its exceptionally easy-going personality, the Kurilian bobtail gets along with everyone, including gentle children. That laid-back temperament extends to the animal kingdom as well; the Kurilian bobtail typically co-exists peacefully with family pets including other cats and friendly dogs.</p><h2>History of the Kurilian Bobtail</h2><p>The Kurilian bobtail hails from the Russian Kamchatka peninsula on the islands of Sakhalin and Kuril. Though no one knows for sure exactly how old the breed is, the Kurilian bobtail developed naturally on the islands at least 200 years ago.</p><p>The unique cat with its distinctive tail caught the eye of visiting explorers (sailors, scientists, or military personnel), and they brought some of the cats back with them to central Russia in the mid-1900s. Russians appreciated the cats' fine hunting skills and put them to work dispatching rodents. The breed spread to Europe, but it is still largely unknown in North America.</p><p>The Kurilian bobtail is recognized by the International Cat Association (TICA). In 2012, the breed was granted championship status by TICA, which allows cats to compete in cat shows for titles. </p><h2>Kurilian Bobtail Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Kurilian bobtail's silky coat resists matting, so it is easy to care for. Weekly brushing with a slicker brush will remove loose hair. The occasional bath will keep the coat feeling clean and soft.</p><p>Trim your Kurilian bobtail's nails every two weeks, and check inside the ears weekly. If you see any redness or notice any odor, or if your cat is shaking its head or scratching at the ears, schedule an appointment with your veterinarian. If the ears appear dirty, clean with a pet ear cleaner using a cotton ball and or gauze (never use a cotton swab to clean a cat's ear). </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Kurilian bobtails are highly intelligent and love learning new things. You might be surprised to learn that Kurilian bobtails can easily be taught tricks. It's also simple to teach your Kurilian bobtail the house rules, though your cat may or may not choose to follow them. In general, the breed is easy to live with and fun to be around. </p><p>Kurilian bobtails are naturally quite active, but you can help your cat get enough exercise and indoor enrichment by providing places to climb and perch like cat trees and kitty condos, and engaging your cat in fun play by teasing with feather wands, toy mice, and interactive toys. To allow your cat to enjoy scratching, which is a natural behavior, provide a variety of acceptable scratching surfaces. Some cats like to scratch vertically (as with scratching posts or cat trees) and others prefer to scratch horizontally (as with cardboard or sisal scratchers that lie on the ground).</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although some pedigreed cat breeds are prone to developing certain genetically-linked diseases, the Kurilian bobtail is extremely healthy and currently has no known health concerns. Responsible breeders choose their breeding stock carefully and avoid breeding cats with any health issues. Many reputable breeders also offer a health guarantee of some kind.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>A compact and hefty cat, the medium to large-sized Kurilian bobtail has a solid build and substantial boning. The Kurilian bobtail is what is known as a natural breed, meaning it initially developed on its own without human intervention. It comes in various traditional solid or tabby colors, with or without white markings. </p><p>The Kurilian bobtail comes in two coat varieties: short and long (described as semi-long-haired by the breed standard). In both coat types, the soft, silky hair lies flat and has a moderate undercoat. In the short-haired variety, the tail hair is the same length as the hair on the body. Semi-long-haired Kurilians have a full, plumed tail.<br/></p><p>The Kurilian's tail is less than 5 inches long and has fewer than ten vertebrae (the average cat tail has 19 to 23 of these small spinal bones). The tail kinks or curves in a variety of directions, lending different looks described by the breed standard as ""snag,"" ""spiral,"" or ""whisk."" Like fingerprints or snowflakes, no two Kurilian bobtail tails are alike. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Obesity is a concern among cats in general. Cats should not be overfed or allowed to become overweight. Keeping your Kurilian bobtail at an ideal weight can reduce the incidence of certain health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Feed your Kurilian bobtail measured amounts of food at regular meal times (twice a day for adult cats). Free-feeding (leaving food out all day), leads to mindless snacking, which can contribute to weight gain. Ask your breeder or veterinarian to recommend a healthy food for your Kurilian bobtail cat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Kurilian Bobtail</h2><p>If you're thinking about buying a Kurilian bobtail kitten, consider visiting a local cat show, where you can see many different cat breeds and connect with reputable breeders. To find a cat show in your area, do an internet search for ""cat show near me."" </p><p>Reach out to breeders even if you're hoping to rescue. Because the breed is so rare, it's unlikely that you might find a Kurilian bobtail at your local animal shelter. The International Cat Association maintains a list of active breeders on its website.</p><h2>Kurilian Bobtail Overview</h2><p>The naturally developed Kurilian bobtail breed bears the wild look of its Russian ancestry with a charming personality that garners worldwide adoration. Although it is difficult to find one of these cats due to their rarity in the US, lucky owners enjoy the playful and affectionate companionship of their big, bob-tailed companions.</p><p>Low-maintenance but luxurious-looking coat<br/></p><p>Affectionate, friendly and outgoing </p><p>No known genetic health concerns</p><p>Rare (few breeders in the US) </p><p>Needs a lot of attention</p><p>Needs more exercise than some breeds</p>",1056

The name of the breed is Spanish in origin and often shortened to Presa Canario. When properly trained and socialized, the Presa Canario is docile, devoted, and obedient to its family however, they are natural guard dogs, highly suspicious of strangers, and will sometimes act aggressively toward people or animals they don't know.</p><p>With its thick and muscular rectangular body, attentive expression, and black mask, the Presa Canario is a strong-willed breed. Its broad, brachycephalic head shape usually features cropped ears, which add to its formidable expression and also prevents damage while working with cattle.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working Group</p><p>HEIGHT: 22 to 26 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 84 to 110 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short and coarse</p><p>COAT COLOR: Seen in brown/black, fawn, or brindle; occasionally with white markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 9 to 11 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Calm, gentle, stubborn, alert, bold, stubborn</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Spain</p><h2>Characteristics of the Presa Canario</h2><p>While initially slow to warm up, the Presa Canario has a gentle and sweet disposition, especially around people they trust. They are a confident breed, with an even keel and large presence. The Presa Canario's stance is firm and vigilant, combined with a calm and confident temperament.</p><h2>History of the Presa Canario</h2><p>Traditionally used for herding cattle, its intimidating appearance and hyper-awareness make the Presa Canario an ideal guard dog. Also known as the ""Canary Dog of Prey,"" the breed is said to date back to the 15th and 16th centuries after the conquest of the Canary Islands, when larger dogs would serve the very important roles of guarding farms, working cattle, and even exterminating wild or stray dogs.</p><p>The roots of the Presa Canario can be traced back to the cattle breed Iberian Presa (Perro de Ganado Majorero), an average-size mastiff breed and intuitive guard dog. Several other breeds may have contributed to the formation of the Presa Canario, in particular, the Presa Espanol, as well as the Bardino Majorero, a sheepdog originating on the Island of Fuerteventura.</p><p>Over time, these island dogs evolved into differentiated breeds, and the Presa Canario became known for its intelligence, courage, and physical resistance, along with its ability to exude natural guardian instincts, even without the need for excessive barking. Not surprisingly, these dogs were also often bred for dogfighting.</p><p>During the 1940s, dog fighting was prohibited throughout the islands, but fights were known to continue throughout the next decade, and it was during this time that Presa Canario numbers faltered thanks to the introduction of alternate fighting breeds such as the Great Dane, Doberman Pinscher, and German Shepherd. It nearly caused the extinction of the Presa Canario, which were relegated in small numbers to farmers and herdsmen as their primary guard dog.</p><p>Fortunately, during the 1970s, reputable breeders bred Presa Canarios that were both massive and courageous as well as functional with acute watchdog instincts, a headstrong, courageous temperament, and an extremely territorial nature. Full recovery of the Presa Canario breed began in 1982 when a group of breeders from the island of Tenerife formed an association to support the resurgence of the Presa Canario. Today, the breed serves as the animal symbol of Gran Canaria. It has been recorded in the Foundation Stock Service since 1996.</p><p>Due to its territorial tendencies, the Presa Canario has been banned from several countries. The breed is allowed in the United States, but not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club. However, they are accepted by the AKC Foundation Stock Service, which provides a secure location for its records and permits the dogs to compete in AKC companion events.</p><h2>Presa Canario Care</h2><p>While protective and devoted to its family, this breed is generally better suited for experienced, active owners who can properly socialize their Presa Canario and provide ample opportunity for outdoor activity. Because of its history as a guard dog, the breed is strong-willed, powerful, intelligent, and very suspicious of strangers and therefore may require increased opportunities for socialization and training early in life to safely interact with others, particularly in a home with children or other pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>This high-energy breed will crave daily exercise, including playtime outdoors or multiple walks each day. They can also learn indoor games like hide-and-seek or new tricks, as they're eager to please their owner and highly trainable. The Presa Canario's robust, muscular physique and athletic prowess means it can engage in higher-intensity outdoor activities like swimming, hiking, and retrieving balls or flying discs.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Perro de Presa Canario will require occasional bathing to keep its short coat clean but may require regular grooming and brushing given its shedding. This breed also boasts strong, fast-growing nails that will need to be frequently trimmed with a nail clipper or grinder. The dog's short ears should be checked on a routine basis, and teeth should be brushed regularly.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>These dogs can be calm, affectionate, and obedient, but only with the proper training from experienced owners. They have a powerful natural instinct to attack anything that appears to be a threat. Intensive socialization and obedience training as puppies and beyond is crucial for the Presa Canario breed, and they will respond best to fair, consistent training and clear limits.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Overall, the majority of Perro de Presa Canarios are healthy dogs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Presa Canario will perform well with any high-quality diet, whether their food is commercially prepared or cooked at home (with guidance from a veterinarian). As a larger, active breed, they may require more water than the average dog, and may also prefer higher-protein food.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Perro de Presa Canario</h2><p>Although the Presa Canario is not eligible for registration with the American Kennel Club, it is possible to find a reputable breeder. The United Perro de Presa Canario Club provides referrals to breeders, and the best way to find a Presa Canario rescue is to research rescue groups online.</p><h2>Perro de Presa Canarios Overview</h2><p>Highly intelligent</p><p>Easy to train</p><p>Loves to play outdoors and perform tricks</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise</p><p>May not be suitable for families with young children due to its attack instincts</p><p>Needs intensive socialization and obedience training</p>",1008

It does, in fact, have huskies in its ancestry mixed with other breeds to diminish its size. It comes in three sizes: toy, miniature, and standard. With its high energy, intelligence, and alert nature, the Alaskan klee kai can be quite the handful compared to some other dogs its size. Still, it generally is very loyal and bonds closely with its owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: N/A</p><p>HEIGHT: 13 inches and under (toy), 13 to 15 inches (miniature), 15 to 17.5 inches (standard)</p><p>WEIGHT: 6 to 12 pounds (toy), 10 to 18 pounds (miniature), 16 to 25 pounds (standard)</p><p>COAT: Medium-length, wiry</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black and white, gray and white, or red and white</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 16 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Alert, loyal, intelligent</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Alaskan Klee Kai</h2><p>Being energetic and alert are hallmarks of the Alaskan klee kai's personality. They have playful personalities and tend to love their owners but be wary of strangers. </p><h2>History of the Alaskan Klee Kai</h2><p>An Alaskan breeder named Linda Spurlin began the development of Alaskan klee kai in the 1970s. Spurlin wanted to create a smaller version of the huskies she was familiar with that had her ideal look and temperament. </p><p>Using selective breeding, she crossed Alaskan and Siberian huskies with American Eskimo dogs and schipperkes. The result was a small dog that still could handle the rough Alaskan terrain and could be a good companion. The name klee kai comes from the indigenous Athabaskan language and means ""little dog."" </p><p>The breed is still fairly rare but has gained popularity over the decades. The American Kennel Club doesn't recognize it yet, but it accepted the breed into Foundation Stock Service (which records breeding) in 2020.</p><h2>Alaskan Klee Kai Care</h2><p>As high-energy and intelligent dogs, Alaskan klee kai need lots of physical activity and mental stimulation. They are moderately receptive to training, as they can be both smart and stubborn at times. Furthermore, their grooming is relatively straightforward. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These dogs need an active owner who can give them at least a solid hour of exercise per day. A bored Alaskan klee kai can easily engage in problem behaviors, such as becoming destructive or excessively vocal.</p><p>Long walks, jogs, and hikes are ideal, as Alaskan klee kai generally have excellent endurance. Dog sports, such as agility, also can help to challenge them both mentally and physically. And food puzzles can keep your dog busy when you need a break.</p><p>Make sure to keep your dog on a leash or in a secure fenced area. These dogs can be difficult to train to come when they're called. And despite their small size, they have the athleticism to run away quickly.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>These dogs have a short, dense undercoat and a medium-length, wiry outer coat. They shed a moderate amount, though shedding typically increases twice a year in the spring and fall. Brush at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent mats; up to daily brushing might be necessary during the high-shedding periods. </p><p>Fortunately, the coat naturally repels dirt and stays pretty clean, so usually only the occasional bath is necessary. Check your dog's nails once a month or so to see whether they need trimming. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>These bright dogs generally are quick to learn and enjoy mental challenges. However, they also have an independent and free-thinking side to their personality that can complicate training. They tend to respond well to positive and rewards-based training methods. Making training seem like a game to them often is a great way to get results. </p><p>Aim to start training as early as possible with a puppy obedience class. And start socializing your dog when it's still young as well. Alaskan klee kai can be reserved around strangers and often bark when something is unsettling to them. So providing them with positive experiences around different people and situations can help to build their comfort and confidence.</p><p>Hyrel / Wikimedia Commons / Public Domain </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Alaskan klee kai overall are healthy dogs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available to your dog.

Called ""moggies"" in the UK, these common cats have developed due to feral and non-selective breeding. But, a lack of papers does not detract from them being beautiful and loving companion animals. Their varied shapes, sizes, coat colors, and personalities make them fascinating and full of surprises.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Moggy, house cat, domestic cat</p><p>Personality: Generally friendly and affectionate, though some may be less outgoing than others and activity levels vary</p><p>Weight: Up to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 25 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair, long hair, or medium hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Most common colors include black, white, gray, and red (orange)</p><p>Coat Patterns: Varies tabby, calico, tortoiseshell, bicolor, colorpoint</p><p>Eye Color: Gold, green, or blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Middle East</p><h2>Mixed-Breed Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Mixed-breed cats can be short-haired, fluffy, patterned, or tailless, depending on their lineage, which is often a mystery since it's difficult if not impossible to trace the ancestry of the average cat.</p><p>While some indications of temperament can be gleaned from physical characteristics derived from a cat's ancestry, the personality of a mixed-breed cat can vary widely from shy and reclusive (like a Russian blue) to outgoing and personable (like a Siamese).</p><p>Mixed-breed cats also come in a variety of sizes and weights, from petite 7-pounders to double-digit hunks. Again, it depends on the genetics that dominate the cat's lineage.</p><h2>History of the Mixed-Breed Cat</h2><p>Domestic cats have a rich history. Cats are believed to have first been domesticated in the Middle East when humans developed agriculture (estimated 12,000 years ago). Cats served to keep rodents away from stored grain. They were considered sacred by the Egyptians and mummified with their owners. A 9,000-year-old grave on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus revealed a cat buried with a human, presumably due to being a companion animal.</p><p>Domestic cats spread throughout Europe, Asia, and Africa but were unknown in the Americas or Australia until European explorers transported them. Cats were part of sailing life (for rodent control), and these far-ranging ships introduced cats to the New World.<br/></p><p>Biologically, a mixed-breed cat is a cross between cats of two or more different breeds. Many pure breeds have been developed by breeding mixed-breed cats with specific desirable characteristics</p><h2>Mixed-Breed Cat Care</h2><p>Most cats are self-cleaning and fastidious by nature. Brush your cat as needed to help reduce matting and prevent hairballs, particularly in long-haired cats. Trim your cat's nails every two to three weeks and provide a scratching post. If your cat allows it, brush its teeth regularly. Cats will usually need dental cleanings by a veterinarian.<br/></p><p>Indoor-only cats have the longest lifespans. For example, indoor cats can live up to 14 to 20 years; meanwhile, the average lifespan for an outdoor cat is 3 to 10. When outdoors, cats can be exposed to infections from other animals, get into gruesome fights, get attacked by predators, or may get run over by vehicles. Outdoor cats can also cause injury or death to birds and other wildlife.</p><p>Indoor cats need a litter box in a quiet area. Be sure to clean the box at least once a week completely. Using clumping litter and scooping out the clumps daily can keep things tidy.</p><p>Your indoor cat also needs plenty of chances to play and chase toys, but cats like lots of sleep and cat naps, so provide a comfortable bed and other places around your living area where your cat can lounge and retreat.</p><p>Cats have a wide variety of personalities, ranging from standoffish to clingy. Early socialization with various people can help a cat be less timid around newcomers. Cats often do well with other cats and cat-friendly dogs, especially if raised together. However, domestic cats still have predatory instincts for rodents, birds, and fish, whether or not they are pets. It's best to keep those animals safely away from your cat.</p><h2>Common Health Problem</h2><p>Mixed breeds are generally healthier than pure breeds since they are not prone to breed-specific diseases. Of course, no cat is 100 percent risk-free from health concerns.</p><p>Spay or neuter your pet by age 5 months if you do not intend to breed your cat. Be sure to stay up-to-date on veterinary visits and vaccinations to prevent common and serious problems.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Mixed-breed cats can possess any color or pattern seen in purebred cats, or they may show a combination of colors and patterns. They can have short or long hair and be small or large. If variety is the spice of life, as the old adage says, then mixed-breed cats certainly make pet owners' lives more interesting and fulfilling!</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Cats are naturally carnivores and require a sufficient amount of the amino acid taurine in their diets. A wet food diet is often considered best to provide nutrition and hydration, but you can leave out dry food for your cat to snack on as well. Provide fresh, clean water for your cat at all times.</p><p>It is good to monitor your cat's weight and take steps to prevent excess weight gain, which can shorten your pet's lifespan. Discuss your cat's needs with your veterinarian, especially if your cat has diabetes, is obese, or is older.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mixed-Breed Cat</h2><p>The best places to find mixed-breed cats and kittens are adoption shelters where countless homeless cats of all colors and personalities await loving families. The ASPCA states, ""Approximately 6.3 million companion animals enter US animal shelters nationwide every year. Of those, approximately 3.2 million are cats.""</p><h2>Mixed-Breed Cat Overview</h2><p>Mixed-breed cats make marvelous companions for most people, whether they live alone or with families. If you're not looking for a very specific shape, color, or temperament in a cat, then the surprises offered by a ""moggy"" are nothing but delightful.</p><p>Even, if your cat resembles a known cat breed, you will not be able to enter it in a cat show as a specific breed (papers are required).

These dogs can be intense due to their high energy and intelligence, and they need an active owner to match that pace. They make great running or biking partners, love canine competitions, and are very affectionate with their owners. But they don't always get along well with strangers or other animals. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 25 to 45 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, blue, fawn, or red with tan and/or red markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Energetic, affectionate, courageous</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the German Pinscher</h2><p>A high energy level is a hallmark of the German pinscher's temperament. These dogs also tend to have loving personalities with their family, though they are watchful dogs and only moderately open to strangers. </p><h2>History of the German Pinscher</h2><p>The German pinscher was developed in the 1800s as a utilitarian farm dog. It is believed to have been the result of breeding between European farm dogs used for guarding and herding.</p><p>Interestingly, ""pinscher"" is a German word meaning ""to nip or seize,"" which describes one of the breed's original functions. The German pinscher was often tasked with ridding farms of small rodents, most notably rats. Agile movements, a keen prey drive, and nearly endless energy made this dog breed a valuable asset on many German homesteads.</p><p>The German pinscher and the schnauzer were originally categorized as the same breed. The German pinscher with its sleek, smooth coat was considered the short-hair version of the wiry, long-hair schnauzer. But over time the varieties became distinct breeds. The German pinscher also played a key role in the development of the Doberman, miniature pinscher, and Rottweiler. The American Kennel Club first recognized the German pinscher in 2003.</p><h2>German Pinscher Care</h2><p>It's crucial to provide a German pinscher with sufficient physical activity and mental stimulation each day. Otherwise, it can become hyperactive and develop other problem behaviors. Dedicating time to training and socialization also is a must. Luckily, grooming this dog is a fairly easy task.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>A German pinscher needs an outlet for its energy and will benefit from at least one to two hours of physical activity per day. Long walks, running, cycling, hiking, and energetic games of fetch all are good ways to exercise your dog. It's ideal to have a securely fenced location where your dog can stretch its legs running around. Dog sports, such as agility, also are excellent to challenge German pinschers both mentally and physically. </p><p>When German pinschers are subjected to a sedentary lifestyle or don't receive enough mental stimulation, they have a tendency to pace, whine, or even resort to destructive behaviors, such as chewing. If you don't have enough time or energy to keep up with this dog's needs, it might not be the breed for you.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The German pinscher is a moderate shedder. Brushing weekly to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils is typically all that's necessary. Shedding can pick up seasonally, often in the spring and fall, at which time you might have to add an additional brushing to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Give your dog a bath roughly once a month, depending on how dirty it gets. And check the nails monthly as well to see whether they need a trim. Plus, look in your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup and other debris or irritation. Finally, aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>German pinschers are highly intelligent and typically can learn commands with ease, responding well to positive training methods. However, they also can be strong-willed and cunning. If you're not consistent with your commands, they might try to get away with some bad behaviors. </p><p>Start training as young as possible to instill good habits and assert yourself as the leader. But don't mistake being a leader with using fear and intimidation to train your German pinscher. This is an intuitive breed that reads emotions from its owner; harsh training tactics can cause a rift between dog and owner.</p><p>Socialize your dog from a young age, as well, with various people and in a variety of situations to boost its comfort and confidence. The alert nature of the German pinscher has the potential to morph into aggression if a dog is not properly socialized in identifying and respecting guests you invite into your home. This breed might do well with other dogs if they've been raised together.

A true gentle giant, the wolfhound has an imposing stature but calm demeanor that makes it a wonderful companion. It was originally bred as a big game hunter but now is primarily a family dog. It's generally an easygoing dog but needs ample space to move and play. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: At least 30 inches (female), at least 32 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 105 pounds (female), 120 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Medium-length, wiry</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, blue, brindle, creme, gray, red, silver, white, wheaten </p><p>LIFE SPAN: 6 to 8 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Courageous, Calm, Even-Tempered</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Ireland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Irish Wolfhound</h2><p>Irish wolfhounds generally have a friendly temperament despite their imposing size. They are typically very affectionate with their family and overall have an easygoing, quiet personality. With proper training and socialization, they can even be good around kids. While they only possess a moderate energy level, they need lots of space to exercise their large bodies.</p><h2>History of the Irish Wolfhound</h2><p>The history of the Irish wolfhound stretches back centuries to the birth of trade between the British empire and the Middle East. Dogs native to Britain were bred with Middle Eastern hounds that had been bartered. One of the earliest accounts of the breed is from a Roman consul, who in the year 391 described seven majestic Irish hounds he received as a gift.</p><p>People used the large hounds to hunt big game. And in the 15th century, they were put to work in hunting the overpopulation of wolves in Ireland. In fact, they were such effective hunters that the wolves were hunted to extinction and consequently the wolfhound breed almost died out because it had served its purpose. </p><p>However, in the mid-1800s, a British army captain found the remaining Irish wolfhounds and worked to preserve and standardize the breed. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Irish wolfhound in 1897.</p><h2>Irish Wolfhound Care</h2><p>The Irish wolfhound may be a gentle giant, but it still requires lots of time and energy on your part. You must make sure your dog has the chance to stretch its legs every day. And be consistent in training and socialization. Fortunately, the Irish wolfhound's grooming needs are fairly simple, even for such a big dog.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least an hour each day exercising your wolfhound. Many make excellent jogging or running partners (once their skeletal system is fully developed), and they enjoy long walks and hikes. Ideally your wolfhound also will have access to a fenced yard where it can really stretch its legs running and moving at will. And participating in dog sports, such as tracking and agility, can challenge your wolfhound's body and mind.</p><p>Always keep in mind that this dog breed is a sighthound, and its prey drive can kick in at any time. So it's best only to let your wolfhound run free in an enclosed space.</p><p>When properly exercised, the Irish wolfhound is usually quite docile in the house. In fact, some owners find they have to coax their dog to exercise each day. Irish wolfhounds can be quite the couch potato.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The double coat of Irish wolfhounds sheds a moderate amount, and it actually doesn't have seasonal periods of higher shedding like many other breeds do. Brush at least weekly to remove loose fur and debris. And bathe your dog every one to two months, depending on how dirty it gets.</p><p>Check the ears at least weekly for any dirt, irritation, and other abnormalities. And check the nails roughly once a month to see whether they're in need of a trim. Also, aim to brush your dog's teeth every day. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Irish wolfhounds typically do well with training because they are attentive to their owners. However, don't become lax in your lessons or you'll have a very large and dominant dog on your hands. Make sure to instill clear obedience lessons in your hound from puppyhood, and socialize it well for a balanced and amicable animal.</p><p>Aim to expose your dog to different people and various situations from as young of an age as possible to instill comfort and confidence. And always use positive training methods; harsh corrections and bad experiences can cause these sensitive dogs to shut down and not learn.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available to your dog. And expect to have a hefty food budget to feed this big breed. Most owners feed two measured meals per day. It's best to choose a dog food that's specifically formulated for large breeds to make sure you're meeting your dog's nutritional needs. Discuss the variety and amount with your vet, as this can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. Also, be mindful of treats and extra food to prevent your dog from becoming overweight and putting too much stress on its joints. </p><p>Also, like other deep-chested dogs, Irish wolfhounds are at risk of bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twists. This often can arise when a dog eats too quickly. Using puzzle toys that slowly dispense food, feeding smaller meals, and restricting activity right after meals all can help to prevent bloat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Irish Wolfhound</h2><p>Irish wolfhounds aren't a common sight at animal shelters, but it's still worth looking at your local shelters for a dog in need of a home. Also, see whether there's a breed-specific rescue in your area. For a reputable breeder puppy, expect to pay around $2,000, though this can vary depending on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Irish Wolfhound Overview</h2><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Relatively quiet and calm</p><p>Often good with children</p><p>Short life span</p><p>Strong prey drive</p><p>Prone to some hereditary health problems</p>",945

Despite their wildcat looks, American bobtails are often referred to as the ""golden retrievers of the feline world"" because of their affectionate, docile personalities. What's more, they generally love to fetch toys and are easily leash trained.</p><p>These cats make great companions for single people as well as families with kids and other pets; they also adapt well to unusual living quarters like RVs, semi trucks, and sailboats.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, sociable, playful, adaptable, and intelligent</p><p>Weight: Up to 16 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 30 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair, long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Any color, but breed standard favors ""wild"" colors</p><p>Coat Patterns: Any, but breed standard favors ""wild"" markings</p><p>Eye Color: Copper, gold, yellow, green, blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>American Bobtail Characteristics</h2><p>American bobtails are ideal pets for just about anyone in any living situation. These sturdy, large cats adapt beautifully to family life with kids or other pets, but they also bond deeply with single humans. Because of their open, friendly temperaments even with strangers American bobtails are often employed as therapy cats.</p><p>They need only moderate amounts of exercise, so they can be happy living in smaller homes and have been known to enjoy mobile lifestyles alongside truckers, RVers, and even sailors!</p><h2>History of the American Bobtail</h2><p>Because bobbed tails are the result of a natural and harmless genetic mutation in felines, these cats have naturally bred worldwide throughout history. It wasn't until the 1960s that the American bobtail became an officially developed and recognized breed.</p><p>Vacationers John and Brenda Sanders adopted a bobtailed cat while visiting Arizona and allowed him to mate with their female when they returned home to Iowa. The result? A litter of kittens with short tails and sweet personalities.</p><p>After the original American bobtail litter, other breeders followed suit, selectively breeding cats for shortened tails, sturdy bodies, ""wild"" markings, and super-sweet dispositions. Proponents of the breed broadcast the fact that pedigreed cats have never been used in bobtail breeding, so the gene pool is extremely diverse. Breeders simply adhere to the practice of breeding unregistered long-haired and short-haired domestic cats with desirable bobtail traits.</p><p>Since their development in the 1960s, American bobtails have been officially recognized by the International Cat Association (TICA), the Cat Fanciers; Association (CFA), and the American Cat Fanciers' Association (ACFA).</p><h2>American Bobtail Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>American bobtails are relatively low-maintenance cats. You can expect to brush your bobtail once or twice per week to remove shed hair and skin and keep its coat shiny and healthy. Twice a year, bobtails will shed more than usual due to seasonal changes, and they may require more frequent brushing during these times.</p><p>In any breed of cat, poor dental hygiene can lead to periodontal disease, so it's important to brush your bobtail's teeth at least once per week. Supplementing with plaque-controlling treats can help maintain dental health, but should never be the only method of dental hygiene you use on your cat.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>American bobtails are docile cats with moderate energy levels and minimal exercise requirements. They do appreciate a few minutes of daily playtime, though. Like dogs, bobtails love to play with toys, fetch small items like faux mice, and try their paws at puzzle games. Many American bobtails enjoy going on leisurely leashed walks, too.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>American bobtails are hearty cats that have no breed-specific health conditions. Of course, that doesn't mean that every American bobtail will remain perfectly healthy throughout its life.</p><p>Bobtails with tail may experience spinal issues leading to fecal incontinence. If you're buying a bobtail from a breeder, ensure they have a written health guarantee, which can offer some assurance against spinal issues.</p><p>If you're concerned about health issues in your cat, be sure to talk to your vet about preventative measures you can take to ensure a long, healthy life.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The American bobtail breed can vary in appearance, but it generally boasts a relatively large, sturdy build that is well muscled and powerful-looking, It has a broad head, wide eyes, and alert ears.</p><p>The most prominent feature of this cat is its short tail, ranging in length from under an inch to a few inches long. According to the breed standard, the tail should be long enough to be visible above the back when held straight up.</p><p>The cat's hair may be short and dense or long and shaggy. Ideally, it is brownish or gray with tabby-type patterning that resembles a wild lynx or bobcat.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your American bobtail's diet will depend on its age, activity levels, and general health, but in general, should be fed high-quality, high-protein food. If you'd like to add some variation to your bobtail's diet, you can try mixing some wet food in with its dry food a few times per week.</p><p>Obesity is a common problem in all breeds of cats, so it's important to follow feeding guidelines closely and give treats in moderation. If you're not sure how much to feed your bobtail, your vet will be able to provide some helpful guidelines.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American Bobtail</h2><p>The American bobtail cat breed is relatively rare in the United States, making it difficult to find a reputable breeder. The American Cat Fanciers' Association maintains a breeder list that currently only contains two US breeders one in North Dakota and the other in Wisconsin.</p><p>Check with other local cat breeders and online networks to track down breeders with established businesses and positive reviews. If you're not overly concerned with owning a registered breed, you might also explore adoption sites to find a bobtailed cat that captures your heart.</p><h2>American Bobtail Overview</h2><p>The American bobtail cat is a coveted breed among its enthusiasts for several great reasons. These genetically diverse and healthy cats have wonderful personalities and are adaptable to myriad living situations. They tend to get along with everyone and are so friendly with strangers that they make excellent candidates for therapy pets. As wildly beautiful as they are affectionate, bobtails are pretty much a perfect pet for anyone who craves a feline companion.</p><p>Friendly with everyone</p><p>Adaptable to most households even mobile ones</p><p>Beautiful and relatively low maintenance</p><p>Rare; may be hard to find</p><p>Doesn't enjoy being alone for long</p><p>Extremely short tail (or no tail) can cause spinal problems</p>",1037

It's an ancient spitz-type dog breed that was bred to hunt large game. Today, it's primarily a companion dog that's known for its friendly, loyal, and energetic demeanor. It also is a highly intelligent dog with an independent streak that would do best with an active owner and in a cooler climate.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 19.5 inches (female), 20.5 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 48 pounds (female), 55 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black and gray; black and silver; black, white, and silver; gray, black, and silver</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, friendly, affectionate</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Norway<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Norwegian Elkhound</h2><p>Norwegian elkhounds generally have a loyal and dependable temperament. They can be quite protective and vocal watchdogs. But with proper training and socialization, they typically have friendly personalities. </p><h2>History of the Norwegian Elkhound</h2><p>The Norwegian elkhound has a long history in Norway, with skeletal remains dating back all the way to 5000 B.C. There are tales of these dogs being steadfast shipmates to Vikings. And they were used to protect property and livestock while being friendly companions to their families. </p><p>Hunters also used the Norwegian elkhound for large game, including elk and moose. The hounds were adept at following scent trails and holding game at bay. These dogs also were fierce and fearless enough to protect farms from bears, wolves, and other wild animals. </p><p>The breed largely remained in Norway until the 19th century, when it then started popping up around Europe. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Norwegian elkhound in 1913.<br/></p><h2>Norwegian Elkhound Care</h2><p>The Norwegian elkhound is a high-energy dog breed that needs lots of daily activity. It also requires consistent training and socialization. And you must keep up on grooming its thick coat.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bred to follow their hunting quarry over long distances, Norwegian elkhounds are high-energy dogs with good strength and stamina. They should get at least one to two hours of exercise per day via walks, jogging, playtime, and other activities. They also like to hike and swim, though it's best to keep them on leash when not in a secure area. Otherwise, their prey drive can cause them to take off following a scent.</p><p>Norwegian elkhounds also can excel in dog sports, such as agility and herding, which can exercise both their bodies and their minds. Puzzle toys are great for exercising their minds as well. Just make sure to keep outdoor exercise brief in hot weather, as this breed's thick coat can make it sensitive to the heat.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The thick double coat of the Norwegian elkhound needs regular brushing to remove loose fur and prevent mats. It's recommended to run a brush through the coat for a few minutes every day to stay on top of the loose fur. That also will help to limit the amount of dog fur that ends up on your furniture and clothes. A couple times a year, usually in the spring and fall, expect periods of heavier shedding during which you'll have to brush more extensively. </p><p>The good news is the Norwegian elkhound's coat doesn't tend to have an odor and only needs an occasional bath when your dog gets dirty. Plan to check the nails to see whether they need a trim roughly every month. And aim to brush your dog's teeth daily. Also, look in its ears every week or so to ensure there's no wax buildup, irritation, or other abnormalities.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Norwegian elkhound is a very bright dog and can learn tricks and other skills quickly. However, it also can be independent and stubborn at times and can get bored with obedience training. Keep training sessions short and fun, and always use positive reinforcement methods. Plus, start as young as possible with basic obedience, and be consistent with your commands to prevent bad habits from developing. </p><p>Likewise, aim to socialize your Norwegian elkhound from as young of an age as possible. These dogs are usually adaptable and open to meeting strangers, especially when they've had positive experiences around people since they were a puppy. But due to their watchdog nature, they likely will still bark at people and other animals that pass by your home.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Norwegian elkhounds are generally a very healthy dog breed and have a relatively long lifespan.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p><br/>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But you should always run both the type of food and the amount by your vet first to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Norwegian elkhounds generally love to eat and will beg for extra food. So it's important to watch their daily intake to make sure they're not overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Norwegian Elkhound</h2><p>While the Norwegian elkhound is a relatively rare breed, it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups to see whether there's a dog in need of a home. For a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $700 to $5,000, though this can vary widely. <br/></p><h2>Norwegian Elkhound Overview</h2><p>Loyal and affectionate</p><p>Good watchdog</p><p>Generally healthy breed</p><p>Can be very vocal</p><p>Sheds a lot</p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p>",923

It can make for a charming lapdog, though it does still need daily exercise. The Maltese also can be an alert and fearless watchdog, despite its small size. Plus, it can be a good option for those who want a low-shedding dog, though it does require some involved grooming.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 7 to 9 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: Under 7 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, silky</p><p>COAT COLOR: White, black points</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, alert, fearless</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Malta/Mediterranean region</p><h2>Characteristics of the Maltese</h2><p>Maltese tend to be very affectionate with their family. But their watchdog tendencies can make them somewhat defensive around strangers. They can be a bit stubborn when it comes to training, and they are a medium-energy breed.</p><h2>History of the Maltese</h2><p>The Maltese can be traced back thousands of years to the Mediterranean region, specifically Malta. The breed can be found on ancient Greek pottery and was even admired by the philosopher Aristotle. </p><p>Roman aristocrats kept Maltese as status symbols and carried the petite dogs around with them. Unlike many small dog breeds, the Maltese was not bred down from larger dogs; it has always had its small stature. </p><p>After the fall of the Roman Empire, Maltese numbers diminished. But Chinese breeders kept the breed alive and refined it via crosses with their toy breeds. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1888, and it has remained popular to this day.</p><h2>Maltese Care</h2><p>Maltese need exercise and playtime every day, and they prefer to receive a lot of attention. They need proper training and socialization to ensure they have good manners. And they have fairly high grooming needs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Maltese have a moderate energy level. They should get at least a half hour to an hour of exercise per day via brisk walks, hikes, fetch, and other play. Puzzle toys and even dog sports like agility can help challenge them mentally, as well. Due to their small size, they don't require that much space to get in a good workout.</p><p>Note that the breed does not tolerate extreme temperatures well, as it lacks an insulating undercoat. It's best to keep outdoor exercise short in cold weather, and provide your dog with a coat or sweater.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The silky coat of the Maltese grows continuously. For easier maintenance, many owners opt to trim the coat short, and it takes on a wavy, fluffy quality. Others keep the coat long and flowing.</p><p>Because of this coat type, routine grooming is an absolute necessity. The Maltese should be brushed two to three times per week and up to daily if the coat is kept long. Regular trims will be necessary as well to maintain the desired coat length.</p><p>Furthermore, weekly to monthly baths will be necessary to keep the coat clean. Check to see whether the ears need cleaning weekly, and see whether your dog is due for a nail trim roughly once a month. In addition, Maltese are prone to showing tear stains underneath their eyes. There are products available at pet stores to help remove these stains. Moreover, those cute bows or topknots you see on a Maltese serve the purpose of keeping the hair out of the dog's eyes to prevent irritation.</p><p>Finally, this breed needs good attention to dental hygiene to prevent teeth and gum problems. Aim to brush your dog's teeth daily, and take it for professional cleaning as needed.</p><h3>Training</h3><p><br/>Like all dogs, the Maltese needs proper training and socialization to be happy and well-adjusted. These dogs can be somewhat headstrong, and centuries of living closely with people have taught them how to get what they want. However, they still respond fairly well to training when offered treats and other positive reinforcement. </p><p>Aim to start training and socialization when your dog is a puppy. Enroll in a puppy obedience class as soon as your dog meets the age requirement. And expose it to different people, other animals, and various situations. Maltese can be protective around strangers and in strange situations, potentially barking a lot or nipping. So it's important to instill comfort and confidence in them, along with good manners. </p><p>Furthermore, many Maltese exhibit separation anxiety if they're left alone for long periods. They might bark continuously and engage in destructive behaviors. Behavioral training can help curb some anxiety. However, it's best for a Maltese to live in a household where someone is home for most of the day.</p><p>In addition, as a delicate little dog, the Maltese is not recommended for a household with small children due to the risk of injury to the dog. But it might be a suitable choice for families with gentle older children.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Maltese are usually healthy dogs, though they are prone to some hereditary health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your Maltese. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced dog food. Most owners opt to feed two meals per day. A diet formulated for small dogs can be ideal, as the pieces will typically be smaller and easier to eat while providing proper nutrition. Monitor treats and other food intake to prevent overeating. Discuss the type of food and quantity with your vet to make sure your dog is getting what it needs for its size and lifestyle. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Maltese</h2><p>Check local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups to find a Maltese in need of a home.

It needs lots of mental stimulation and physical activity every day. These dogs generally have a moderately affectionate and friendly personality, but they do form strong bonds with their owners.</p><h2>History of the Belgian Malinois</h2><p>The Belgian Malinois is a native of Belgium and one of the four related varieties of Belgian shepherd dogs. The other three varieties are the Tervuren, the Groenendael, and the Laekenois. These Belgian shepherds date back to the 1800s, and the Malinois gets its name from the city of Malines where it was developed. Breeders were looking to create a strong herding dog and protector with a steadfast work ethic. </p><p>The Malinois first arrived in the United States in the early 1900s. Some were used as military dogs during World War I. The Great Depression and importation restrictions during World War II caused the breed to diminish in the U.S. But its popularity rose again in the 1960s. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Malinois in 1959.</p><p>By the turn of the 21st century, Belgian Malinois were commonly seen working as police dogs, military dogs, drug-detection dogs, and search-and-rescue dogs. The Secret Service even employs them to patrol the White House grounds. Plus, Belgian Malinois are part of Navy SEAL teams and have been used in operations, including that which resulted in the death of Osama bin Laden in 2011.</p><h2>Belgian Malinois Care</h2><p>The Belgian Malinois is not the right breed for everyone. These dogs generally aren't well-suited to living in an apartment, as they need lots of space to run and play. They're best for owners with an active lifestyle who can provide plenty of ways for the dogs to exercise their minds and bodies. These dogs also require proper training and socialization to ensure they are well-mannered. And their grooming is fairly simple. <br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>It is essential for a Belgian Malinois to receive vigorous daily exercise and mental stimulation. Otherwise, it might become anxious or develop behavior problems. Aim for at least one to two hours of exercise per day, including brisk walks, running, hiking, and playing fetch. This breed also is an excellent candidate for dog sports or any activity that involves focus and endurance to challenge it mentally and physically.</p><p>Be aware that the Belgian Malinois' herding instinct might create a tendency to chase cars, bikes, and other moving objects. So it must be kept on leash or in a secure fenced area. <br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Belgian Malinois has a short, straight, weather-resistant coat with a dense undercoat. In general, little more than basic grooming is necessary. Plan to brush at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent mats. Shedding often increases as the weather changes in the spring and fall, necessitating more regular brushing.</p><p>Check whether your dog needs a nail trim roughly once a month. Some dogs can go longer between nail trims if they naturally wear down their nails through activity, such as walking on pavement. Also, aim to brush its teeth daily.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>In general, this breed is highly trainable, intelligent, and eager to please. It responds well to positive reinforcement and consistent instruction. </p><p>Training and socialization should begin early in a Belgian Malinois' puppyhood. Enroll in a puppy obedience class as soon as your dog meets the age requirement, and expose your dog to different people, other animals, and situations. Belgian Malinois don't always get along with other dogs, but having positive exposure to other dogs from a young age can help. </p><p>Likewise, this breed isn't always appropriate for families with children. Its high herding instinct can cause it to try to nip at kids' heels. Even if you don't have kids, it's important to train your dog to be well-mannered around children, so you're always able to safely control situations. <br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure your dog has access to fresh water. Feed a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet; most owners feed two meals per day. Discuss the variety and quantity with your veterinarian, as this can vary based on age, size, activity level, and other factors.

Also called the Am Staff, this breed is known for its courage and power, but it also generally has an affectionate and loyal disposition. And, contrary to its tough appearance and ancestor, it is a gentle dog breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 17 to 18 inches (female), 18 to 19 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 40 to 55 pounds (female), 55 to 70 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short, stiff fur</p><p>Coat Color: Variety of colors, including black, brown, blue, fawn, red, and liver; brindle and/or white markings also possible</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Courageous, affectionate, protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Friendly and Trainable American Staffordshire Terrier</h3><h2>Characteristics of the American Staffordshire Terrier</h2><p>Most Am Staffs have a confident and friendly temperament. They typically don't bark excessively, and they strike a good balance between being high-energy dogs and couch potatoes. However, they do have a protective side to their personality that must be managed with training and socialization. </p><h2>History of the American Staffordshire Terrier</h2><p>The American Staffordshire terrier's roots can be traced back to the 18th and 19th century in England. The bulldogs and terriers of the time were commonly used in inhumane blood sports. And they were bred for desirable traits, including their muscular build, energy, stamina, confidence, and agility. </p><p>A mix of these dogs went into creating the British Staffordshire bull terrier. While this breed still was used in blood sports, it also was kept as a companion and used on farms and for other work. Eventually, those dogs arrived in the United States in the mid-1800s.</p><p>U.S. breeders created a larger Staffordshire terrier that ultimately became a distinct breed from the Staffordshire bull terrier, bearing the name American Staffordshire terrier. They also bred it to have a calmer and friendlier temperament than its ancestors. Since their arrival on the scene, Am Staffs have had a prominent place in American culture, including in film and TV and in the armed forces. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1936.</p><h2>American Staffordshire Terrier Care</h2><p>In general, the American Staffordshire terrier can become a loving and loyal companion for many types of households. With proper training and socialization, it can even coexist well with children and other household pets. And its exercise and grooming requirements typically aren't excessive.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Am Staffs have a moderate energy level. They should get between 1 and 2 hours of exercise per day that includes walks, jogs, fetch, and other active play. Puzzle toys also can help to challenge them mentally, and dog sports will provide both mental and physical stimulation. However, be cautious not to overdo activity in hot weather, as this breed can be sensitive to heat. <br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The short, stiff coat of the Am Staff is easy to maintain. Use a soft-bristle brush on it weekly to remove any loose fur and debris and to distribute oils. You can expect heavier shedding in the spring and fall as the weather changes, which will likely necessitate brushing two to three times per week to help capture all the loose fur.</p><p>Give your dog a bath roughly every couple months or more often if it gets dirty. And trim its nails roughly every month. Also, aim to brush its teeth daily. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>As with any dog breed, proper training is a must. Because there are misconceptions about pit bull-type dogs being labeled as dangerous, it's ideal for anyone who owns an Am Staff to be a positive ambassador for the breed with a well-mannered dog.</p><p>Am Staffs are a fairly smart breed, but they can be stubborn. Combine that with their exuberance and power, and training isn't always easy. So it's important to be consistent with your training and to start from puppyhood. Am Staff puppies should ideally go to puppy classes where they learn basic obedience and socialization. Consistent and positive reinforcement also can help both puppies and adults in training.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>This breed is generally healthy throughout its life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Offer your dog a quality, nutritionally balanced diet. Most owners feed two meals per day. But discuss the amount and types of food with your vet, as this can vary depending on such factors as age and activity level. Always monitor your dog's weight, and factor treats into their total daily food consumption. Also, make sure your dog always has access to clean water.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American Staffordshire Terrier</h2><p>Check your local animal shelters and rescue groups for American Staffordshire terriers in need of homes. Expect to pay around $2,000 on average for a breeder puppy, though this can vary widely depending on bloodline and other factors. Shelters and rescues typically charge much less for puppies and adults.

It's quite possibly one of the most recognized breeds in the world. Although you'll often see this breed referred to as the ""English bulldog,"" a reference to its country of origin, the official name is simply bulldog.</p><p>Bulldogs live happily in large homes or apartments. Their main concern is that they are inside with the family. They are dignified but funny, courageous but easy-going, and tenacious but sweet the bulldog is simply like no other breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 14 to 15 inches at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: 40 to 50 pounds</p><p>COAT: Straight, short, fine-textured, smooth, and glossy</p><p>COAT COLOR: Red, white, fawn, or fallow (pale brown), or any combination of these colors, with or without such patterns and markings as brindle, piebald, ticking, black masks, or black tipping</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 10 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Willful, friendly, gregarious, docile</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bulldog</h2><p>Bulldogs are extremely popular in both England and North America. Despite that furrowed brow and grumpy-looking scowl, bulldogs are amiable and sweet-natured companions. They are great family dogs and they get along with adults and kids alike. Bulldogs usually coexist peacefully with other pets, although some dogs of the same sex might not get along. Thanks to their extreme facial construction, bulldogs snort, snuffle, grunt, snore, slobber, and drool.</p><h2>History of the Bulldog</h2><p>In 13th-century England, the bulldog was used as a fighting dog in a gruesome sport known as bull-baiting. During this period, bulldogs looked and acted very different than they do today. In particular, they were much fiercer not suitable pets in the least. After blood sports like bull baiting were outlawed in England, bulldogs were out of a job, but some bulldog lovers sought to save the breed. With some judicious breeding, the bulldog was toned down into the slow, ambling, sweet, and loving pet we know and love today.</p><h2>Bulldog Care</h2><p>When exercising and training your bulldog, keep these important considerations in mind. The bulldog is extremely susceptible to heatstroke. Take extra precautions with your bulldog to avoid overheating on warm days: Don't exercise a bulldog outdoors in the heat and stay indoors with air conditioning if possible. Use fans, shade, and cooling pads, and provide access to cool drinking water.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bulldogs are sometimes labeled as lazy, and while it's true that bulldogs are one of the more sedate breeds, some enjoy more vigorous activities than just lying on the couch. Bulldogs like daily walks no more than 20 to 30 minutes, though and some crave more brisk exercise like off-leash fetch or romping at the dog park. Some superstar bulldogs even excel at competitive dog sports like obedience and agility.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The bulldog's short coat is easy to care for. Brief brushing sessions two or three times a week will get rid of any loose hairs and leave the coat looking and feeling great. The deep wrinkles require special care clean them using a cotton swab or cotton ball dipped in hydrogen peroxide and follow up with an application of cornstarch to keep them dry. Clean the ears once a week with a pet-safe ear cleanser and trim the nails weekly, as well. Bathe your bulldog monthly or when it gets dirty.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Bulldogs can be difficult to train as the breed can certainly be stubborn, but you only have to look to one of the famous skateboarding or surfing bulldogs to see that they are definitely capable of learning. You just need to find the right motivation. Positive-reinforcement methods like clicker training work best. Use tasty treats and keep sessions short to maintain the bulldog's attention span.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>It's no secret that the bulldog is not the healthiest dog breed.</p><p>Due to the multitude of health problems that occur commonly in the breed, vet bills can be quite high throughout the lifetime of a bulldog, a serious consideration when deciding to become a bulldog owner.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Bulldogs love to eat. Their love of food can cause some to eat more than they should and put on too much weight, which adds stress to their joints. Work with your veterinarian to determine how much your bulldog should be eating daily, and feed measured meals at scheduled times. Leaving food out all the time (free feeding) or eyeballing the amounts instead of using a measuring cup can pack on the pounds.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bulldog</h2><p>Bulldogs are unique in that they nearly always give birth via Cesarean section due to the construction of their bodies. This means bulldog puppies can be pricey. Expect to pay an average price of $2,500 or between $1,500 to $4,000 for an English bulldog pup. Many adult bulldogs are available for adoption through various rescue and adoption groups.</p><h2>Bulldog Overview</h2><p>Full of personality</p><p>Can live in any size dwelling, from a small apartment to a big house</p><p>Capable of fun agility skills, like skateboarding</p><p>Prone to health problems, such as breathing issues, eye disorders, and orthopedic problems</p><p>Drools, snorts, and passes a lot of gas</p><p>Territorial about their food</p>",837

The dog's square head is also a defining trait with its short muzzle and large, round eyes. Boston terriers typically like to be around their humans and are eager to please. They can be a great choice for a first-time dog owner who's looking for a small dog.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 to 25 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black and white; black, brindle, and white; brindle and white; seal and white; seal, brindle, and white</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, friendly, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Boston Terrier</h2><p>Boston terriers typically have a happy, friendly, and affectionate temperament. Their love of play and comical nature also help to mold their personality. They're typically good around people, including kids and strangers, and they often get along well with other pets.</p><h2>History of the Boston Terrier</h2><p>The Boston terrier's story began in the 1860s when a Boston man named William O'Brien purchased a bulldog-white English terrier mix from England named Judge. O'Brien ended up selling Judge to another Bostonian named Robert C. Hooper. Records refer to ""Hooper's Judge"" as the father of the Boston terrier breed from which all Bostons descend. </p><p>Judge was a muscular but fairly small dog, weighing in at around 30 pounds. His head was square, and his coat was dark brindle with a white stripe down his face. Judge was bred to a small, white, bulldog-type female. And that launched the selective breeding process. Breeders specifically were looking to create a small, friendly companion dog.</p><p>In 1891, the Boston Terrier Club of America was founded. And soon after in 1893, the American Kennel Club first recognized the breed. Since then, the Boston terrier has become quite popular throughout the United States. It's Boston University's official mascot, as well as the official dog for the state of Massachusetts. </p><h2>Boston Terrier Care</h2><p>Boston terriers require a moderate amount of exercise each day, and their grooming needs are simple. Plus, they should receive consistent training and socialization ideally starting at a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Boston terriers are relatively energetic and should receive about an hour of exercise per day. A couple of daily walks, games of fetch, playing with puzzle toys, and running around in a secure area should suffice. Dog sports, such as agility and rally, can help to burn their mental and physical energy. The key is that Bostons prefer to be active with their humans. If you leave them to their own devices, they might become bored and develop problem behaviors, such as unwanted chewing. </p><p>Moreover, due to the Boston's flat face, the breed is prone to breathing issues. Discuss this with your vet, and know how to spot the signs of labored breathing during exercise.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Boston terriers generally need little more than basic grooming, as their short coat doesn't shed much. Brush them weekly with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. </p><p>In addition, check your dog's nails every month or so to see whether they're due for a trim. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and other abnormalities. And brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socializing your Boston terrier from as young of an age as possible. Enrolling in a puppy obedience class is an ideal way for your dog to learn basic commands and manners. And exposing it to different people, other dogs, and various locations will help to boost its comfort and confidence.</p><p>Always use positive reinforcement methods, such as praise and treats, as this breed can be especially sensitive to harsh corrections. And be consistent in your commands. Boston terriers generally want to please their humans and will take to training well.</p><p>Because they typically love the company of people, Boston terriers can be prone to separation anxiety when left alone. Professional dog trainers and behaviorists can give you tips to help combat this. But a household where someone is home for most of the day is the best option for this breed.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Make sure your dog always has access to fresh water. And feed it a high-quality canine diet that's nutritionally balanced. Most owners feed two measured meals per day to ensure their dog is getting the proper amount. You should always discuss both the amount and type of food with your vet to verify that you're meeting the dog's individual needs. </p><p>Also, be mindful about treats and other extra food. Many Boston terriers have a strong love of food and will beg for handouts. But too many extras might result in your dog becoming overweight, as even a small weight increase can be a lot for this little dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Boston Terrier</h2><p>Boston terriers are a popular dog breed, especially in North America. So be sure to check local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $600 to $2,000, though this can vary widely.<br/></p><p><br/></p><h2>Boston Terrier Overview</h2><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Minimal grooming needs</p><p>Can be good with kids and other pets</p><p>Flat face can cause breathing issues (brachycephalic syndrome)</p><p>Prone to eye problems</p><p>Can develop separation anxiety</p>",915

The Birman is color pointed, which means it has a light-colored body with darker ""points"" of color on the face, ears, legs, and tail. The points come in a rainbow of shades, including seal, blue, lilac, chocolate, and red, and may be solid or include subtle tabby or tortoiseshell patterning. Regardless of color, all Birman cats should have four white paws and blue eyes. The Birman cat history is obscure, but it's possible that the breed originated in Burma, where they may have been considered sacred. Today's Birman is cherished as a sweet and affectionate companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>OTHER NAMES: Sacred Cat of Burma.</p><p>PERSONALITY: Gentle, quiet and loving.</p><p>WEIGHT: About 7 to 14 pounds, with males slightly larger.</p><p>LENGTH: About 15 to 18 inches. </p><p>COAT LENGTH: Medium-long to long.

In fact, Birmans are so social that they hate to be alone. It's recommended to bring home two Birman kittens, especially if you work outside the home, so they always have a friend to cuddle and hang out with. Birmans are patient and tolerant cats, making them wonderful playmates for children who handle them gently and with respect. They are playful and inquisitive, and tend to follow you from room to room so they can ""help"" with whatever you happen to be doing. </p><h2>History of the Birman Cat</h2><p>The history of the Birman cat breed is not well known. Although the breed is sometimes referred to as the Sacred Cat of Burma, we don't know for sure if the Birman in fact originated in Burma. It's possible the breed developed in Burma (present day Myanmar), but no documentation exists to support this theory. The Birman cat breed found its way to France and England in the early 1900s, and many of today's Birman cats can trace their origins back to cats from these countries. The Birman cat was eventually brought to the United States, and the Cat Fanciers Association formally recognized the breed in 1967. <br/></p><h2>Birman Cat Care </h2><p>Looking at the Birman's long coat, you might think that the breed requires a lot of grooming. In reality, the coat is quite easy to care for. It is a single coat, so no undercoat to brush out and the texture of the silky coat helps it to resist matting and requires only weekly brushing with a soft slicker brush. Keep your Birman's nails trimmed short and look inside the ears weekly. If you see a small amount of dirt or wax in the ears, use a pet ear cleaner and cotton balls to clean the ears (never use a cotton swab). If your Birman's ears look red or very dirty, schedule an appointment to see your veterinarian.</p><p>Birmans love to follow you all over the house and are always up for a play session. Bring out a few fun toys, such as feather wands, balls that jingle and toy mice to engage your Birman in play sessions a few times a day. Things to climb and perch upon like cat trees, cat-friendly bookshelves and kitty condos also help encourage exercise. Set up a few scratching zones in the house, with vertical scratchers (like tall posts or cat trees) and horizontal scratchers (like cardboard or sisal scratchers that lie flat on the ground).<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Birman cats are an extremely healthy breed, with no known breed-specific diseases or other health concerns. That said, any cat of any age can become sick or injured or develop a health problem. Bring your Birman cat to your veterinarian at least once a year for a complete physical to ensure your cat is healthy and so you can identify any developing health concerns. <br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Birman is a medium-sized cat with an elongated body and A stocky, muscular build. The Birman's head is broad and rounded, with heavy jaws, a firm chin, full cheeks, a somewhat rounded muzzle and a medium-length Roman nose. All Birman kittens are born white; the color points on the face, ears, legs and tail develop later as they mature.<br/><br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because the Birman cat generally has a healthy appetite and has a stocky build, the breed has the potential to become overweight if Birman owners do not properly manage nutrition. Keeping your Birman cat lean is healthier for the cat, and can prevent the development of obesity-related health issues like diabetes and arthritis. Rather than keeping the food bowl filled all day (called free feeding), serve your adult Birman cat two measured meals a day (young kittens should eat multiple times a day). Serving measured meals helps prevent overeating. Ask your veterinarian or breeder for advice about the best food for your Birman cat.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Birman Cat</h2><p>The Birman is somewhat less common than some other cat breeds, but it's still possible to find a reputable breeder with kittens available. The Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association both list active Birman breeders on their respective websites. A fun way to meet Birman breeders and see many different cat breeds in one place is by attending a cat show. To find a local cat show, search the internet for ""cat show near me."" Purbred Birman cats rarely end up in animal shelters, but you can ask local Birman breeders if they know anyone looking to re-home their adult Birman.</p><h2>Breed Overview</h2><p>The Birman cat is an easy-going breed that fits in well into almost any household and family. Medium-sized and sturdily built, they are not too delicate for children to handle. Birmans are sweet and affectionate cats, happy to warm your lap or crawl up onto your chest for a hug. They are generally quiet, vocalizing only when necessary with soft chirruping meows.</p><p>Calm and gentle                                                         <br/></p><p>Affectionate and friendly                                           </p><p>Gets along well with children and other pets</p><p>Sheds moderately</p><p>Prefers an animal companion<br/></p><p>Doesn't do well if left along long periods</p>",1054

The Transylvanian hound, which is known as the Erdelyi Kopó in its native country, is extremely rare, both in its homeland and in the United States. If you're lucky enough to find this breed and bring it into your home, you will be rewarded with a playful, friendly, and loyal companion.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: About 22 to 26 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: At least 55 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, straight, dense, flat double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black with tan markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Courageous, good-natured, determined, loyal, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Transylvania (formerly Hungary, now part of Romania)</p><h2>Characteristics of the Transylvanian Hound</h2><p>Transylvanian hounds are good-natured and quiet, yet also lively. Although they are friendly, the breed may be standoffish with strangers until they get to know them. With their own people, Transylvanian hounds are loving and affectionate, and are great playmates for children in a family. They bond very closely with their owners.</p><h2>History of the Transylvanian Hound</h2><p>A popular hunting dog for Hungarian aristocrats during the Middle Ages, this ancient breed is thought to date as far back as 500 AD. The Transylvanian hound is possibly related to a more common Hungarian hunting dog, the viszla. Over the years, the Transylvanian hound's numbers dwindled and, by the turn of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, the breed was in danger of becoming lost forever. A group of breed fanciers brought the Transylvanian hound back from the brink of extinction in the late 1960s. Originally there were two varieties: long-legged and short-legged. Only the long-legged Transylvanian hound remains.</p><p>In 2015, the Transylvanian hound was recorded in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service (FSS), a step toward eventual full recognition. The breed will be assigned to the Hound Group when it achieves full recognition with the AKC. In 2006, the breed was fully recognized by the United Kennel Club. Internationally, the breed is recognized by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI).  </p><h2>Transylvanian Hound Care</h2><p>Transylvanian hounds are highly intelligent and less stubborn than some other hound breeds. They are also known to be highly active and energetic so you'll want to build an adequate exercise and mental stimulation routine into your dog's day. Happily, the breed has an easy-care short double coat that sheds very little and requires basic grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Transylvanian hounds have plenty of stamina they are reported to cover as many as 100 miles when out hunting. Two vigorous walks a day, each between 30 to 60 minutes, should suffice. Providing ample daily exercise and mental stimulation will mellow out your Transylvanian hound and help it relax for the remainder of the day. In addition to walks, they enjoy unstructured activities like hiking, jogging, and swimming, as well as training for competitive dog sports like agility, tracking, or obedience. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This dog's black-and-tan coat has a shiny appearance and is somewhat coarse to the touch. Brush the coat a few times a week with a soft bristle brush and bathe when dirty. Trim the nails every other week (less often if the dog wears them down naturally when running around outside). Check inside your Transylvanian hound's ears every week, and clean them with a pet-safe ear cleaner if they look dirty. If you see a sign of redness, inflammation, or foul odor coming from the ears, schedule a visit with your veterinarian. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>They learn quickly when you use positive, reward-based training techniques and the right motivation (extra tasty treats work best). Keep training sessions short and always end on a high note when your dog gets something right. Transylvanian hounds can be wary of strangers, but lots of early socialization during puppyhood can keep this from becoming a problem.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While the Transylvanian hound is generally healthy and hardy, hip and elbow dysplasia is sometimes seen in the breed. Responsible breeders perform health screenings on their adult dogs before breeding them to ensure they do not pass on any hereditary issues to their puppies. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>This energetic and athletic breed should do well on a high-quality, calorie-dense diet, but less-active Transylvanian hounds may require diets with fewer calories to avoid weight gain. Excess weight can worsen joint disorders like hip and elbow dysplasia, and can lead to other health conditions like diabetes. If you don't know what diet is best or how much to feed your Transylvanian hound, consult with your breeder or veterinarian. Always feed measured meals twice a day rather than free feeding (leaving food out all day).</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Transylvanian Hound</h2><p>If you have your heart set on a Transylvanian hound puppy, you might have to wait a while. There are few Transylvanian hound breeders in the U.S. Though rarely, an adult Transylvanian hound might find its way into rescue.</p><p>Visit the Transylvanian Hound Club on Facebook or the Erdélyi Kopó Club of Hungary to connect with those who love and support the revitalization of this breed. Since the breed is not fully AKC-accepted as of yet, the cost of a puppy averages between $600 to $800, which is quite low, even for a rare dog.</p><h2>Transylvanian Hound Overview</h2><p>Good family dogs</p><p>Friendly and adventurous</p><p>Good with dogs and other pets</p><p>Very rare and hard to find</p><p>Requires lots of exercise</p><p>Standoffish with strangers </p>",880

They are fairly playful and energetic but not exhausting, and they can be protective but not aggressive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 23 to 26 inches (female), 25 to 27.5 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 70 to 95 pounds (female), 80 to 115 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Thick, medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, rust, and white or black, tan, and white</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 7 to 10 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Gentle, even-tempered, loyal</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Switzerland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bernese Mountain Dog</h2><p>Bernese mountain dogs typically have a good-natured personality. Hallmarks of their temperament include their gentle nature and eagerness to please. With proper socialization, they can be open to meeting strangers and are quite affectionate with their families.</p><h2>History of the Bernese Mountain Dog</h2><p>The Bernese mountain dog originated in Switzerland around the city of Berne, for which it is named. Its ancestors came to the area thousands of years ago and descend from Roman mastiffs, among other dogs. Today, the Berner is one of four varieties of Swiss mountain dog, set apart by its longer and silkier coat. The other three varieties are the Greater Swiss mountain dog, the Entlebucher mountain dog, and the Appenzeller mountain dog.</p><p>In the 1800s, these dogs were used to drive livestock, guard farms, and pull heavy loads. They also were loving companions to their families. The breed declined in popularity toward the end of the 1800s due to machines replacing them in much of their work. However, that spurred clubs to form to preserve the breed and revive its popularity. </p><p>Berners arrived in the U.S. in the early 1900s. And the American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1937. They're now regularly one of the most popular dog breeds in the country. </p><h2>Bernese Mountain Dog Care</h2><p>Bernese mountain dogs require a moderate amount of exercise, along with consistent training and socialization, to be happy and healthy dogs. Their grooming is fairly straightforward, though you should be prepared for lots of loose fur. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Berners have a moderate energy level, and they need space for their big bodies to move and play. Aim for a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise every day, such as brisk walks, hikes, and games of fetch. Berners are quite athletic dogs and can compete in dog sports, such as obedience, agility, tracking, and carting. This will help to challenge them both mentally and physically. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Berner has a double coat (a shorter undercoat paired with a longer outer coat), which repels dirt and debris nicely. But the coat does shed a lot. Brush thoroughly at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent mats and tangles. Also, shedding will typically increase when the weather changes in the spring and fall, and daily brushings might be necessary to keep up with all the loose fur.</p><p>Bathe your dog roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. And check to see whether it needs a nail trim every month as well. Also, examine your dog's ears weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Look for dirt, along with any redness, swelling, or smell in the ears.</p><p>Finally, many Bernese mountain dogs drool very little, but those with loose jowls can drool quite a bit. That slobber can end up on the dog, in the house, and on you. So if you have a drooler, keep a cleanup cloth on hand to prevent the drool from embedding in your dog's fur.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Bernese mountain dogs are bright and eager to please, which helps to make training easy. Start basic obedience and socialization when your dog is a puppy. This is especially important for such a large breed like a Berner, as adults are powerful and thus difficult to control if they haven't learned their manners. Aim to expose your dog to different people, other animals, and various situations to boost its comfort and confidence. </p><p>Berners respond well to consistent and positive training techniques, such as clicker training. They are sensitive to harsh corrections and might shut down with such training.<br/></p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Bernese mountain dogs have relatively short lifespans compared to many other breeds, which is something to take into consideration before deciding to bring one home.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog, and select a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. Berner puppies especially will benefit from a diet made for large breeds. These diets contain the proper nutrition to encourage slow and steady growth to help prevent joint problems and other issues.</p><p>Most owners feed meals twice per day. Discuss the diet and quantity with your vet to ensure your dog is eating properly. And make sure treats and other extra food don't lead to your dog overeating and becoming overweight. Excess weight can put a great deal of stress on these big dogs' joints and lead to other health problems. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bernese Mountain Dog</h2><p>Check local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue organizations for a Berner in need of a home. If you're looking for a breeder puppy, expect to pay around $2,000 to $3,000 on average, though this can vary depending on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Bernese Mountain Dog Overview</h2><p>Excellent family pet</p><p>Loyal and devoted</p><p>Energetic but not exhausting</p><p>Relatively short life span due to hereditary diseases</p><p>Heavy shedder</p><p>Some slobber and drool a lot</p>",906

These dogs have a slender, elegant frame, and they move with agility, grace, and swiftness. They sport large, upright ears and amber eyes that reflect their alert, intelligent nature. Overall, Ibizan hounds, or Beezers as they're sometimes called, tend to be very sweet and even-tempered. They do best with an active owner who can give them plenty of space to stretch their legs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 22.5 to 26 inches (female), 23.5 to 27.5 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 45 pounds (female), 50 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Wiry or smooth short coat</p><p>Coat Color: Red, red and white, or white</p><p>Life Span: 11 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, even-tempered, active</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Spain</p><h2>Characteristics of the Ibizan Hound</h2><p>Ibizan hounds typically have a loving personality with their family, but they can be somewhat reserved when it comes to strangers. A high energy level also helps to shape their temperament, and they need lots of exercise and mental stimulation. They're often good with other dogs, but they might view smaller household pets as prey.</p><h2>History of the Ibizan Hound</h2><p>The Ibizan hound hails from the Balearic Islands; Ibiza is the most well-known of these islands just off the coast of Spain. Ancestors of this breed were Egyptian hounds that Phoenician traders brought to the area roughly 3,000 years ago. The hounds were a help to the local people, who found their sight and speed useful in hunting rabbits and hares on the islands.</p><p>With their long legs and supersonic ears, the dogs were adept at finding and pursuing prey. They became crucial to life in the Balearic Islands, with many people relying on them to catch their next meal. As they were bred and raised in the homes of the islanders, the distinct breed we know today as the Ibizan hound was developed.</p><p>The hounds remained a relatively isolated group of canines for centuries. They were first imported to the United States in 1956. And it wasn't until 1978 that the American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed. It still remains a rare dog breed to this day.</p><h2>Ibizan Hound Care</h2><p>This is an active, athletic breed, so be prepared to provide your dog with ample daily exercise. Fortunately, its grooming needs are relatively easy. Plus, the breed is intelligent and able to pick up on training with ease, though it can be stubborn about obeying.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan on a couple hours or more of exercise per day for an Ibizan hound. These dogs will benefit from long walks, and they make for excellent running and hiking companions. They also can excel in dog sports, including agility and tracking, which can help to burn some of their mental and physical energy. Puzzle toys are another great way to challenge them mentally.</p><p>Just keep in mind that as sighthounds they have a high prey drive. Keep them on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outside, so they don't take off chasing small animals or other perceived prey. In addition, Ibizan hounds have the ability to jump several feet in the air. So make sure any fencing is tall enough to hold them.</p><p>With sufficient exercise, Ibizan hounds are typically calm indoors. Some can even be couch potatoes. But don't let that fool you into thinking all this breed needs is a casual walk around the block. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Ibizan hounds don't shed much, and their coat tends to stay fairly clean. Brush your Ibizan hound weekly to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. </p><p>Moreover, see whether your dog is due for a nail trim once a month or so. And be sure to check its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and other abnormalities. Also, brush its teeth ideally every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socialization from a young age to help prevent bad habits from forming. A puppy class can teach your dog both basic obedience and good manners. Early socialization also can help your Ibizan hound become more open to meeting strangers and other dogs. </p><p>Always use positive training methods, such as treats and praise. Harsh corrections can cause these dogs to shut down and refuse to learn. In addition, keep training sessions fun and varied, as this intelligent breed can become bored easily. And be consistent in your commands. <br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And provide a high-quality dog food with balanced nutrition. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to make sure you're offering the proper amount. But always discuss the quality, feeding schedule, and type of food with your vet. Plus, be mindful of treats and other extra food to prevent overfeeding. And note that these dogs can easily jump on tables and counters to snag food.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Ibizan Hound</h2><p>It can be difficult, but not impossible, to find an Ibizan hound for adoption in North America. Check animal shelters and rescue groups in your area, and see whether you can get your name on a breed wait list. Breeders also can be few and far between. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $800 to $1,500.</p><h2>Ibizan Hound Overview</h2><p>Generally even-tempered</p><p>Great running companion</p><p>Easy to groom and fairly low shedding</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Needs lots of exercise</p><p>Can jump fences</p>",902

Under the poodle's frilly, low-shedding coat is a powerful athlete and an overall wonderful companion. These dogs typically get along with people very well and can be trained in a variety of tasks, including work as service and therapy dogs.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: Up to 10 inches (toy), 10 to 15 inches (miniature), over 15 inches (standard)</p><p>WEIGHT: 4 to 6 pounds (toy), 10 to 15 pounds (miniature), 40 to 70 pounds (standard)</p><p>COAT: Curly, long</p><p>COAT COLOR: Apricot, black, blue, brown, cafe au lait, cream, gray, red, silver, silver beige, or white</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 18 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, affectionate, active</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Iconic and Intelligent Poodle</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Poodle</h2><p>Poodles tend to have a friendly and outgoing personality. High energy and intelligence also influence their temperament, and they prefer to have an active lifestyle. They generally are good around kids and even open to meeting strangers.</p><h2>History of the Poodle</h2><p>Despite being associated with France, poodles can actually trace their origin back to Germany. Going back more than 400 years, Germany had a dog that resembles today's poodle a retriever that was skilled in the water. In fact, the breed's name comes from the German word for puddle.</p><p>The standard poodle is the oldest form of the breed. Hunters used this dog to retrieve waterfowl as well as to be a loving and loyal companion. They gave the poodle its trademark haircut, shaving parts for better range of motion but keeping the hair long around the chest and joints for protection and insulation. </p><p>In the early 20th century, the breed was downsized to the toy poodle and then the miniature, as more people wanted the poodle as a companion and not for hunting. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1887, and it is still one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. today.</p><h2>Poodle Care</h2><p>Poodles require ample daily exercise and mental stimulation to keep them happy and healthy. They also need consistent training and are typically adept at picking up new skills. Plus, their curly coat needs a fair amount of grooming attention.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>All sizes of poodle have a high energy level, along with high mental stimulation needs. They need at least an hour of exercise per day. Brisk walks, jogging, hiking, and swimming all are great options to give them exercise. And as retrievers, they love a game of fetch. Plus, they excel in dog sports, such as agility, which also can challenge them mentally. In addition, classes for service dogs, therapy dogs, and similar activities are a great way to challenge them mentally and physically. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The coarse, curly, low-shedding, single-layer coat of a poodle grows continuously. It needs regular haircuts to keep it looking its best. Most owners keep the coat short for easier maintenance. You can either learn how to trim it at home or take your poodle to a groomer roughly every four to six weeks.</p><p>Regular brushing also is essential, as the hair is retained in the coat rather than being shed. This can lead to matting if you don't brush your poodle fully to the skin. It's best to brush at least two to three times per week, and some owners do so daily.</p><p>Baths and nail trims will be required about every four to six weeks. Also, check your dog's ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning or have any abnormalities. Finally, aim to brush your dog's teeth every day.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Like all dogs, poodles require proper training and socialization to be happy and well-adjusted. Because poodles are extremely smart and eager to please, they can easily be trained to perform a variety of commands and tricks. But they also can learn that they can get away with bad habits if you aren't consistent in your training. So aim to start training when your dog is still a puppy with a basic obedience class.</p><p>Also, start socialization as early as possible by exposing your dog to different people, other dogs, and various settings. Most poodles love people and can even be good in multi-pet households when raised with the other pets. Plus, poodles are generally good around children. However, the smaller toy and miniature poodles might not be a good choice with children who don't know how to treat a dog gently, as they might become injured.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Poodles are a healthy dog breed overall.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your poodle. Most owners feed two measured meals per day of a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. Discuss the type of food and the quantity with your vet, as this can vary depending on age, activity level, and other factors. Make sure to factor treats and other extra food intake into your dog's daily diet to prevent overeating. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Poodle</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and breed-specific rescue groups for a poodle in need of a home.

This dog is bred specifically for its tree hunting skills. The dog will track the scent of an animal and chase it up into a tree to make it easier for the hunter to access. The treeing Tennessee brindle has a loud, baying bark which it uses to alert the hunter that it has successfully found the quarry.</p><h2>History of the Treeing Tennessee Brindle</h2><p>While cur dogs have been around for hundreds of years, the treeing Tennessee brindle was only introduced in the 1960s. The Rev. Earl Phillips wrote a column for a magazine about hunting dogs, which led to meeting owners of brindle cur dogs across the country that, like the Plott hound, were being commended for their hunting abilities. But these smaller brindle dogs specifically showed a particular aptitude for treeing (trapping an animal by forcing it to climb a tree).</p><p>This led to the formation of the Treeing Tennessee Brindle Breeders Association in 1967. A group of passionate brindle cur owners began to selectively breed these dogs to continue honing their treeing skills, color, and size.</p><p>The United Kennel Club recognized the treeing Tennessee brindle in 2017. It has been accepted for recording in the Foundation Stock Service for the American Kennel Club but has not yet been formally registered.</p><h2>Treeing Tennessee Brindle Care</h2><p>A treeing Tennessee brindle does need a decent amount of exercise to satisfy its built-in working drive and energy level. This dog is known for being extremely laid back when in the home environment if it's been given enough exercise. This breed is loyal to a fault and it will enjoy curling up at the feet of its owner on the sofa.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The treeing Tennessee brindle will suit a family that enjoys hiking and spending time in the great outdoors because the breed loves to be active. It's also intelligent and eager to please and known for enjoying competitive dog sports, like agility. Of course, if you want to get involved in scent work trials, the treeing Tennessee brindle would make an excellent partner for this activity.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Other than basic grooming needs, the treeing Tennessee brindle has a short, easy-to-maintain coat that does not shed excessively. The dog will benefit from a good weekly brushing to lift out dead hair and keep the coat healthy. As with all dogs, take care of your dog's dental needs by frequently brushing its teeth to help it avoid dental disease.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The treeing Tennessee brindle is an expert vocalizer. The dog has been bred to alert a hunter that it's trapped its quarry. The dog's tendency to bay and howl can be common in the home environment too. You may need to work on rewarding quiet behavior to ensure this natural tendency doesn't get out of control.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The treeing Tennessee brindle, like many cur dogs, is known for being a hardy and healthy breed. Given that it's a relatively new breed, it is not known for having any particular inheritable health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Treeing Tennessee brindles do tend to be rather food motivated. This can be great for training using positive reinforcement methods, but you have to watch out for over-feeding.</p><p>Obesity is a major health problem in dogs in the United States. It can contribute to a host of serious conditions, but is something that can easily be prevented with a healthy and properly portion-controlled diet.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Treeing Tennessee Brindle</h2><p>The treeing Tennessee brindle breed is still relatively rare.

Despite its size, the dachshund tends to be quite protective and alert, so the breed can also make an excellent watchdog.</p><h2>History of the Dachshund</h2><p>The dachshund originated in Germany as a hunting dog. Though its origins can be traced as far back as the 15th century, the breed's development really began in 17th century Germany. Called , which translates as ""badger dogs,"" these short hounds did just that they hunted badgers. Their stature, determination, and independence were ideal for digging, entering tunnels, and of course, fighting badgers. Their flap-down ears help keep dirt and debris out when burrowing.</p><p>Further development of the breed created two sizes. Historically, the standard size continued to hunt badgers as well as wild boar, while the miniatures pursued hare and foxes. There's also a middle-size dachshund in Germany.</p><p>Dachshunds were brought to the U.S. as early as 1885 when the breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) but increased in popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. To prevent them from being ostracized during World War II, they were temporarily called badger dogs in the U.S. They remain extremely popular dogs to this day.</p><p>Dachshund races, known as ""wiener races,"" are popular in some places for amusement. However, these are opposed by the Dachshund Club of America out of concerns over whether racing might injure the dogs.</p><h2>Dachshund Care</h2><p>Doxies are tenacious, which was good in hunting dogs, but they might annoy you with this trait at home. Dachshunds have a high prey drive, so they may not be a good match for a household that includes pet rodents or other small animals. They usually get along well with other dachshunds but tend to want to be the top dog in a multi-pet household. The propensity to dig may result in damage to your potted plants and yard. Keep that in mind and provide alternative activities for your pet.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Dachshunds are naturally prone to develop obesity. To avoid weight gain, your dachshund should get regular exercise. Daily walks are recommended, with a couple of 10-minute walks per day at the minimum, plus some playtime, such as playing fetch. But proper nutrition is also key and you should be sure to avoid overfeeding.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The grooming needs of the dachshund depend upon their hair coat. The longhaired variety requires daily brushing but does not typically need professional grooming. Smooth dachshunds have a higher shedding rate than other varieties. All dachshunds should receive baths as needed (frequently if skin problems exist).</p><p>Be sure to do regular nail trims in order to prevent problems with the paws. Those flap-down ears also need attention to keep clean and monitor for signs of infection or mites. Maintain good oral hygiene by brushing your dog's teeth a couple of times a week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>While loved for its bold personality, the dachshund may have a tendency to be stubborn, protective, and defensive. Many dachshunds are also known for their tendency to bark. Proper obedience training can turn these potential problems into beneficial qualities.</p><p>Dachshunds can be difficult to housebreak. You will need to be persistent and you may wish to use crate training. Be prepared with puppy pads and cleaning supplies.<br/></p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The amount of food needed will depend on the size of your dog, activity level, age, and other factors. Be sure to provide high-quality food and monitor your dog's intake and weight. Take action early if you notice your dog is getting overweight and talk to your veterinarian about the appropriate feeding schedule, type of food, and amount to keep your dog at a healthy weight. This will help your dog achieve its natural life span.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Dachshund</h2><p>Dachshund puppies are popular so expect to pay between $500 to $1,500 for this dog from a breeder. Keep in mind that if you do find a dachshund that is described as having a rare color or rare markings, such as a ""fawn (Isabella)"" or ""double dappled"" dachshund, it may have health issues. Breeding this dog for looks without considering health issues is unethical and unsafe.

Bulldogs also played a role in the breed's genetic makeup, as boxers are related to nearly all bulldog-type breeds.</p><p>The leaner, smaller boxer spread throughout Europe and then the United States in the late 19th century and 20th century. They unfortunately were involved in inhumane dog fighting and other blood sports. The loyal canines also were used on farms, as guard dogs, as service dogs, and in the police and military. In fact, boxers were one of the first dog breeds to work as police dogs in Germany. </p><p>The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1904, and today boxers are one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S.</p><h2>Boxer Care</h2><p>The athletic boxer has high exercise needs and loves playtime. Proper training also is a must to keep the breed's energy in check. Fortunately, the boxer is relatively low-maintenance when it comes to grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Most boxers have a lot of energy, which means they need ample exercise each day. It's ideal to take your boxer for a 30-minute walk at least twice daily. Jogging, hikes, fetch, and other active play also will help to keep the dog fit and mentally stimulated. Because they are people-oriented dogs, boxers would prefer doing something active with you rather than being left alone in a yard. </p><p>Keep in mind that boxers aren't very tolerant of either cold or hot weather. Their short coat doesn't give them insulation against the cold. And because of their short noses, boxers can't pant well to cool themselves off in heat. So it's best to exercise boxers primarily indoors during extreme weather, hot or cold. In hot weather, plan walks for the coolest time of the day if possible.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because boxers have very short coats, they have relatively simple grooming needs. Brush them weekly with a curry brush to remove any loose fur and debris from their coat. When the weather changes in the spring and fall, except heavier shedding and brush more frequently to compensate for the increase in loose fur.</p><p>The coat also stays fairly clean, requiring a bath only every couple of months or so in general. But keep in mind that many boxers are droolers, so their fur might need some cleanup with a damp cloth around their mouth.</p><p>Nail trims will be necessary roughly every month, depending on how much the dog naturally wears down its nails. Moreover, it's ideal to brush the dog's teeth every day.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Boxers can become hyperactive and unruly if they aren't properly trained and socialized. This is simply a result of their exuberant personalities. Boxers often love to jump up on people a carryover of how the breed would jump while hunting game and ideally they should have consistent training from a young age to curb this behavior. </p><p>It's best to start a boxer puppy in a puppy training class as soon as it meets the age requirement. There, it will learn basic obedience and how to socialize politely with other dogs and people. Expose your boxer to different people and situations, and make sure everyone who meets it uses positive reinforcement on good behaviors. Enrolling in dog sports, service dog courses, or similar classes also can help your dog work on its obedience and strengthen the bond you have with it.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>In addition to their intolerance to extreme temperatures, boxers also are prone to some common health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed a quality, nutritionally balanced dog food, and always provide clean water. Follow your vet's instructions for the quantity and variety of food, as this can vary with age, activity level, and other factors. Regularly monitor your boxer's weight to prevent obesity and other health issues.</p><p>Furthermore, like other deep-chested dogs, boxers can be prone to bloat, which can lead to the stomach dangerously twisting on itself. Eating from an elevated bowl, eating slowly, and being fed smaller meals can help to prevent bloat. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Boxer</h2><p>Check out local animal shelters and breed rescue groups to find a boxer in need of a home. Because the breed is so popular, boxers are relatively easy to find. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $2,000 on average, though this can vary widely depending on bloodline and other factors. </p><p><br/></p><h2>Boxer Overview</h2><p>Affectionate</p><p>Fun-loving</p><p>Good family dogs</p><p>Excessive drool with some</p><p>Can be hyperactive without training and exercise</p><p>Can't tolerate hot or cold weather well</p>",924

Its ears are small and pointed, and its eyes also are small with a triangular shape. Overall, these dogs have a solid, muscular build. They tend to be quite entertaining and energetic companions goofy and stubborn, at times. They're often called a ""kid in a dog suit.""</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 21 to 22 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 50 to 70 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Nearly any color, including white, red, fawn, black, blue, or brindle</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, lively, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bull Terrier</h2><p>The bull terrier generally has a friendly and comical personality. It tends to get along with people well but doesn't always like other dogs. A high energy level and love of playtime also shape the bull terrier's temperament.</p><h2>History of the Bull Terrier</h2><p>Inhumane bloodsports involving animals became popular in Britain around the 13th century. In particular, a sport known as bull-baiting involved a bulldog fighting a tethered bull as people bet on the results. </p><p>Britain banned such bloodsports in the 1800s. But some people took them underground instead. Rather than bull-baiting, which was too conspicuous, they focused on dogfighting. And they wanted more fiery and nimble dogs, so they crossed their bulldogs with various terriers. Several breeds arose from this, including the bull terrier. </p><p>As dogfighting diminished toward the mid-1800s, breeders worked to refine the bull terrier to make it more of a companion dog. They bred for a sweeter temperament and less rugged appearance. It would still take several more decades before the dog acquired its trademark curved head. </p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1885. And there have been several notable bull terriers throughout history. President Theodore Roosevelt owned a bull terrier. And bull terriers have helped to market both Bud Light beer (Spuds MacKenzie) and Target (Bullseye). </p><h2>Bull Terrier Care</h2><p>Bull terriers should get a fair amount of exercise each day, and they require minimal grooming. It's also important to provide training and socialization starting at a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Provide at least one to two hours of exercise per day for your bull terrier to help burn its high levels of mental and physical energy. Multiple walks per day are ideal, along with jogs, hikes, games of fetch, and other play. Puzzle toys can help to challenge your dog mentally as well. Plus, dog sports, such as agility and tracking, can provide both mental and physical stimulation. </p><p>Always keep your bull terrier on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outside, as not all bull terriers will be friendly if they encounter a strange dog. Likewise, the bull terrier's short coat doesn't offer much protection in cold weather. So limit outdoor exercise sessions in the cold, and consider providing your dog with a coat or sweater.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The extremely short, smooth coat of the bull terrier requires little maintenance. Only basic grooming is necessary. Plan to brush weekly with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Your dog might have higher periods of shedding, often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to brush more frequently to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Give your dog a bath every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. And check its nails monthly as well to see whether they need a trim. Also, look in its ears at least every week for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. And aim to brush its teeth every day.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Proper obedience training and socialization are essential to manage your bull terrier. And it's important to start them young to prevent bad habits from forming. Bull terriers can be stubborn when it comes to training. Always use positive reinforcement methods. They tend to respond best when training sessions feel like a game rather than work. </p><p>Moreover, aim to socialize your dog with different people and other dogs from a young age to boost its comfort and confidence. Positive experiences can go a long way to ensuring that your bull terrier is well-mannered. But some bull terriers have a difficult time being comfortable around other dogs, especially unfamiliar dogs, largely due to the breed's fighting history. And consequently there is the potential for aggression.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Bull terriers live generally healthy lives, but they are prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Make sure fresh water is always available to your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. In particular, it's important for bull terriers to receive adequate calcium to support their bone development, especially when they are puppies. It's common to feed two measured meals per day to prevent overfeeding. But you should always run both the type of diet and the amount by your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bull Terrier</h2><p>Bull terriers are a fairly popular dog breed. So be sure to check local animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home if you're looking to acquire a bull terrier. If you want a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $500 to $3,500, though this can vary widely.</p><h2>Bull Terrier Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and playful</p><p>Basic grooming needs</p><p>Can be good for families with older children</p><p>Not always friendly with other dogs</p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p><p>Requires rigorous daily exercise</p>",894

These affectionate and intelligent kitties may descend from an ancient breed in Myanmar (formerly Burma), but they were officially bred in the United States in the 1930s.</p><p>This breed is vulnerable to a genetic skeletal disorder, but it can be ruled out with a simple DNA test, so you should be able to buy or adopt one with confidence in its health. A Burmese will likely get along with everyone in a family, including friendly dogs, so it makes a charming addition to just about any household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Friendly, affectionate, sociable with other animals, playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 14 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Sable, champagne, platinum, blue, and variations of each</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid</p><p>Eye Color: Gold</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 18 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States (but likely dates back to ancient Burma)</p><h2>Burmese Characteristics</h2><p>The Burmese cat is a character, full of energy and playful whims. Its kitten-like personality persists into adulthood, and it has also been described as being almost dog-like in its devotion to its human family.</p><p>When the Burmese isn't playing, it is probably following its owner around or cuddling for a nap. Females are more likely to be actively in charge of a household, while males supervise from the comfort of a lap. Both sexes have soft, sweet voices and enjoy ""conversing"" with people. </p><h2>History of the Burmese</h2><p>In Myanmar (formerly called Burma), legend has it that cats of this breed were viewed as sacred and celebrated in temples and monasteries. All sources agree that the ""founding mother"" of the Burmese breed was Wong Mau, a cat who was brought to America from Burma by a sailor in 1930 and given to Dr. Joseph G. Thompson of San Francisco.</p><p>Wong Mau was purportedly walnut brown with darker points, having a more compact body and shorter tail than a Siamese. Her unique appearance led Dr. Thompson to engage in a breeding program, pairing Wong Mau with Tai Mau, a seal point Siamese.</p><p>Some of the kittens more closely resembled the Siamese breed, while some looked more Burmese. Wong Mau was then bred to one of her sons, and the kittens were varying shades of brown, The darkest brown offspring became the foundation of the Burmese breed.</p><p>The Burmese and European Burmese are the two types of this breed recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association. The Governing Council of the Cat Fancy, which sets standards for cats in the UK, recognized the Burmese in 1952. The International Cat Association, an organization at the forefront of keeping genetic registries for cats, accepted the breed in 1979.</p><h2>Burmese Care</h2><p>Burmese cats' coats are short and fine with a glossy, silky shine. They require minimal grooming and do not shed much. Grooming your cat with a rubber brush once a week should be enough to rid the coat of dead hairs and keep it looking lustrous.</p><p>It is also important to keep your cat active. Burmese are playful and energetic and do best in active homes with families that are willing to play and interact with their pets. These cats are highly trainable and enjoy interactive challenges.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Burmese are generally healthy, but the breed carries an inherited disease called familial episodic hypokalemic polymyopathy, which causes skeletal muscle weakness. There is a simple DNA test to check a cat for this disorder, and responsible breeders should offer documentation showing their cats are free of the offending gene.</p><p>Cats affected with hypokalemic polymyopathy experience episodic issues that may affect the whole animal or may be localized to the neck or limb muscles, making it difficult to walk or hold their heads correctly.</p><p>Again, reputable breeders test their cats for these diseases and offer a health guarantee as part of the sale of their kittens. It is always wise to buy from a breeder who provides a written health guarantee.<br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The colors of Burmese cats vary considerably, and different colors are approved by the major cat associations, making the Burmese standard one of the more complex among pure breeds.</p><p>Each association has specific standards for other Burmese characteristics, but they generally agree on the anatomy of the ideal breed representative. Overall, the cat's head should be rounded and have full eyes that are round and spaced well. There should also be a visible nose break and well-spaced ears. A medium-sized, muscular, and compact body is preferred with proportionate legs and rounded paws. The tail should be straight and medium in length.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>To keep up with their active lifestyle, these cats need plenty of protein and nutrients. It is always best to discuss diet options with your vet to ensure all of your cat's needs are being met. High-quality dry food helps maintain good oral health and can be supplemented with wet food for added hydration.</p><p>To prevent your cat from becoming a picky eater, the National Alliance of Burmese Breeders suggests that it is important to switch brands of cat food now and then so your feline friend does not become accustomed to just one kind.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Burmese Cat</h2><p>Search for a pure-breed Burmese cat by contacting veterinarians and breeders in your area. If you need to explore a larger area of possibility, check for breeders via the National Alliance of Burmese Breeders.</p><p>While it's rare that a purebred Burmese ends up in a shelter, it may happen, and Petfinder is a great site for helping locate a particular breed or something close to it across the nation.<br/></p><h2>Burmese Overview</h2><p>Burmese are compatible with other pets and children. They are athletic, playful, and happiest in an active household. These cats yearn for attention from humans and can become upset if separated for long. Burmese develop strong attachments to their owners, and while they may need a couple of weeks to adjust to their new home, these deep bonds develop relatively quickly. To keep your Burmese happy, make sure it always has a companion, whether it's a human or another pet.</p><p>Attentive and loyal</p><p>Generally long lifespan</p><p>Enjoys other cats or dogs and gentle children</p><p>High risk for an inherited muscular disorder</p><p>Can get depressed if left alone for long</p><p>Tendency to be demanding or bossy</p>",1028

It's among the tallest of all dog breeds, and it's also an athletic, affectionate, and loyal companion. The deerhound is long and lean with a physique much like that of a greyhound.</p><p>The breed dates back to the 16th century and is known as the ""Royal Dog of Scotland."" It was once described by 18th-century famed Scottish author and historian Sir Walter Scott as ""the most perfect creature of heaven."" Deerhound enthusiasts can tell you how rewarding it is to have one of these dogs. With their playfulness and gentle dispositions, they can make delightful family pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 30 to 32 inches (males); 28 inches and up (females)</p><p>WEIGHT: 85 to 110 pounds (males); 75 to 95 pounds (females)</p><p>COAT: Wiry</p><p>COAT COLOR: Varying shades of gray, fawn, or brindle</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 8 to 11 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Dignified, docile, gentle, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Scotland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Scottish Deerhound</h2><p>Scottish deerhounds are very loyal and extremely affectionate with their families and typically prefer not to be left alone. They are rarely aggressive and respond well to strangers. This is definitely not a guard dog.</p><h2>History of the Scottish Deerhound</h2><p>The Scottish deerhound is a native of Scotland and can be traced back to the 16th century. The breed is believed to have existed prior to the 16th century but went by a variety of different names, including the Irish wolf dog, Scotch greyhound, rough greyhound, and Highland deerhound. Ultimately, the breed was named for its skillful ability to hunt deer.</p><p>The Scottish deerhound has been highly valued for its skill and beauty. In fact, during the Age of Chivalry, no one of rank lower than an earl was permitted to possess a deerhound. Despite its value, the breed faced near-extinction in the mid to late 18th century with the collapse of the Scottish nobility after the battle of Culloden and the Jacobite rebellion but was saved by enthusiasts Archibald and Duncan McNeill. They also became rare again after World War I due to the breakup of large estates.</p><p>The Scottish deerhound arrived in the United States towards the end of the 19th century and was admitted to the American Kennel Club (AKC) Hound group in 1886. Today, the deerhound remains a relatively rare breed of high value.</p><h2>Scottish Deerhound Care</h2><p>Like other sighthounds, the deerhound is easily stimulated by visual prey because of its high prey drive. Cats and other small animals may provoke their predatory instinct until they learn the animal is a family member. Raising your deerhound around small pets can help teach the dog that they are not prey. However, you might never feel comfortable leaving your deerhound unsupervised around small pets. They enjoy the company of other large dogs, especially another deerhound.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Though Scottish deerhounds are excellent athletes, they can also become lazy as adults. They love to run and play outdoors but might loaf around when indoors. However, daily exercise of at least two full hours is essential to keep your deerhound motivated and fit. Besides walks, try hiking, jogging, cycling, tug-of-war, and endless games of fetch to wear your deerhound out.</p><p>You will need to walk your deerhound on a leash as this breed will chase anything that moves. This can also be a challenge as they will bolt when on a leash and could yank you off your feet due to their size.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Scottish deerhound has a harsh and wiry coat that is 3 to 4 inches long and requires only basic grooming. A weekly once-over with a slicker brush and/or comb should be sufficient to keep the deerhound's coat looking its best. The breed sheds at a fairly low rate, and even less with regular brushing. Your deerhound should only need occasional bathing as necessary based on odor or a dirty coat.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Proper training and socialization are important for deerhounds. Fortunately, they tend to learn well. This is an intelligent breed but often has a short attention span. In training, it is important to discover what motivates your deerhound, as this can be a challenge for some.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Deerhounds need about three to four cups of dry food each day, which should be divided into two meals. They are prone to bloating and if they gulp their food or eat too much at one time, they risk this condition. When a bloated stomach becomes twisted, it is a medical emergency.</p><p>Monitor your dog's weight to prevent obesity. A dog's needs will change as it ages and you should discuss appropriate feeding schedules, amount of food, type of food, and exercise with your veterinarian.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Scottish Deerhound</h2><p>A Scottish deerhound may be tough to find, so locating a puppy or rescue may take some time. If you find a breeder, expect to pay between $1,000 to $2,500 for a puppy depending on its lineage.</p><h2>Scottish Deerhound Overview</h2><p>Gentle and playful</p><p>Affectionate</p><p>Friendly</p><p>Tends to pull or bolt very hard when on a leash</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Tends to become lazy</p>",861

Spitz breeds, also called Northern breeds, are a type of dog commonly found in cold and snowy regions. Like most spitz breeds, the Japanese spitz has a thick double coat, a wedge-shaped head, upright triangular ears, and a long tail that curls up and over the back. </p><p>The friendly and fun-loving Japanese spitz is the consummate family dog. Cheerful, quiet, and clean, they are ideal house dogs, which is a good thing because there is nothing they want more than to be inside with their families. The Japanese spitz's small size and moderate energy level make it an ideal apartment dog. Most Japanese spitz get along great with other dogs, cats, and respectful children. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Weight: 10 to 25 pounds</p><p>Height: 12 to 15 inches tall at the shoulder</p><p>Coat: A straight and stand-off outer coat paired with a short, soft, dense undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Pure white</p><p>Lifespan: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Playful</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Japan</p><p><br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Japanese Spitz</h2><p>Japanese spitz are happy, little dogs that make wonderful companions, especially for your kids! They have a gentle temperament, are easy to train, and are perfectly content in a smaller home or apartment.</p><p>These fluffy friends are smart and a great deal of fun. Please note: these small dogs have a louder bark than you'd imagine, so don't be startled when you hear it.</p><h2>History of the Japanese Spitz</h2><p>The Japanese spitz was developed in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s by crossbreeding other spitz-type dogs that were imported from various locations, including Australia, Canada, China, Siberia, and the United States. After several decades of crossbreeding the various spitz breeds, a small, fluffy, white spitz breed was recognized in 1948 and called the Japanese spitz. Although records of the specific breeding program were kept, they were destroyed during World War II, so the exact details are unknown. The breeds thought to be used for the development of the Japanese spitz include white German spitz, klein wolfsspitz (also known as the Keeshond), and various miscellaneous white spitz-type breeds.  </p><p>In the United States, the Japanese spitz is recognized by the United Kennel Club, where it is part of the Northern Breeds group. The Japanese spitz is also part of the Foundation Stock Service in the American Kennel Club, which is the first step toward eventual full recognition. The breed is also recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club (Non-Sporting Dogs group), the Japan Kennel Club, and the international kennel club Fédération Cynologique International.</p><h2>Japanese Spitz Care</h2><p>The Japanese spitz's thick, fluffy, luxurious white coat is surprisingly easy to care for. No trimming is required and the dog tends to look and feel clean with only occasional baths, as the hair naturally repels dirt.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Although Japanese spitz have plenty of energy, they don't need huge amounts of exercise. A Japanese spitz enjoys daily walks, so couple these with some play sessions in the backyard, and your dog will be happy. If you live in an apartment, it's especially important to get your Japanese spitz out of the house for walks and exploration. The Japanese spitz's small size makes it very portable, and they love to accompany their people on excursions outside the house.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Twice a year, the Japanese spitz experiences a seasonal heavy shed, losing much of its undercoat over the course of a few weeks. Often called blowing coat, some extra brushing is needed during this time to cut down on how much hair ends up on your furniture and clothing. However, the rest of the year, the Japanese spitz sheds less than you might think and requires only weekly brushing. Keep its nails short by trimming them weekly or every other week. Inspect your Japanese spitz's ears weekly and clean with a pet ear cleaner when they look dirty. It is also good to pay attention to dental hygiene and brush your dog's teeth two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Japanese spitz is very smart, and this breed wants to please, so they can be easy to train as long as you find the right motivation. Some Japanese spitz might do anything for a tasty treat; others might be more motivated by their favorite toy. Keep training sessions short and sweet, always ending on a positive note. It's important to start socializing your spitz early in puppyhood to avoid excessive shyness and nervousness about new people, places, and things. Although they are small, resist the urge to baby your dog and carry it everywhere let it walk on its own four paws and experience the world up close and personal. This will allow your spitz to develop the confidence needed to be a well-adjusted adult dog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Japanese spitz is an extremely healthy breed with a long lifespan. Reputable breeders have their adult Japanese spitz evaluated for luxating patellas to avoid passing on this issue, which is known to occasionally appear in the breed. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your Japanese spitz a high-quality dog food (ask your breeder or veterinarian for a recommendation) and be sure to portion out meals with a measuring cup or scale to avoid overfeeding. Free feeding (leaving food out all day) can lead to weight gain; feeding scheduled meals twice a day is healthier. Being overweight can exacerbate joint issues, and lead to other health problems like diabetes. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Japanese Spitz</h2><p>The Japanese spitz is a rare breed in North America. Some adults might find their way into rescue, but usually, people wanting to bring home a Japanese spitz will be buying a puppy from a reputable breeder. The Japanese Spitz Club of the USA publishes a directory of breeders on its website. Be prepared to get on a waiting list, as there aren't many Japanese spitz breeders in North America.</p><h2>Dog Breed Overview</h2><p>Good apartment dog</p><p>Clean, easy-care coat</p><p>Friendly with people and pets</p><p>May be wary of strangers</p><p>Some may be problem barkers</p><p>Doesn't do well alone</p>",989

This is a big-boned, muscular dog breed that stands quite tall. Yet it still can move with good agility. Black Russian terriers were bred to have both brains and brawn as a working dog. They've been used for police and military work and have a strong protective nature. They need firm, consistent leadership and might not be ideal for a novice dog owner due to their size and smarts.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 26 to 29 inches (female), 27 to 30 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 80 to 130 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium to long, curly double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, courageous, calm</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Russia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Black Russian Terrier</h2><p>Black Russian terriers generally have a calm and collected temperament. High intelligence and the ability to learn different tasks also contribute to their personality. They are typically quite loyal to their family but can be wary of strangers.</p><h2>History of the Black Russian Terrier</h2><p>The black Russian terrier can trace its origin back to the 1930s. The Soviet government set up the Red Star Kennel near Moscow where scientists and breeders worked to create the ultimate working dog that the Soviet army could use. They combined several breeds, including the giant schnauzer, Airedale terrier, Rottweiler, and Newfoundland. After World War II, breeds brought back from Germany were added to the mix as well. </p><p>Eventually, the black Russian terrier took shape. It could patrol borders and prisons for the military, and its thick coat allowed it to work in the harsh climate. </p><p>In the 1950s, the breed became more popular in Russia as a companion animal, guarding personal property and being loyal to its family. The Soviet Ministry of Agriculture first officially recognized the breed in 1981. And the American Kennel Club added it in 2004.</p><h2>Black Russian Terrier Care</h2><p>Black Russian terriers don't need a great deal of daily exercise. But early and consistent training and socialization are absolutely essential. Their grooming needs also are somewhat involved.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite its large size, the black Russian terrier only needs about 30 to 60 minutes of exercise per day at minimum. These dogs like going for walks, jogging, swimming, and hiking. And they enjoy an exuberant game of fetch, as well as puzzle toys. Plus, dog sports, such as agility and rally, can exercise both their bodies and their minds.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Thoroughly brush your black Russian terrier at least once or twice a week to prevent tangles and mats from forming in the dense coat. A brushing session can take at least a half hour on this big dog, but it's critical to keep its coat and skin healthy. You'll also have to periodically trim around the beard and eyebrows to keep them tidy. Many owners opt for a professional grooming every couple of months or so.</p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. And check its nails monthly to see whether they're due for a trim. Also, look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and irritation. And brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socialization with your black Russian terrier from as young of an age as possible. This is critical to prevent its protective instinct from developing into aggression. These dogs also tend to be dominating, so you must counter that with consistent and firm commands. Always use positive training methods, not negative corrections. Black Russian terriers are highly intelligent and will learn quickly as long as you are kind and steadfast with your expectations. </p><p>In terms of socialization, aim to expose your dog to different people and various locations early and often to boost its comfort level. This breed generally does fairly well with other dogs, especially when socialized at a young age. But there is potential for aggression with unfamiliar dogs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water out for your dog. And feed a high-quality canine diet that's nutritionally balanced. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But you always should discuss both the type of food and the quantity with your vet.</p><p>Make sure to monitor treats and other extra food to prevent your dog from overeating. Keep in mind the size of this breed. It might be able to swipe food off a table or counter, so take measures to prevent it from getting items it shouldn't have.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Black Russian Terrier</h2><p>Black Russian terriers are a rare dog breed, so it might take some time and effort to find one. It's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups; ask whether they have a breed wait list that you can get your name on.</p><p>If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $2,000 to $4,000 on average, though this can vary widely depending on bloodline and other factors. You also might have to wait for a puppy to become available and potentially travel a good distance to get it, depending on where you live.</p><h2>Black Russian Terrier Overview</h2><p>Loyal and affectionate with family</p><p>Generally calm demeanor</p><p>Good watchdog</p><p>Can be prone to aggressive behavior</p><p>Requires plenty of training and socialization</p><p>Somewhat involved grooming needs</p>",875

This hybrid cat breed is growing in popularity due to its pattern and personality, and it stays about the same size as a large domestic house cat. They were developed by breeding an Asian leopard cat ()with domestic cats like the Abyssinian, Egyptian Mau, or American shorthair.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, energetic, animated</p><p>Weight: Up to 20 pounds but generally about 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair, Long hair (variant)</p><p>Coat Colors: Brown tabby, seal sepia tabby, seal mink tabby, seal lynx point, black silver tabby, seal silver sepia tabby, seal silver mink tabby, and seal silver lynx point</p><p>Coat Patterns: Spotted or marbled </p><p>Eye Color: Green or gold</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Beautiful Bengal Cat</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Bengal Cat</h2><p>Although the Bengal cat is wonderfully wild-looking, it doesn't usually grow much bigger than a hunky house cat (about 12 pounds) and is full-grown in about a year. This cat has a personality that is as appealing as its appearance. The Bengal is affectionate, playful, and can get along with people of all ages as well as other pets. It is an energetic cat and likes room to play.</p><h2>History of the Bengal Cat</h2><p>While there were previous attempts at breeding African leopard cats and domestic cats, the Bengal cat hybrid is credited to Jean Sudgen Mill in the 1970s. She acquired hybrids from Dr. Willard Centerwall who was breeding them at Loyola University to study their genetics. She bred the hybrids with domestic cats to produce a breed that had the personality of a domestic cat and an exotic look. Greg and Elizabeth Kent crossed African leopard cats with Egyptian Maus to develop a line of Bengal cats as well.</p><p>Hybrids are denoted by the generations they are away from their wild ancestry, with F1 denoting the first generation, which has one African leopard cat (ALC) parent. F2 has one ALC grandparent, and F3 has one ALC great-grandparent. It is thought that by F3 the cats have the temperaments of domestic cats. To be shown, the International Cat Association (TICA) accepts only cats of F4 or more generations removed from having an ALC ancestor. Today, most Bengal cats are bred from other Bengal cats.<br/></p><p>Bengal cats were first recognized as an experimental breed by TICA in 1983 and received full recognition in 1993. The Bengal cat gained breed recognition by the Cat Fancier's Association in 2016. They are also recognized for registration by the American Cat Fanciers Association, the Canadian Cat Association, the United Feline Organizations, and the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy.</p><h2>Bengal Cat Care</h2><p>As most Bengal cats today are several generations removed from the African leopard cat, they require no special care. They are simply large house cats. You can groom your cat weekly to remove dead hair and help prevent hairballs. Trim your cat's nails every couple of weeks, and make sure your cat's litter box is clean daily.</p><p>Bengal cats are active and like to jump, so you should provide a climbing tree and opportunities for your cat to find a perch to survey the room. Provide interactive toys to engage your cat. Spend time playing together; you can train your cat to fetch and catch the laser dot.</p><p>Bengal cats love water, a trait that most house cats do not possess. You may have to be careful that your aquarium does not become a fishing pond. You might even offer a small backyard pool for water play if your yard is secure enough to prevent escape.</p><p>As with any cat, a Bengal cat is best kept as an indoors-only cat. That protects them from catching diseases from other animals, getting into fights, being attacked by predators, or being hit by vehicles.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Your Bengal cat will need all of the same immunizations and preventative health treatments as a domestic cat. They are not immune to feline leukemia virus (FeLV) like their ALC ancestor. Purebred cat breeds are more prone to genetic diseases than mixed-breed domestic cats because their gene pool is smaller.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Bengals are best-loved for their wild-looking markings. Rosettes, marbling, spots, and stripes make up the leopard patterns that varying Bengals display, but their official markings are only spotted or marbled. The patterns are always outlined in black, chocolate, or grey/silver.</p><p>The coat colors are called brown tabby (most common), seal sepia tabby, seal mink tabby, seal lynx point, black silver tabby, seal silver sepia tabby, seal silver mink tabby, and seal silver lynx point. All shades of brown to black make up the markings and the brown tabbies typically have white background fur on their whisker pads, chin, chest, abdomen, and inner legs.</p><p>Most Bengals are short-haired, but there is a long-haired variant. They are not considered hypoallergenic. Their eyes are green or gold.</p><p>Bengals are large, muscular cats with long faces and large ears.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Bengals eat what other house cats eat cat food. But, this generalization can be tricky. Many owners prefer to feed a grain-free diet or raw diet to their Bengals, especially if they are within the first three generations. For most Bengal owners, purchasing a formulated, grain-free diet is the most practical way to feed their cats.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bengal Cat</h2><h2>Bengal Cat Overview</h2><p>Bengal cats make perfect pets for families looking for unusual, affectionate playmates that aren't wild. They are big, sturdy cats that enjoy jumping and climbing, so cat trees (and patience) are a must.

These dogs were bred to hunt wild boars and prized as devoted companions. The Shikoku is rare, even in its home country, but more so in North America.</p><p>All Shikoku should have distinctive markings. Called urajiro, these white or light-colored patches appear on the sides of the muzzle, cheeks, brow of the eye, under the jaw and neck, on the chest and belly, the underside of the tail, and on the insides of the legs. Although it resembles a larger version of the more common Shiba Inu, the Shikoku is generally calmer, less stubborn, more obedient, and more submissive than the Shiba. This breed is best for experienced owners, as Shikoku dogs require consistent training and have protective tendencies.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Spitz and primitive type (FCI)</p><p>Height: 17 to 22 inches tall</p><p>Weight: 35 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Harsh, straight outer coat combined with a soft, dense undercoat</p><p>Coat Color: Sesame, red sesame, and black sesame</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, courageous, protective, calm, athletic, loyal</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Japan</p><h2>Characteristics of the Shikoku</h2><p>The ancient Shikoku is what is known as a primitive breed, which means they retain more wild characteristics than other domesticated dogs that have grown accustomed to living with humans over the centuries. Because of their nature, your Shikoku's temperament around others will vary considerably depending on socialization in puppyhood. They are calm, reserved, and loyal to their owners, but typically are not suitable for homes with other pets or young children.</p><h2>History of the Shikoku</h2><p>The Shikoku was developed in the mountainous regions on the island of Shikoku in Japan. Though bred loosely, three breed varieties appeared on different parts of the island. These varieties took names from where they were bred: Awa, Hongawa, and Hata. It is said that the Hongawa variety was considered the purest and most desirable due to the difficulty in accessing the Hongawa region. Today, the Shikoku is a single breed with no varieties. Japan designated the breed a natural monument in 1937. </p><p>The Shikoku is not recognized by the American Kennel Club, but the breed is part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service, which is a stepping stone toward eventual full registration. In North America, the Shikoku is recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club and the United Kennel Club. Internationally, the breed is recognized by the Japan Kennel Club and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale (FCI), the world's largest international federation of clubs. </p><p><h2>Shikoku Care</h2><p>Shikoku dogs require substantial exercise, grooming, and training, and they should be raised by experienced owners. It's important that those adopting this breed are ready and able to dedicate plenty of time to their care.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Shikoku is a hunting dog with lots of energy to burn. Owners must commit to providing abundant daily exercise and mental stimulation; this breed is especially well-suited to sole owners who spend much of their time outdoors. Try long walks, hiking and exploring, and tossing a toy or ball, but always keep your Shikoku on a leash or in a safely enclosed place like your backyard. Bred to hunt for centuries, the Shikoku simply cannot be trusted off-leash as it may go after dogs, cats, squirrels, or other animals, paying no heed to its owner's pleas to stop. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><h3>Training</h3><p>Although the Shikoku is intelligent and fairly obedient toward its owner, the breed is still primitive. It is somewhat willful and independent, so training can be a challenge. Train daily using positive techniques and rewards, and always be a fair and consistent leader. </p><p>The Shikoku has a high prey drive (the instinct to chase and kill small animals) and can be territorial or aggressive toward dogs and other animals. However, if raised together, the Shikoku may be able to live peacefully with another family pet. These dogs are reserved and aloof with strangers, so early, frequent socialization in puppyhood is vital to curb overprotectiveness.</p><p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Shikoku is considered a healthy breed. However, like all purebred dogs, this breed can develop certain genetically linked health conditions. Responsible breeders test their adult Shikoku prior to breeding them to ensure they don't pass on undesirable medical problems.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all dog breeds, Shikoku should eat high-quality dog food in appropriate amounts so as to avoid becoming overweight or obese. Too much weight can contribute to the development of joint disorders like hip dysplasia, knee dysplasia, and arthritis. Obesity can also lead to other serious health problems such as diabetes. Consult your veterinarian about your dog's specific needs to determine a healthy diet and portion schedule.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Shikoku</h2><p>The Shikoku is extremely rare outside of Japan. It may be exceedingly difficult to find a breeder, especially in North America. These dogs are also uncommon in shelters. While this breed is not registered in the U.S., the American Kennel Club maintains a list of breeders for all dogs (including those like the Shikoku that are not yet fully recognized but are part of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service).</p><h2>Shikoku Overview</h2><p>Beautiful, low-maintenance coat</p><p>Active and energetic companion</p><p>Docile and obedient with its owner</p><p>High prey drive, not safe off leash</p><p>Territorial and may be aggressive with animals</p><p>Requires abundant exercise, socialization, and training</p>",866

Shelties look like a miniature version of the rough collie. They have upright ears that slightly bend over, an alert expression, a low tail, and an agile build. Bred to herd livestock, Shelties are quite intelligent and athletic. They also can be very loving and loyal companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 13 to 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 25 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long double coat<br/></p><p>Coat Color: Black and white; black, white, and tan; blue merle and white; blue merle, white, and tan; sable and white; or sable, merle, and tan</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Energetic, intelligent, playful</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Scotland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Shetland Sheepdog</h2><p>Shelties generally have a bright and alert temperament. They tend to be quite in tune with their surroundings. A high energy level and love of play also help to shape their personality. They love being active with their family but can be wary of strangers.</p><h2>History of the Shetland Sheepdog</h2><p>Although these dogs might remind you of the famous TV collie, Lassie, the Shetland sheepdog is not actually a direct descendant of the collie unlike some miniaturized versions of larger breeds. Instead, it is more closely related to the Scottish collie and King Charles spaniel.</p><p>The actual origin of the Sheltie is unclear. But it's likely that local dogs of Scotland's Shetland Islands were mixed with collies and other dogs that arrived from the mainland. The result was a dog with a thick coat that could withstand the harsh climate. And its small size was a valued trait because that meant it ate less than larger herding dogs. </p><p>Shelties started to gain popularity outside of their native home in the early 20th century. They were first called the Shetland collie. But after disagreement from collie breeders, they were rebranded as Shetland sheepdogs. The Kennel Club of England first recognized the breed in 1909, followed by the American Kennel Club in 1911.</p><h2>Shetland Sheepdog Care</h2><p>Plan on lots of exercise and mental stimulation for a Sheltie. Also, expect to spend some time each week grooming its long coat. And aim to start training and socialization from an early age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Shelties should receive at least one to two hours per day of exercise. Long walks, jogging, hiking, and active games of fetch all are ideal ways to help them burn energy. And puzzle toys can challenge their intelligent minds. Shelties also excel in dog sports, including agility and herding. And they take well to training as therapy and service dogs.</p><p>Just be aware that their herding instinct can cause them to chase moving objects, including cars, if you let them off leash outside. It's best to keep them on leash or in a securely fenced area.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your Sheltie's long, thick coat at least a few times a week to remove loose fur and prevent mats. Pay special attention to the fur around the legs and tail, as well as behind the ears, as it can easily get matted. Expect periods of higher shedding seasonally, often in the spring and fall. Increase how often you brush to keep up with the loose fur. Avoid shaving a Sheltie's coat, as it insulates the dog from both hot and cold weather and protects it from sunburn.</p><p>Plan on a bath roughly once every one to two months, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Check your dog's nails every month or so to see whether they need a trim. And look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. Also, try to brush your dog's teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your Sheltie ideally when it's a puppy. Shelties generally are very smart and eager to please, making them adept at obedience training. Always use positive training methods. Shelties can be sensitive to your tone, and harsh corrections can cause them to shut down. </p><p>Aim to provide your Sheltie with positive experiences around different people and other dogs. This can help to diffuse the breed's natural wariness of strangers. Also, work on teaching this vocal breed to stop barking on command. Shelties not only tend to bark at perceived threats but also to express their emotions and even out of boredom. So teaching them a ""quiet"" command is a must.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Shetland sheepdog overall is a healthy breed. But it is still prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide your Sheltie with fresh water. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's common to feed two measured meals per day. But be sure to discuss both the type of food and amount with your vet. For instance, your vet might recommend different diets based on age and/or activity level. Also, be mindful of treats and other extra food to prevent overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Shetland Sheepdog</h2><p>Shelties are a fairly popular dog breed, so you might be able to find a dog in need of a home at an animal shelter or rescue group. Ask to get your name on a breed wait list if possible. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $850 to $2,000 on average.</p><h2>Shetland Sheepdog Overview</h2><p>Intelligent and easy to train</p><p>Good for active owners</p><p>Generally friendly and affectionate</p><p>Likes to chase things, including cars</p><p>Needs regular grooming to prevent matting</p><p>Can be very vocal</p>",901

The breed closely resembles the more common Great Pyrenees. It features a wedge-shaped head with dark eyes and triangular drop ears. And its long tail often curls up and over the dog's back. Plus, the breed's long legs allow it to move swiftly, and it has loose skin around its neck that helps to protect it from attacks. That serves the akbash well in its role defending livestock from wolves and other predators. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Guardian Dog (United Kennel Club)</p><p>Height: 28 to 32 inches (female), 30 to 34 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 90 pounds (female), 120 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Medium to long double coat</p><p>Coat Color: White, light biscuit or gray shading acceptable</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Alert, independent, courageous</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Turkey</p><h2>Characteristics of the Akbash</h2><p>The akbash generally has an independent and watchful temperament. Even though it's quite intelligent, it can be difficult to train due to its self-governing personality. The breed also has strong protective instincts and will bark at and potentially become aggressive with perceived threats.</p><h2>History of the Akbash</h2><p>The akbash's origin is unclear, as its ancestors date back thousands of years in Turkey. It's possible that it has some mastiff and sighthound breeds in its mix. </p><p>The breed long has been used as a livestock guardian in part because its white coat allows it to blend in with flocks of sheep and other animals, giving it the element of surprise if a predator were to draw near. However, it is not a herding dog. The breed tends to be territorial and wary of strangers, and it will calmly lie among its flock scanning for danger.</p><p>The akbash began to gain a foothold in the United States in the 1970s, though it's still a very rare breed. The American Kennel Club does not yet recognize it. But the United Kennel Club does classify it as part of its Guardian Dog Group.</p><h2>Akbash Care</h2><p>The akbash doesn't require a great deal of exercise, and its grooming is fairly straightforward, though it can shed a lot. But you will have to put some time and effort into training and socialization to ensure that you have a well-mannered dog.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Because the akbash is a guardian dog and not a herding dog, it doesn't have extreme exercise requirements. These dogs don't have to run around gathering and moving livestock, but rather they watch over their herd from a comfortable vantage point. Aim for at least an hour per day of exercise to keep your akbash healthy. Walking, jogging, and hiking all are ideal ways to get some energy out. Puzzle toys can challenge your akbash's mind as well, though this isn't an overly playful breed.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your akbash at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Pay special attention to areas of the coat with feathering, which can tangle easily. Expect periods of higher shedding twice a year in the spring and fall. You might have to brush daily to keep up with the loose fur during those times.</p><p>Bathe your akbash about once a month, depending on how dirty it gets. Check your dog's ears weekly for dirt, wax buildup, and other abnormalities. In addition, check its nails monthly to see whether they need a trim. Aim to brush its teeth daily.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socializing your akbash when it's a puppy to instill good behaviors and prevent bad habits from forming. The breed's independent and stubborn nature can make training difficult, even though it is quite smart and can understand commands. Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. And be consistent in the behavior you expect when you give a command.</p><p>Give your akbash lots of positive experiences around new people and other dogs, as well as in various locations from an early age. This can help to curb its protective and territorial nature. However, that instinct is difficult to fully quell, so you'll likely have to exercise caution when your akbash is meeting strangers and even other dogs.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The akbash is overall a healthy dog, though it is prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure your akbash has access to fresh water. You might want to get a large water bowl for this big breed. Feed it a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. A food formulated especially for large breeds might be beneficial. But you should always discuss both the diet type and the amount with your vet.</p><p>It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But the akbash is a breed that's prone to bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twisting, which can arise from eating too quickly. Feeding smaller, more frequent meals can help to prevent this, along with keeping your dog calm around mealtimes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Akbash</h2><p>The akbash is a rare dog breed. It's not easily found at animal shelters and rescues, though it's still worth checking. You also might have trouble locating a breeder, depending on where you live.

The toyger was developed in the United States in the 1980s and remains one of the newest, most unique-looking cat breeds. Much of the toyger's appeal lies in its wild tiger-like appearance while being a domesticated cat. Unlike the ocicat, which has naturally developed markings, the toyger is a designer breed, similar to the Bengal, the Savannah, and the nearly extinct California spangle. The toyger (a portmanteau of ""toy"" and ""tiger"") is a playful, intelligent cat and an optimal choice for big-cat lovers, without the unethical ownership of a wild animal. With time, toyger breeders are hopeful the cats' resemblance to tigers will only grow closer with time. The cat is recognized by The International Cat Association but not the Cat Fancier's Association.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Toy Tiger</p><p>Personality: Friendly</p><p>Weight: 7 to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: About 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Orange, black, and white</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby</p><p>Eye Color: Usually ranging from dark brown to hazel</p><p>Lifespan: 10 to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><p><br/></p><h2>Toyger Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The toyger cat is a friendly, easygoing cat with an ideal temperament and personality. Toygers make great additions to families with children or pets and are ready to play and offer affection. If you're looking for a below-average amount of commitment to exercising your cat, the toyger's energy level may not be for you. Their intelligence makes them susceptible to boredom, so playtime is essential. Toygers are trainable and can be taught to do tricks.</p><h2>History of the Toyger Cat</h2><p>In the 1980s, breeder Judy Sugden (daughter of the original Bengal cat breeder, Jean Mill) worked with mackerel tabbies cats characterized by their wild stripes and an ""M"" shaped marking on their foreheads. Sugden noticed that her Bengal cat, Millwood Sharp Shooter, bore round spots on its head instead of the typical ""M"" shape. The spots sparked the realization that designing a domestic cat closely resembling a tiger was within Sugden's reach. </p><p>Sugden then started a breeding program using two cats: Scrapmetal, a domestic shorthair tabby, and Millwood Rumpled Spotskin, a big-boned Bengal. In 1993, Sugden proceeded to import Jammie Blu, a street cat from Kashmir, India, with the characteristic, unusual spotting between his ears, added him to the breeding pool, and accelerated the program. Pioneering breeders Anthony Hutcherson and Alice McKee joined Sugden's project later that year. The International Cat Association accepted the toyger for registration, and, in 2007, listed it as a championship breed, cementing its eligibility for cat shows.</p><h2>Toyger Cat Care</h2><p>The care routine for a toyger is standard for most domestic cats. Due to their friendly demeanor, playtime and grooming should be straightforward for both owner and cat.</p><p>Toyger cats are naturally active and require regular exercise. Because of their high trainability, you can train your toyger to walk on a leash and fetch. However, leash-walking isn't a necessity. Toygers are usually active indoors on their own, so independent playtime can be adequate exercise. Even though toygers are shorthaired cats, they still shed plentifully and should be brushed weekly. Tooth brushing, ear cleaning, and regular nail-trimming are essential as well.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Toygers are still a relatively rare breed, so understanding of their health problems is limited. However, it's thought that toygers may be at an increased risk for heart murmurs. Be sure to follow a regular check-up schedule, preventative care measures, and immunizations for your toyger.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The shape of a toyger's head in profile is described as a ""half-hexagon."" Toyger cats are long, lean, and muscular but not bulky, with a long, thin tail with a rounded tip. It has round small ears and bright green or blue eyes. Its nose is broad at the base, with the jowl area correspondingly wider. <br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The diet requirements for Toygers are those of any domestic short-haired cat. Obesity can reduce your cat's lifespan, so work with your vet to determine the best diet plan. Provide your toyger with high-quality wet and dry food and access to fresh, clean water. If you want to give your toyger a treat, a small piece of meat is always a good option.</p><p>As a relatively new breed, it does not have any known major breed-specific diseases.</p><p>The cat should get along with other cats or dogs and older children.</p><p>They are active, energetic, and highly trainable.</p><p>Toygers look wild and exotic yet have sweet disposition of a domestic cat.</p><p>They are difficult to find through breeders or adoption and expensive.</p><p>Although no major health conditions are associated with this breed, it may be prone to a heart murmur, a minor condition.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Toyger Cat</h2><p>You may be able to find a purebred toyger cat through a breeder in your region, but there are under 30 toyger breeders in the world. The average price of buying a toyger cat is $2,000-$3,500. If you would prefer to adopt, you may be able to find a toyger cat at a purebred rescue. Certain states require owners to have a permit for toyger cats because of their relation to Bengal cats, which possess more genetic overlap with wild cats. This may be a consideration in adding a toyger cat to your family.</p><h2>Types of Toyger Cats</h2><p>There is only one type of toyger cat.

These dogs generally have a friendly, sweet, and loyal disposition. They are used both for hunting and companionship. Above all, this breed belongs in an active home where there is plenty of access to explore the outdoors. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound</p><p>HEIGHT: 21 to 25 inches (female), 22 to 27 inches (male)<br/>WEIGHT: 45 to 65 pounds (female), 55 to 80 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Blue ticked or blue ticked and tan, black spots</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Sweet-tempered, active, affectionate</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Mild-Mannered Bluetick Coonhound</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Bluetick Coonhound</h2><p>Bluetick coonhounds tend to have a very affectionate temperament with their owners. They also can get along well with other dogs. But the high prey drive part of their personality might cause them to see other household pets as their quarry rather than a friend. As high-energy dogs, they need lots of exercise every day.</p><h2>History of the Bluetick Coonhound</h2><p>Bluetick coonhounds were developed in the United States, and their bloodline dates back even prior to the founding of the country. The English foxhound, as well as some other hound breeds, are also thought to have played a role in the bluetick coonhound's development.</p><p>The result was a big scenthound with good endurance and an excellent nose for the hunting trail. Frontiersmen used the breed for raccoon hunting, hence its name, as well as big-game hunting. The dogs work well in packs.</p><p>The breed has been recognized by other kennel clubs for decades, such as the United Kennel Club in 1946. But the American Kennel Club didn't recognize it until 2009. Even so, it is a moderately popular dog breed throughout the U.S. and is even the mascot of the University of Tennessee.</p><h2>Bluetick Coonhound Care</h2><p>Bluetick coonhounds require lots of activity, along with proper training and socialization, to be happy and healthy dogs. Their desire to follow a scent also must be managed. Luckily, their grooming needs are fairly easy and straightforward. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As hunting dogs, bluetick coonhounds are bred to have high energy and endurance. So adequate daily physical activity is a must to burn that energy. Aim to spend at least one to two hours per day on brisk walks, jogs, hikes, and play. You also can get your dog involved in dog sports, such as tracking and agility, to challenge it mentally and physically. </p><p>Always keep your dog on leash or in a secure fenced area when exercising. Once these dogs catch a scent, it's extremely difficult to stop their desire to follow it, and they can quickly get far away. They also can be good escape artists, so it's best to monitor them even if they're in a fenced area.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The short, shiny coat of a bluetick coonhound has a moderate shedding rate. Routine basic grooming is typically all that's necessary to keep your coonhound looking its best. Brush weekly to remove loose fur and distribute oils. </p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog has gotten. Likewise, check whether it needs a nail trim monthly; active dogs often wear down their nails naturally and can go longer between trims. </p><p>Moreover, like all breeds with floppy ears, it's important to keep your dog's ears clean and dry. Check them at least weekly for any dirt, debris, redness, swelling, or other abnormalities. <br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>These dogs respond to training fairly well, though they can have a stubborn side. Aim to start training when your dog is still a puppy. A large, strong, energetic adult coonhound with poor manners can be difficult to manage.</p><p>Always use positive training methods, and be consistent in your training cues. Enroll in an obedience class as soon as you're able. Also, taking part in other dog activities, such as tracking, can help strengthen your bond with your dog. </p><p>Socialization is equally important to training. Ideally from a young age, expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations to boost its comfort and confidence. Blueticks that don't get enough attention might develop problematic behaviors, including excessively using their booming hound bay. They're best for households where someone is home most of the day, and they will generally also enjoy the company of another dog.<br/></p><p> </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Bluetick coonhounds are a healthy dog breed in general.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible to your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. Most owners feed two measured meals per day. Discuss the type of diet and quantity with your vet, as this can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. Also, be mindful about feeding treats and other foods to prevent your dog from overeating.</p><p>Moreover, if your coonhound tends to eat quickly, this can trigger bloat. You might do better feeding smaller meals more frequently or using a food puzzle to slowly dispense the meal.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bluetick Coonhound</h2><p>Check local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a bluetick coonhound in need of a home. If you're looking for a breeder puppy, expect to pay around $1,000 on average, though this can vary widely depending on bloodline and other factors.</p><h2>Bluetick Coonhound Overview</h2><p>Sweet and loyal</p><p>Low grooming maintenance</p><p>Typically gets along well with other dogs</p><p>Can be very vocal</p><p>Can be stubborn and challenging to train</p><p>Needs lots of exercise</p>",899

This rare dog breed has some interesting physical attributes. It features at least six toes per foot, as well as elongated paw pads. Its neck can bend all the way back, so its head touches its spine. Its triangular ears can fold shut to block debris. And its shoulders are flexible enough to allow the legs to stretch out perpendicularly to each side of the body. All of these traits helped the dog do what it was bred for: hunting puffins on rocky cliffs. </p><p>These dogs are typically energetic, happy, and loyal, but they aren't ideal for the novice dog owner. They can be independent, stubborn, and wary of strangers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 12 to 14 inches (female), 13 to 15 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 20 to 30 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, gray, reddish brown, sable and white, white, or yellow with/without white, gray, and/or black markings and/or black tips</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, companionable, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Norway<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Norwegian Lundehund</h2><p>The Norwegian lundehund generally has an alert but friendly temperament. It typically doesn't have an overly affectionate personality. But it does enjoy being active with its owner.</p><h2>History of the Norwegian Lundehund</h2><p>The Norwegian lundehund's exact origin is unclear. The breed has been found in Lofoten, an archipelago of Norway, for centuries. These dogs were very important to the residents and local economy, as they could scale the rocky cliffs to catch puffins that were nesting there. (means puffin in Norwegian, and means dog.) </p><p>Households kept multiple lundehunds for hunting purposes. But when bird nets began to replace them, the breed's numbers declined. Then, around World War II, the canine distemper virus almost caused the breed to go extinct. But people managed to gather the few lundehunds left to preserve the breed.</p><p>The Norwegian lundehund is still rare today. It entered the American Kennel Club's foundation stock service, which helps to preserve breed standards, in 1996. The AKC recognized it as an official breed in 2011.</p><h2>Norwegian Lundehund Care</h2><p>Norwegian lundehunds are athletes, but they don't require an excessive amount of daily exercise. Their grooming is also relatively low-maintenance. It's essential, however, that owners put some effort into training and socialization, so they develop into well-mannered dogs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to give your dog at least one to two hours per day of exercise via walks, jogging, hiking, vigorous play, and more. Puzzle toys can help to provide mental challenges. This breed's athleticism can make it a good candidate for dog sports, including agility. If a lundehund doesn't get enough exercise and mental stimulation each day, it might engage in problem behaviors, such as unwanted chewing.</p><p>Moreover, keep your lundehund on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. Otherwise, its prey drive might cause it to run off chasing perceived prey, and recall might be difficult.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog's coat weekly to remove loose fur and prevent matting. Expect periods of higher shedding often in the spring and fall, as the dog loses its undercoat. Brush more frequently, even up to daily, during these times to keep up with all the loose fur. </p><p>Plan on a bath roughly once a month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. The lundehund's coat typically stays relatively clean. Be sure to check its ears at least weekly for any debris, wax buildup, and irritation. And see whether it's due for a nail trim every month or so. Plus, aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socializing your Norwegian lundehund ideally from a young age to make sure it's a well-adjusted dog. This breed typically does well with positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. However, it can be especially sensitive to harsh corrections, shutting down and refusing to learn. In addition, lundehunds tend to be very smart problem-solvers, but they can have an independent and stubborn streak. So it's important to keep training sessions fun and varied to hold their interest. </p><p>Furthermore, aim to expose your lundehund to other people and dogs from an early age. This breed can be wary of strangers. But having lots of positive experiences should help to boost its comfort and confidence. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your dog. Feed it a quality canine diet with balanced nutrition, typically via two measured meals per day. Because this breed can have a sensitive stomach, you might have to provide a special diet. But you should always consult a vet about any diet changes. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Norwegian Lundehund</h2><p>The Norwegian lundehund is a rare breed, so it's not typical that you would find one available for adoption. But it's still worth checking animal shelters and rescue groups near you and seeing whether you can get your name on a breed wait list. Likewise, breeders might be difficult to come by, depending on where you live. If you're looking for a puppy from a responsible breeder, expect to pay around $2,000 to $3,000 on average.</p><h2>Norwegian Lundehund Overview</h2><p>Unique physical features</p><p>Suited to an owner with an active lifestyle</p><p>Basic grooming needs</p><p>Prone to stomach problems</p><p>Rare and difficult to come by</p><p>Can be standoffish around strangers</p>",878

Some owners trim the coat short in what's called a ""puppy cut"" for easier maintenance. The Lhasa apso's eyes are typically dark and oval, and its tail curls over its back. Overall, these dogs have a well-balanced build. They are hardy little dogs that tend to be smart and confident but also comical. Their history dates back centuries as a guard dog.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 10 to 11 inches (male), slightly smaller (female)</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 to 18 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, silky</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, black and tan, cream, golden, grizzle, red, red gold, or white with/without white markings, black tips, brindle, sable, black mask with tips, or parti-color</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Alert, affectionate, intelligent </p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Tibet</p><h2>Characteristics of the Lhasa Apso</h2><p>The Lhasa apso typically has an affectionate personality with its family but can be standoffish with strangers. It also has a vigilant watchdog aspect of its temperament and is a moderate barker.</p><h2>History of the Lhasa Apso</h2><p>The Lhasa apso originated in Tibet around a thousand years ago and evolved for the harsh climate of the Himalayas. Named for the city of Lhasa, the small canines served as indoor watchdogs in temples and palaces. With their highly developed hearing, they would alert monks and others whether anyone got past the outdoor guard dogs often Tibetan mastiffs and other large breeds. </p><p>Lhasa apsos long have had a connection with the Dalai Lama. And in fact, the Dalai Lama gave a pair of Lhasas to naturalist and world traveler Suydam Cutting in the early 1900s. These dogs helped to establish the breed in the United States. </p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1935 as part of the terrier group. But it was later moved to the non-sporting group in 1959.</p><h2>Lhasa Apso Care</h2><p>Lhasa apsos require a moderate amount of exercise every day, and consistent training and socialization are a must for a well-adjusted dog. Their grooming needs can be fairly high, depending on the length at which you keep their coat.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan on around an hour of daily exercise for a Lhasa apso via walks, romping around in a secure area, playtime, dog sports, and other activities. These dogs often will entertain themselves with toys to burn off some mental and physical energy, but they like being active with their humans as well. Puzzle toys are an especially good option to provide them with a mental challenge.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Lhasa apso's coat will grow continuously and thus needs regular trims. For easier upkeep, some owners opt for a puppy cut in which the hair is clipped fairly close to the body. But it's also common to see Lhasa apsos with a long coat parted down the middle that extends almost to the ground. The short coat should be brushed at least weekly. And the long coat must be brushed daily to prevent tangles and mats. </p><p>Plan to bathe your Lhasa apso roughly every other week, especially if you keep the coat long. Dog-safe conditioner or finishing spray can help to remove tangles. Be sure to brush out and dry the coat well after a bath.</p><p>Check your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. And look at its nails at least monthly to see whether they're due for a trim. In addition, aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Lhasa apsos are an intelligent breed. But they are only moderately easy to train due to their sometimes stubborn and strong-willed nature. They prefer interesting and varied, rather than repetitive, training sessions. And positive reinforcement methods, as opposed to harsh corrections, are a must. Aim to start training from an early age to prevent bad habits from forming. And always be consistent with your commands. </p><p>Likewise, start socialization from a young age to help quell the breed's vigilant nature and wariness of strangers. Expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations to boost its comfort level and adaptability. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your dog should always have access to fresh water. And it should eat a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. A diet that has a sufficient amount of protein and fat is important to maintain the breed's thick skin and hair. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure you're not overfeeding. But you should always discuss both the type of diet and the quantity with your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Lhasa Apso</h2><p>The Lhasa apso is a fairly popular dog breed, so it's worth checking animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a dog in need of a home.

It loves to be around its family, though it can be reserved around strangers. A somewhat independent and stubborn streak also is usually a part of the breed's personality, but it still takes fairly well to training. </p><h2>History of the Tibetan Spaniel</h2><p>The Tibetan spaniel is an ancient dog breed. Early versions of the breed are depicted on Eastern artwork dating back all the way to 1100 BC. Buddhist monks in Tibet kept these dogs in their monasteries as both companions and watchdogs. The vigilant Tibetan spaniel would alert its larger cousin, the Tibetan mastiff, of potential dangers to check out.</p><p>The monks greatly valued these dogs and even called them ""little lions"" or ""lion dogs,"" an honor given that lions were considered sacred. They also offered Tibetan spaniels as prized gifts to royalty. </p><p>The Tibetan spaniel made its way to the Western world in the late 1800s. The Tibetan Spaniel Club of America formed in 1971. And the American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1983.</p><h2>Tibetan Spaniel Care</h2><p>Tibetan spaniels don't need a great deal of exercise each day. Their coat requires regular grooming to keep it tidy. These protective little dogs should receive consistent training and socialization starting at a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan on at least an hour per day of exercise for a Tibetan spaniel. That can include morning and evening dog walks plus playtime in between. Puzzle toys can provide mental stimulation for your dog. The Tibetan spaniel may also enjoy dog sports, such as agility, for mental and physical challenges. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Tibetan spaniel's coat does not need trimming unless there are areas of fur you want to tidy up. Brush the coat at least a couple times per week to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Pay special attention to the fur behind the ears and the longer feathering, as it's prone to matting. Expect periods of higher shedding, often when the weather changes, during which you'll have to brush more frequently to keep up with the loose fur.</p><p>Give your dog a bath roughly every month, and check its ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Also, check its nails monthly to see whether they're due for a trim. Aim to brush its teeth every day with a canine toothpaste.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Tibetan spaniel is smart, but it can be stubborn about training at times. It's important to start training from a young age to prevent bad habits from forming. Always use positive-reinforcement methods, such as treats and praise, as the breed can be sensitive to harsh corrections. And keep training sessions varied and fun to hold your dog's attention. </p><p>You might have to work extra on training your dog to be comfortable when you leave it alone. Tibetan spaniels are prone to separation anxiety and are best in a household where someone is home for most of the day. A professional dog trainer or behaviorist can give you tips on how to combat separation anxiety.</p><p>Furthermore, start socializing your Tibetan spaniel from puppyhood. This breed's protective instinct can cause it to be wary of strangers, which in turn can trigger alert barking. But allowing your dog to have lots of positive interactions with strangers can go a long way to boost its comfort and confidence. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Tibetan spaniels generally are healthy dogs, but they are prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your Tibetan spaniel.

The name ""snowshoe"" refers to the cat's four distinctive white paws. Its other colorpoint markings resemble those of a Siamese, and its personality is similar, too. This friendly feline is a healthy, medium-sized purebred that makes a loving and devoted family pet.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, sociable, confident but needy of attention, intelligent, playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 30 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short</p><p>Coat Colors: Light body with darker blue or sable points (ears, mask, legs, and tail); white chest, paws, and parts of face</p><p>Coat Patterns: Colorpoint</p><p>Eye Color: Blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Snowshoe Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Snowshoes are known for having a similar personality to the Siamese half of their ancestry. They are generally affectionate and bond strongly with their owners. Confident, intelligent, and sociable, they tend to use their loud voices to demand attention and ""talk"" with their owners.</p><p>Known for their willingness to make friends with other cats and friendly dogs, snowshoe cats can thrive in a multi-pet household, but they will likely ""speak up"" to get the play time or cuddles they deserve.</p><h2>History of the Snowshoe Cat</h2><p>The snowshoe cat breed began in the 1960s when Dorothy Hinds-Daugherty, an American breeder of Siamese cats, discovered three kittens in one of her litters that each had four white paws. The paws, combined with the striking Siamese colorpoint pattern, delighted Hinds-Daugherty. She decided to cross these Siamese kittens with American shorthair cats with tuxedo markings in an attempt to develop the snowshoe breed.<br/></p><p>The breed is growing in popularity. It was recognized in 1982 by the Cat Fanciers' Association and in 1994 by the International Cat Association.</p><p>Public interest in the breed was piqued by the late Grumpy Cat, a snowshoe cross, who gained celebrity status as a social media star in 2012. While she had distinct snowshoe colors and markings, Grumpy Cat's glum-looking features were considered a result of dwarfism and were not characteristic of the breed.</p><h2>Snowshoe Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This breed requires minimal maintenance when it comes to grooming. They are a short-haired variety and are known for being very clean. They will shed somewhat, but a once-weekly rub-over with a rubber grooming brush should be enough to keep any dead hairs at bay.</p><p>Dental disease is one of the most common health problems for cats of any breed, and it is a perfectly preventable issue. Make sure you feed a high-quality diet and, if your cat is tolerant enough, you can even work on adding teeth brushing into their weekly grooming schedule. Getting them used to having their mouth examined from an early age and having them associate it with good things can help.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Snowshoes, like their Siamese relatives, are clever and curious. They enjoy surveying their territory from high vantage points, such as the tops of cat trees, to spy an opportunity for adventure or someone ready to play. Your snowshoe will appreciate an environment with plenty of toys and willing game participants to avoid boredom.<br/></p><p>Since they are so smart, snowshoes are relatively easy to train. Teaching simple tricks and commands to your cat using positive reinforcement training methods can increase the bond between you and help to keep your cat stimulated both mentally and physically.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>So far, in their brief breed history, snowshoes have proven to be pretty healthy cats. Due to their Siamese genetics, crossed eyes and kinked tails will occasionally crop up in a litter, but these traits are not painful or debilitating.<br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Snowshoes are medium to large cats with a soft, robust appearance. Their heads tend to be rather round with large eyes and slightly rounded ears.</p><p>The ideal snowshoe breed standard calls for distinctly darker pointing on the ears, tails, legs, and top of the face. The chest, paws, and lower part of the face should be white, and the eyes a bright shade of blue.</p><p>Coat shade and markings vary across the breed. The pattern is determined by a recessive gene, so it can be difficult to achieve consistency. Interestingly, The breed is born white, and their darker pointing only begins to develop as they mature.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Snowshoes, like all cats, fare well on a high-quality meat-based diet as they are obligate carnivores. The food must contain a sufficient quantity of the amino acid taurine, which is found in animal-based proteins. If your cat becomes deficient in taurine, which can happen from eating dog food or plant-based foods, it can suffer potentially life-threatening eye and heart problems.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Snowshoe Cat</h2><p>You should always do your research when you are thinking about welcoming a new kitten into your home. Seek out a reputable breeder who is raising the kittens alongside their mother in a home environment where they are receiving the right socialization and care.</p><p>Because the breed is rare, there are not so many breeders to choose from, and you may need to travel further or go on a waiting list.</p><h2>Snowshoe Cat Overview</h2><p>While snowshoes may be a little aloof with strangers, they develop strong attachments to people they get to know. They enjoy being with their human family as much as possible and can become depressed if left alone for long.<br/></p><p>They happily adapt to homes with other cats, respectful children, and gentle dogs (providing introductions are performed properly). Despite their soft and cuddly appearance, though, snowshoe cats can be a bit bossy with other pets usually all in good fun.<br/></p><p>If you enjoy quiet tranquillity, think twice before bringing home a snowshoe cat. Like their Siamese relatives, they are particularly vocal and like to be heard. They communicate with a variety of meows.

High intelligence helps to shape this terrier's personality, as well, and can make it strong-willed at times.</p><h2>History of the West Highland White Terrier</h2><p>Terriers have a long history in the Scottish Highlands, dating back centuries as working farm dogs and hunting dogs. Many were used to keep the rodent population at bay. Besides the Westie, the Scottie, cairn terrier, and Dandie Dinmont are other breeds that descended from these dogs.</p><p>The Westie breed can trace its roots to the 1700s when Edward Donald Malcolm, 16th Laird of Poltalloch, bred for white terriers to exterminate the rodents on his estate. Thus, the breed was sometimes referred to as the Poltalloch terrier. It's said that Malcolm had a reddish dog that was shot when it was mistaken for a fox. Consequently, he wanted only white dogs that would be identifiable. </p><p>By the end of the 1800s, the West Highland white terrier had its present name and was being entered in dog shows. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1908, and since then it's become quite popular in the U.S. People might recognize the breed as the mascot for the dog food Cesar.</p><h2>West Highland White Terrier Care</h2><p>Westies need a moderate amount of exercise each day and have somewhat involved grooming. They also should receive training and socialization from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to give your Westie at least an hour per day of exercise to keep it healthy and happy. A couple of daily walks and some vigorous playtime are ideal ways to burn both mental and physical energy. Westies also enjoy dog sports, including agility, rally, and earthdog events.</p><p>Unless your Westie is in a securely fenced area, avoid letting it off leash outside. This breed's high prey drive can cause it to take off quickly chasing small animals and other perceived prey. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The traditional way of grooming a Westie's coat is stripping (the plucking of dead hairs with a special tool) roughly every month. But some owners opt to have the coat clipped instead every four to six weeks, which tends to make it softer and curlier. You also should brush your Westie's coat at least weekly to remove any loose hair and dirt, prevent tangles, and distribute oils.</p><p>Plan on a bath every four to six weeks, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Check your dog's nails roughly every month to see whether they're in need of a trim. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. Aim to brush its teeth daily. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Westies are quite smart. But they can have an independent and stubborn streak that might make training difficult. Start both training and socialization from an early age to prevent bad habits from forming. Keep training sessions fun and varied to hold your dog's attention, and always use positive reinforcement. </p><p>Try to expose your Westie to different people and other dogs starting when it's young to help it become comfortable around strangers. Westies usually can get along with other dogs and even cats when raised together from a young age. But they might view smaller household pets as prey, especially rodents.</p><p>Westies often can be problem barkers, alerting you to every passerby and moving creature. But if you are diligent, you can train them to bark just once and quiet on command. Westies also can have a tendency to dig. But if you're consistent about redirecting that behavior from a young age, you might be able to put a stop to it.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your Westie. Feed a high-quality canine diet that has balanced nutrition. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But you should always discuss the amount and type of food with your vet to make sure it's suitable for your individual dog. Also, monitor treats and other extra food to prevent your dog from overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a West Highland White Terrier</h2><p>Westies are a fairly popular dog breed in the United States. So it's possible to find one in need of a home at local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $1,500 on average.</p><h2>West Highland White Terrier Overview</h2><p>Very affectionate and playful</p><p>Typically good with respectful kids</p><p>Doesn't shed excessively</p><p>Tends to dig</p><p>Can be stubborn about training</p><p>Can be very vocal</p>",876

These dogs are simply the smaller variety of the dachshund dog breed, with the larger variety being the standard dachshund. Mini dachshunds typically weigh 11 pounds or less while standard dachshunds weigh 16 to 32 pounds on average. The breed is generally spunky and playful, and it makes for an alert little watchdog.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Weight: 11 pounds or less</p><p>Height: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Coat: Smooth, wirehaired, or longhaired</p><p>Coat Color: Black and cream, black and tan, blue and tan, chocolate and tan, cream, red, wheaten, wild boar, blue and cream, fawn and tan, fawn and cream, or chocolate and cream with/without brindle, sable, piebald, or dapple</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 16 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, friendly, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Mini Dachshund</h2><p>Mini dachshunds generally have a friendly and upbeat temperament. They tend to be quite playful and need a moderate amount of exercise, despite their small size. There often is a stubborn streak to their personality that can complicate training. </p><h2>History of the Mini Dachshund</h2><p>The dachshund, or ""badger dog"" in German, can trace its ancestors back roughly 600 years ago in Germany. People specifically bred for dogs with long, low-to-the-ground bodies for their ability to dig into badger dens on hunts. </p><p>The dogs also had to be bold, athletic, and clever enough to take on the badgers. And they needed a loud bark, so their humans could keep track of them as they burrowed into the underground dens. Today's dachshunds still retain these traits. </p><p>Breeders continued to refine the dachshund, producing different sizes to hunt different types of game. Various coat types and colors also took shape toward the end of the 1800s. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1885.</p><h2>Mini Dachshund Care</h2><p>Mini dachshunds don't require an excessive amount of exercise, but they still need mental stimulation and physical activity each day. Their grooming is fairly straightforward, depending on their coat type. And they should receive early and consistent training and socialization. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Don't expect a mini dachshund to be content sitting around the house all day. These dogs may be small, but they still need to exercise. Plan on at least an hour a day of activity. Moderate-length morning and evening walks plus vigorous playtime should suffice. Puzzle toys and dog sports, such as tracking, also can help to burn mental energy. </p><p>Always keep your dog on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outside. The dachshund's high prey drive can cause it to run off quickly if it sees a small animal or other perceived prey. Likewise, be aware that these dogs often enjoy digging and might burrow under fences if you're not watching them. </p><p>Furthermore, aim to prevent your dachshund from jumping on and off furniture or racing up and down stairs to prevent back injuries.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>If you have a smooth-coated dachshund, plan on brushing roughly once a week to remove loose fur. The longhaired variety should be brushed a few times a week to prevent tangles and mats. The wirehaired variety should have its coat stripped several times a year plus a weekly brushing. You also might have to trim its beard and eyebrows to keep them looking neat. </p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. The longhaired variety might benefit from a canine detangler spray. Also, check your dog's nails monthly to see whether they need a trim. And look in its ears at least weekly for signs of wax buildup and infection. Finally, aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Dachshunds are quite smart. But they also can be independent and stubborn, which may make training a challenge. Plus, they can get distracted if they see something they perceive as prey that they want to chase. </p><p>Start training and socialization from as young of an age as possible. Dachshunds respond well to positive-reinforcement methods, such as treats. Harsh corrections can cause them to shut down and refuse to learn. </p><p>In addition to obedience training, aim to expose your dachshund to different people and other dogs from an early age. Dachshunds don't always like strangers (people and dogs). But having positive experiences around them can help to boost their comfort and confidence. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Dachshunds that are well cared for typically have long, healthy lives.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your dachshund. And feed it a nutritionally balanced canine diet, typically via two measured meals per day. Always discuss both the type of diet and the amount with your vet. Plus, be mindful of treats and other extra food. It's imperative that dachshunds don't become overweight. The excess weight can put too much strain on the breed's long back and result in disc problems.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mini Dachshund</h2><p>Mini dachshunds can be difficult, but not impossible, to find at animal shelters. See whether your local shelter has a breed wait list you can get your name on. Or check out dachshund rescue groups to find a dog in need of a home.

Despite its petite and fragile appearance, the breed is quite bold even brazen. It boasts distinct features, like wide eyes and ears that are usually erect and very large in relation to its small head and body. The Chihuahua has a unique personality and can be quite an affectionate and loyal companion dog.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 6 to 9 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 2 to 6 pounds</p><p>COAT: Chihuahuas can have smooth short coats or longer fringed coats.</p><p>COAT COLOR: They are seen in many colors, either solid or a combination of two colors. Most common colors include black, tan, fawn, cream, white, blue, silver, chocolate, and red.</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 20 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, alert, lively, attentive, bright, companionable</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Mexico</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Confident Chihuahua</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Chihuahua</h2><p>Chihuahuas are incredibly popular pets and those owners who care for them consider themselves Chihuahua fans for life. Beloved for their spunky (and sometimes sassy) nature, Chihuahuas make up for what they lack in size with larger-than-life personalities.</p><h2>History of the Chihuahua</h2><p>The Chihuahua originated in Mexico in the state for which it was named. A likely ancestor of the breed was the Techichi, a sacred dog of the ancient Toltecs. The ancestors of the Chihuahua may have been present earlier than the ninth century some believe that the smaller size of the breed may have resulted from crossing with Chinese crested dogs.</p><p>First registered by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1904, the Chihuahua is one of the oldest breeds on the American continent and one of the smallest breeds in the world. It's also highly recognizable, thanks to its tiny size and big personality. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Taco Bell ad campaigns starring the breed boosted its popularity, as did Chihuahuas being featured in reality television series as purse dogs of rich, famous young women.</p><h2>Chihuahua Care</h2><p>The Chihuahua's affectionate and attention-loving nature makes it a snuggly dog that enjoys being carried around and pampered. When raised and handled appropriately, the Chihuahua can make a wonderful companion for many kinds of families. Not all Chihuahuas will automatically get along with children, but they can be trained and socialized to get along with kids. It is often recommended that Chihuahuas not be adopted into a family with young children, as the children may not handle a small dog as gently as is needed to prevent injury.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Many people underestimate the exercise needs of smaller dogs, and it is absolutely essential for your Chihuahuas to get regular exercise. Chihuahuas have a moderate to high energy level and may develop behavioral problems if not given enough activity. Exercise and mental stimulation will help maintain your dog's mental and physical health. Stay aware when you are walking a Chihuahua, as they can be aggressive toward larger dogs if not properly trained. You may need to be on alert to remove your dog from potential conflict.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Smooth-coated Chihuahuas need little more than basic routine grooming due to their short hair. However, the long-coated Chihuahua varieties require more frequent grooming, especially routine hair brushing. Due to its small size, the Chihuahua's nails don't wear down naturally, so it's important that you trim their nails regularly to keep them from becoming overgrown and uncomfortable. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>The sassy attitude of the Chihuahua demands proper socialization and in-depth obedience training. Without adequate socialization, the breed can become fearful and defensive, especially around new people or animals. An untrained Chihuahua can act defiant and defensive towards its owner and other people. Though stubborn at times, the breed is smart and can become well-behaved with dedication and consistency. It's also essential that you teach your Chihuahua to tolerate being handled at a young age, especially for things like nail trims and grooming.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to inherit health conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Due to their small size, Chihuahuas need only 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dry food per day. You will need to monitor your dog to ensure it is not getting overweight, as obesity can lead to a shorter lifespan. Consult your veterinarian about an appropriate diet if your pet has a health condition or is gaining too much weight.</p><p>The small size of a Chihuahua's jaw makes their teeth weaker, so you will need to support your pet with daily dental care, including brushing. You should provide dental chews and a diet that requires chewing, which will naturally help reduce plaque. Good dry dog food for Chihuahuas will have large and dense pieces.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Chihuahua</h2><p>Since Chihuahuas are such a popular dog breed, there are many verified breeders across the country. Make sure to work with someone who can provide medical records and references for their dogs. Alternatively, there are plenty of specialized Chihuahua rescue organizations around the country as well.</p><h2>Chihuahua Overview</h2><p>Cuddly</p><p>Intelligent pet for the right owner</p><p>Small and easy to transport</p><p>Does not tolerate cold temperatures</p><p>Requires a high level of physical exercise</p><p>Can be aggressive if not properly trained</p>",841

It's known for its typical blue-toned coat, smooth, sleek appearance, and intense bright yellow or rich brown eyes. The Lacy is a bold, intelligent, and active breed that was originally developed to work feral hogs. These driven, determined dogs also excel at herding cattle and hunting wild boar. Since their inception in the mid-19<sup>th</sup>century, the Blue Lacy has developed into one of the working breeds preferred by ranchers, hunters, cowboys, and trappers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working Group</p><p>HEIGHT: 18 to 21 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 25 to 50 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short and smooth</p><p>COAT COLORS: Blue (gray, light silver, charcoal), red (light cream, rust), or tri-colored</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 16 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, bold, active, devoted, alert, and intense</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States (Texas)</p><h2>Characteristics of the Blue Lacy</h2><p>The Blue Lacy has always loved having a job to do and plenty of open space to run around. They are energetic, dedicated dogs capable of handling livestock ranging from longhorn cattle to hens. Lacys have been trusted watchdogs, as well as herding and droving animals, throughout history.</p><h2>History of the Blue Lacy</h2><p>The Lacy dog's name comes from the family that developed the breed. The Lacy brothers Frank, George, Ewin, and Harry began to create the breed when they lived in Kentucky. But when they moved to Texas in 1858 and settled in the Hill Country, they became serious about mixing greyhounds, scenthounds, and wolves to develop a fast herding dog to round up and drive their free-roaming hogs to markets in Austin for selling.</p><p>As Blue Lacy dogs grew in awareness and popularity with rural American ranchers in the Southwestern regions, their role expanded from hog herding to locating wounded deer and chasing game. The breed made a name for itself by officially becoming the official State Dog Breed of Texas in 2005 when Governor Rick Perry signed the legislation.</p><p>As ranchers began to use new technologies to herd livestock, the need for Lacy dogs slowed down, and the breed came close to extinction. However, the breed became known more as a hunting companion, which dramatically increased the demand for the Lacy today the dog is the most common one used by trappers in the U.S.</p><p>Some historians believe that the presence of Lacy dogs in the Hill Country influenced Fred Gipson, who was raised in nearby Mason County, to write the novel ""Old Yeller"" (published in the 1950s) which is the classic story about a boy and his dog. The dog in the book, however, was a black mouth cur.</p><h2>Blue Lacy Care</h2><p>Although Lacys make excellent companions and are great with children, they require a calm, assertive leader who isn't afraid to set clear and consistent rules. Easily trainable, they also require consistent and daily physical and mental stimulation. Blue Lacys are naturally territorial and will always go out of their way to protect their property and their family, but they may not always do well entering homes with other pets due to their high prey drive.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>It's important that an owner of a Blue Lacy provide the pet with plenty of outdoor time and space to run and, ideally, a job to do. These dogs will require long, brisk daily walks and plenty of romps in the backyard, but even that may not be enough; many of these dogs will still demand a challenging job such as herding, hunting, tracking, agility, or flyball. Experts suggest that Lacys need a minimum of 30 minutes but more like 90 minutes of vigorous exercise a day.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Lacys only need basic dog grooming. Their short, tight coat needs minimal maintenance: a once or twice weekly brushing, with more frequent brushing during seasonal shedding times. Otherwise, keep their teeth taken care of, nails trimmed, and ears clean.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The breed's intelligence means that they are generally easy to train, but they are sensitive to yelling; Blue Lacys will always respond better to stern but soft commands.</p><p>They will adapt well to most living conditions and make great family pets with proper socialization.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Blue Lacy should perform well with high-quality commercially or home-prepared (under veterinary supervision) dog food. Fresh, clean water should be available at all times for this active, high-energy dog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Lacys are a very healthy, robust breed. However, all dogs are susceptible to certain conditions.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Blue Lacy</h2><p>Because they were created to be working dogs, most breeders prefer to place these pups in ranching and hunting homes to preserve that heritage and allow Blue Lacys to do what they do best: work.</p><p>Though rare, you may be able to find a Blue Lacy dog from a shelter or rescue group. If you choose to work with a breeder, expect to pay between $400 to $1,000 for a Lacy puppy.

When it finds a match, the intelligent komondor makes a top-notch furry friend. This powerful guardian and beloved pet has a temperament that is calm and quiet until it senses danger and springs into action, fiercely protecting its home and loved ones.</p><h2>History of the Komondor</h2><p>An ancient breed, komondors are originally from Hungary. Experts believe the breed, descended from the Caucasian shepherd, was brought there by traveling nomads in the 13th century. The breed was revered in Hungary, used for centuries to guard not herd flocks of sheep. Their long white coats allow them to camouflage among curly-haired sheep to stealthily attack predators.</p><p>The American Kennel Club recognized the komondor in 1937. The breed was nearly wiped out during the World War II era, leaving only a few dozen individual dogs. The breed was slowly re-established in Hungary but remains a fairly rare breed to this day.</p><p>A leaping komondor is featured on the cover of the 1996 album released by American musician Beck. Since the album was released, the image has become one of the most recognizable covers of all time.</p><h2>Komondor Care</h2><p>Komondors are not known to be a low-maintenance breed. Their corded hair requires special care, they need regular exercise, and they rely on strong leadership when it comes to training. With proper training, komondors are loving, playful pets.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>As expected from canines in the working group, komondors are athletic and agile dogs. They need daily exercise to stay happy and healthy, preferably free runs and one or two leisurely 30-minute walks a day remember that they were bred to guard sheep, not herd them.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>There's no denying that komondor coats are stunning. To maintain their luscious locks, owners must follow a fairly strict grooming regimen. Experts advise owners to never brush their corded hair but to wash them regularly. Just be sure to rinse them completely free of shampoo and dry thoroughly by squeezing them with towels. The coat could begin to smell like mildew if not dried efficiently. Cords will also need to be kept free of dirt and debris to avoid foul odors separating the locks can be done easily by hand and should be done every few months.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Early socialization is crucial for komondors. As protective pups, they are often wary of all strangers and tend to bark or lunge. You can minimize this through socialization and obedience training, which works best when started at an early age.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Komondors are generally healthy, but, like all dogs, they may develop a number of health conditions depending on genetics, their environment, and overall care.</p><p>Find a reputable breeder who can provide certificates of health and health clearances for your pup's parents. That way, you can better understand the health risks associated with your komondor.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The amount you should feed your komondor will vary with size, age, and lifestyle, so it's best to speak with your veterinarian to find the best diet suited to your dog.</p><p>Dogs should always be fed a high-quality diet that contains lean proteins and crucial vitamins for optimal health. Again, speak with your veterinarian to determine the best fit.</p><p>Determining the best quality dog food can be difficult. As a general rule, look for foods without fillers like modified cornstarch, soybean hulls, and other by-products. Stick to whole ingredients like meat, poultry, fish, fruits, and vegetables.</p><p>Some dogs do well on grain-free diets. This varies among individuals, meaning it's one more thing to ask your vet about.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Komondor</h2><p>The komondor is a rare breed that may take time and effort to find, but don't let that encourage you to purchase or adopt the first one you find. Rescue dogs of this breed may be tough, though not impossible, to come by so you may need to turn to a breeder if your heart is set on a komondor. It's important to be sure you are getting your dog from a reputable komondor breeder who can provide certificates of health.</p><p>You will also want to speak with the breeder to determine the personality of your soon-to-be pet to ensure a happy and healthy life for both of you.</p><p>The Komondor Club of America lists breeders who have pledged to abide by the Komondor Club code of ethics, which includes not breeding a dog without an Orthopedic Foundation for Animals registration number, not breeding unregistered dogs, and not shipping puppies before a certain age.

These dogs are generally friendly and affectionate. But like other terriers, they also can be vocal and stubborn, and they are prone to chase and dig.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 12 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 11.5 to 14 pounds (female), 13 to 15.5 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short, wiry</p><p>Coat Color: Blue and tan, grizzle and tan, red, or wheaten; muzzle is usually darker</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Lively, bright, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom</p><h2>Characteristics of the Border Terrier</h2><p>Border terriers typically have quite a loving temperament with their families, and they even do well with children when they have proper training and socialization. These dogs love to play they are smart and moderately trainable, though they can have a strong-willed streak to their personality. </p><h2>History of the Border Terrier</h2><p>The ancestors of the border terrier can be traced back to the Scottish-English border region. The breed is related to the Dandie Dinmont and the Bedlington terrier, which are also from that area. </p><p>In the 19th century, farmers in this region wanted a dog that was athletic, brave, intelligent, and driven to help catch and deter foxes that were a threat to their sheep. The terriers had to have long legs to keep up on the hunt but small bodies that would allow them to burrow into a fox's den and flush it out. The larger foxhounds in the area were not able to do this.</p><p>The Kennel Club of the U.K. first recognized the breed in 1920, and the American Kennel Club recognized it in 1930. Today it is a moderately popular dog breed in the United States and still quite popular in the U.K.</p><h2>Border Terrier Care</h2><p>Border terriers need quite a bit of exercise and playtime to be happy and healthy. They also require consistent training and socialization to be well-mannered dogs. Their grooming is fairly easy, though it becomes more involved during their shedding season.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least a half hour to an hour of exercise per day for a border terrier. They generally love brisk walks, jogging, hikes, and playing fetch. These athletic canines also excel in dog sports, including agility, flyball, and tracking. These sports will provide excellent mental stimulation as well as physical activity.</p><p>Always keep your dog on a leash or in a secure area for exercise. Because of their high prey drive, border terriers will quickly take off chasing their quarry. Likewise, because these terriers are skilled diggers, make sure any fencing extends underground deep enough that they can't get under it.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Border terriers are fairly low shedders with a wiry outer coat and a soft undercoat. A weekly brushing should suffice most of the time to remove any loose fur and distribute oils. But these dogs will typically go through periods of higher shedding twice a year, often in the spring and fall. During this time, you'll have to manually strip the loose fur from the coat on a daily basis with a rake or special stripping tool.</p><p>The coat of border terriers is naturally effective at repelling dirt, and baths can actually hinder this ability. So only very occasional baths might be required. Otherwise, you can clean your dog with a damp towel followed by brushing.</p><p>Check your dog's nails roughly once a month to see whether they need trimming. And look in its ears at least every week to make sure there's no dirt, debris, redness, inflammation, or other abnormalities. Finally, aim to brush your dog's teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Border terriers are bright and eager to please. That makes them adept at learning obedience commands. But they also can be independent thinkers and stubborn about when they want to obey.</p><p>Begin training your border terrier as early as possible, as it's generally easier to form good habits in puppies than break bad habits in adults. Start with a puppy obedience class as soon as you're able. Always use positive training methods; harsh corrections can cause a dog to shut down and not learn. Also, it's key to be consistent with your directions.</p><p>Introduce your dog to different people, other dogs, and various environments, starting as young as possible. These dogs typically are adaptable and open to meeting people and even other dogs, especially if they've had positive experiences from a young age. However, their strong prey drive can make them poor companions for other household pets, including cats.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Border terriers are typically a healthy and hardy dog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Feed your border terrier a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet, and always have fresh water available. Most owners feed two measured meals per day. The type of diet and quantity can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. So discuss this with your vet to make sure you're providing proper nutrition. Also, remember to factor treats and other extra food into your dog's daily intake to prevent overeating. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Border Terrier</h2><p>Contact local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups to find a border terrier in need of a home.

This breed originated to protect property and livestock, and it tends to be quite loyal to its family. It also can be strong-willed and independent. As such, it's often not the best choice for a first-time dog owner, as well as someone who doesn't have a home with ample space.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 23 to 30 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 99 to 170 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Agouti and white, black and gray, cream, fawn, gray, grizzle, red, rust, sable, or white with/without white markings, piebald, or brindle markings</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 12 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, courageous, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Europe/Asia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Caucasian Shepherd</h2><p>Caucasian shepherds generally have a very watchful and protective personality. Their breeding as a guardian plays a huge role in their temperament. They are typically wary of strangers but are devoted to their family.</p><h2>History of the Caucasian Shepherd</h2><p>Dogs resembling the Caucasian shepherd have existed in the mountainous Caucasus region of Europe and Asia for centuries. They historically were used to guard property and livestock against trespassers and predators, such as wolves and bears. </p><p>The look of these dogs varied depending on the exact region they were from. And there are still two varieties within the breed: the Mountain type (heavier body and longer coat) and the Steppe type (lighter body and shorter coat). </p><p>Soviet breeders began selective breeding among these dogs in the early 1900s. Some of the qualities they wanted to breed for included strength, confidence, good hearing and eyesight, and a weather-proof coat. The breed still remains relatively rare, especially in North America. It's part of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service, which keeps breeding records of purebred development. <br/></p><h2>Caucasian Shepherd Care</h2><p>Caucasian shepherds don't need an excessive amount of exercise, but they do require early and consistent training and socialization. Their grooming is fairly straightforward but can be a time commitment due to their large size.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim to provide your dog with at least an hour of exercise per day via walks, romping around a yard, hikes, playing fetch, and other activities. Puzzle toys can help to burn some mental energy, as well. While this isn't a high-energy breed, it still tends to have good endurance if you like taking long walks or hikes. Be sure always to keep your Caucasian shepherd on a leash or in a securely fenced area due to its protective nature and consequent potential for aggression toward strangers and even other dogs. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Coat length can vary for the Caucasian shepherd. If your dog has a shorter coat, you'll likely only have to brush it once or twice a week. But longer coats might require up to daily brushing to keep up with the loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Expect seasonal periods of higher shedding, often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to increase your brushing. </p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. And check its nails monthly to see whether they need a trim. Also, look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and other abnormalities. And brush its teeth every day.</p><p>Furthermore, this breed has a fairly high drooling level. So you'll likely need to keep a towel handy to clean up drool on your dog's fur, the floor, furniture, and any other spots where it might reach.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The Caucasian shepherd is intelligent, but it also can be stubborn and strong-willed when it comes to training. Start both training and socialization from as young of an age as possible when the dog is at a more manageable size.</p><p>Always use positive training methods. And be consistent in your commands, so your dog learns it can't get away with bad behavior. Owners who are new to the breed often will benefit from consulting with professional dog trainers and behaviorists to help with training and socialization and quell the breed's protective instinct that can lead to aggression when unchecked. <br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide your dog with fresh water. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. One made for large breeds can be ideal, and it's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But you should always discuss both the type of food and the amount with your vet. Also, monitor treats and other extra food to prevent overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Caucasian Shepherd</h2><p>Caucasian shepherds are rare but not impossible to find in North America. So it's worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups to find a dog in need of a home. If possible, get your name on a breed wait list at these organizations. For a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $3,000, though this can vary widely.</p><h2>Caucasian Shepherd Overview</h2><p>Loyal to family</p><p>Typically not a problem barker</p><p>Excellent guard dog</p><p>Can become aggressive if not properly trained</p><p>Needs a lot of space</p><p>High shedder and drooler</p>",836

The most notable feature of the breed is the short tail, sometimes referred to as a ""pom"" by breed enthusiasts. Resulting from a natural gene mutation, it can be straight, bent, or kinked, but it most often resembles a bunny's bushy tail.</p><p>These cats are good-natured and playful, making them ideal house pets. They are avid hunters (toys included) and intelligent enough to learn tricks. With a breed history stretching back thousands of years, the Japanese bobtail as we know it today is a common sight in Japan. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, friendly, sociable, and playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 10 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 14 inches long</p><p>Coat Length: Short or long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: White, black, chocolate, cream, red, lilac, and blue</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, bicolor, tricolor, tabby</p><p>Eye Color: Any shade, though blue and gold are common as well as odd-eyes</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 18 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Japan</p><h2>Japanese Bobtail Characteristics</h2><p>Japanese bobtails are sociable and agreeable cats. They enjoy the company of human companions but also get along with other cats and dogs. They're adaptable to a wide variety of home environments but should be kept as indoor pets for their safety and well-being.</p><p>Breed enthusiasts find Japanese bobtails to be quick learners. They are generally soft-spoken but will vocalize when spoken to. Most bobtails are playful, and some will fetch and carry toys in their mouths like canine retrievers.</p><h2>History of the Japanese Bobtail</h2><p>The Japanese bobtail is an ancient cat breed commonly traced to Japan. These cats are a common sight in the country today and played a pivotal role in Japan's silk trade as far back as the 1600s.</p><p>However, the origin of the Japanese bobtail is shrouded in mystery. Many experts contend that this cat originated in China or Korea at least a thousand years ago. Some sources believe that the Emperor of China gifted these bobtail cats to the Emperor of Japan in the 7<sup>th</sup>century. Others suggest that Buddhist monks were the first to bring bobtail cats into Japan as a means of protecting rice paper scrolls from rats.</p><p>In either case, history suggests that the cats were released at the order of the Japanese emperor in the year 1602 to eradicate rodents that were threatening Japan's silk trade. It was illegal to sell or keep the bobtails as pets, and as a result, these felines became common street cats in Japan.</p><p>The breed frequently appears in ancient paintings and is commonly represented in popular Japanese figurines of a white cat with one paw raised called ""the Beckoning Cat."" Even a popular cartoon character, Hello Kitty, is believed to be a Japanese bobtail though no official breed declaration has been made by Sarnio, the character's creator.</p><p>The Japanese bobtail was first introduced to the United States in the 1960s. The cats gained attention for their interactive personalities and unique appearance. A woman named Elizabeth Freret is credited with importing the first Japanese bobtails in 1968. Within a decade, the shorthair variation of the breed was accepted by the Cat Fancier's Association (CFA) for championship status. The long-haired variation of the Japanese bobtail received champion status in 1993, and today both breeds are CFA-recognized. </p><h2>Japanese Bobtail Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>With no undercoat, the smooth, silky fur of the Japanese bobtail is easy to maintain. Both long and short hair varieties will benefit from a weekly brushing to remove loose hair and promote circulation and shine.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like most cats, Japanese bobtails thrive in an environment with daily human companionship. They don't have high energy levels or exercise needs, but they enjoy games, including fetch, and can be taught many tricks. Of course, they also love to curl up for a cat nap on a warm lap.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>There are very few health problems commonly associated with this cat breed. In general, the Japanese bobtail is considered to be very healthy and not overly prone to any particular disorder or disease.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Japanese bobtail is sometimes confused with the Manx. However, you can distinguish the difference between the two breeds by looking at a cat's body structure. Manx are typically more robust, with heavier bones and rounder features. The Japanese bobtail, on the other hand, has a more svelte frame and muscular appearance. The triangular head of the Japanese bobtail also helps to distinguish it from the rounder head of the Manx.<br/></p><p>The Japanese bobtail may have either a short or long-haired coat in a wide array of colors, including solid, tabby, and bi-color. Tri-color Bobtails are also common and are referred to as ""mi-ke."" The mi-ke coat can be a typical calico (a tri-color combination of red, white, and brown) or many other color combinations including chocolate, lilac, and smoke colors. <br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Japanese bobtails don't require any special diet or feeding regimens. What they do need, however, is quality cat food and a well-balanced diet. It's important not to let one of the cat's greatest enemies, obesity, creep into the picture through over-feeding or too many treats.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Japanese Bobtail</h2><p>Adopting or buying a Japanese bobtail can be challenging. Breeders are still relatively rare in the United States, and these cats are known to have very small litters usually just two to four kittens. If you have your heart set on a Japanese bobtail, expect to spend time on a waiting list and pay upwards of $1,000, depending on coat color and markings.</p><p>Start your search with these online resources;</p><p>Learn more about the Japanese bobtail through the National Breed Club, or by speaking with breeders and owners who are passionate about the breed.</p><h2>Japanese Bobtail Overview</h2><p>The Japanese bobtail is a small cat with a cute ""bunny"" tail that has long been revered in Japan. Today, the bobtail makes a great pet for single owners and families alike. It is friendly and adaptable, and it enjoys time spent with humans.

Its dense double-coat consists of a thick undercoat and a short, weather-resistant overcoat. The blue heeler is known as hard-working, intelligent, and loyal to its owner. Historically, these dogs were bred to work on farms as herders, and they still thrive when they have a job to do. Their fierce loyalty makes them even better workers. Even if you don't work on a farm, you can put them to work they love, such as figuring out puzzles and retrieving toys.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 35 to 50 pounds</p><p>COAT: Dense double coat</p><p>COLOR: Blue-gray with speckles</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 16 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, active, intelligent</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Australia</p><p><br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Blue Heeler</h2><p>Beyond having an unwavering work ethic, blue heelers become intensely devoted to their owners and dislike being separated from them, which is why they are known as ""shadow dogs."" This is an extremely active dog that will happily become your next running or hiking buddy.</p><h2>History of the Blue Heeler</h2><p>The blue heeler was bred to herd cattle by Australian settlers during the 19th century. The breed is largely credited for using its expertise to help ranchers efficiently expand the Australian beef industry.</p><p>After many breedings and cross-breedings, ranchers developed a solid and strong canine who could handle Australia's harsh climate. Dogs brought to Australia from England were bred with the native Australian dingo to create the ancestors of the blue heeler, or Australian cattle dog, that you know today.</p><p>In May 1980 the Australian cattle dog was accepted for registration by the American Kennel Club. The breed became eligible for show in the Working Group in September of that year and was transferred to the Herding Group in 1983.</p><h2>Blue Heeler Care</h2><p>If a blue heeler does not get an outlet for its energy, it may become bored and destructive by chewing on shoes or furniture. This breed loves living in homes with a fenced yard or a safe property to run in. In addition, blue heelers don't like to be left alone for long periods, especially in small spaces, so bring your pal along when going for a walk, hike, or swim.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Exercise is a critical part of a blue heeler's life. Because of their hardworking heritage, the breed craves at least 30 minutes of regular physical exercise a day. A walk plus multiple games of fetch will tire out your blue heeler. This breed also needs at least 30 minutes a day of mental stimulation, so have a variety of puzzles, chews, and tug toys to help your dog stay satisfied.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Blue heelers are not high maintenance. Bathe them as necessary, trim their nails once a month, brush their teeth, and clean their ears on occasion to promote wellness.</p><p>Their two-layered coats do need extra attention during times of the year when they do a lot of shedding, for example during the spring when they shed their winter coat. During this time, it's important to brush your blue heeler frequently, sometimes multiple times a day, to remove dead hair. You'll need an undercoat rake or comb to do the best job.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>The blue heeler is easy to train because they are intelligent and energetic. They will herd everything and anything that moves, including children and other pets. For this reason, blue heelers need early socialization and training to understand which behaviors are unacceptable. If early training is neglected, they may nip at running kids or play too rough with other animals.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Blue heelers are powerful and athletic dogs. As such, their joints and ligaments can undergo some wear and tear. Tearing of the dog's cruciate ligament is always a concern and any signs of limping or pain should be checked out right away with a veterinarian.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Being such active dogs, it is very important to provide proper nutrition for your blue heeler pup, and to ensure they are taking in enough calories to keep up with their active lifestyles. Most commercial dog food diets will have an adequate balance of nutrients for dogs who spend most of their time as companions.</p><p>For blue heelers that are true working dogs or spend hours sprinting and running, they may benefit from performance diets suited to their specific needs as working dogs. As they become older, you may find it beneficial to switch to a canned food diet or to soak their kibble before feeding it to them which can be easier on older dogs with fewer teeth. Since these dogs are so active and we want to promote healthy joints, look for foods with glucosamine and chondroitin added, or consider adding on a good joint supplement.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Blue Heeler</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and rescue groups for blue heelers in need of homes. If you are adopting an older blue heeler into a family with children, check to see if the dog was trained or socialized.</p><p>Australian Cattle Dog Rescue Association</p><p>Australian Cattle Dog Rescue, Inc.</p><p>Australian Cattle Dog Club of America</p><h2>Blue Heeler Overview</h2><p>Hard-working</p><p>Intelligent and curious</p><p>Loyal and eager to please</p><p>Requires intense mental and physical stimulation or may become bored and destructive</p><p>Does not like being left behind; wants to be with its owner at all times</p><p>Can be stubborn</p>",864

The dog's ears are medium-length and hang down, and its eyes are usually brown or hazel. Its skin lacks the droopiness and folds of many other hound dog breeds, such as the bloodhound. Overall, it has a muscular build with long legs that give it both speed and stamina. The Plott hound is generally loyal and eager to please, and it can be a dedicated and fearless hunting dog. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 20 to 23 inches (female), 20 to 25 inches (male)<br/></p><p>Weight: 40 to 55 pounds (female), 50 to 60 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Any shade of brindle, black, buckskin, or maltese with/without black saddle, gray muzzle and jaw, white chest and feet, or brindle trim</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, alert, active</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Plott Hound</h2><p>Plott hounds generally have a devoted and protective temperament with their family, though they can be wary of strangers. With proper socialization they can get along with other dogs, but they might view smaller household pets as prey. High energy also helps to shape this breed's personality, and it prefers an active lifestyle.</p><h2>History of the Plott Hound</h2><p>Unlike many hound breeds that have their roots in the United Kingdom, the Plott hound has German ancestors. In the mid-1700s a German named Johannes Plott came to North Carolina with five Hanover hounds, a German dog breed that's known for its impeccable nose. <br/></p><p>The Plott family used these dogs to hunt big game, such as wild boar and bears. And they eventually bred their Hanover hounds with local hunting dogs, which allowed the Plott hound to take shape. The breed is known not only for its scent hound abilities but also its loud, musical bay that can be heard over a great distance.<br/></p><p>As of 1989, the breed is the state dog of North Carolina. The American Kennel Club first recognized it in 2006.</p><h2>Plott Hound Care</h2><p>Plott hounds are smart and energetic, which means they need lots of daily activity to be happy and well-adjusted. Their grooming requirements are basic. And they should receive training and socialization from an early age.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to give your dog at least one to two hours of vigorous exercise every day. A bored Plott hound without an outlet for its energy might become destructive or engage in other undesirable behaviors. Long walks, running, cycling, and play sessions all are great ways to burn some of this breed's energy. Plus, dog sports, such as tracking and agility, can provide mental and physical challenges. And puzzle toys can help to provide mental stimulation, as well.</p><p>Make sure to keep your Plott hound on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. The breed's high prey drive can cause it to take off running after perceived prey, and your dog might not always listen to your recall commands.<br/><br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Plott hound's short coat stays relatively clean and only needs basic grooming. Brush weekly with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Shedding can increase seasonally, often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to brush more frequently to keep up with the loose fur.</p><p>Bathe your dog every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. But make sure to check its ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning, as wax and debris can build up especially in pendant dog ears. Also, dry the ears well whenever they get wet. In addition, check your dog's nails roughly once a month to see whether they're due for a trim. And aim to brush its teeth every day with a canine toothpaste.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Plott hounds can be somewhat stubborn when it comes to training. Begin training and socialization ideally when your dog is a puppy to prevent bad habits from forming. Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. And try to keep training sessions fun and varied to hold your dog's attention.</p><p>In addition, aim to expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations from a young age. Having lots of positive experiences can help to curb its wariness of strangers. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Overall, the Plott hound is a healthy dog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your Plott Hound. And feed it a high-quality diet with balanced nutrition. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to make sure your dog is getting the proper amount. Always discuss both the quantity and type of food with your vet to ensure that you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Diets can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Plott Hound</h2><p>The Plott hound isn't an exceptionally common dog breed, but it is still possible to find one available for adoption. So check your local animal shelters, and see whether there are any breed-specific rescue groups in your area as well. For a puppy from a responsible breeder, expect to pay around $300 to $700 on average.</p><h2>Plott Hound Overview</h2><p>Good running companion</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>Generally loyal and loving with family</p><p>Requires rigorous daily exercise and mental stimulation</p><p>Not suitable for apartments</p><p>High prey drive</p>",874

Mixed breed cats as well as some pure breeds can possess the tuxedo pattern. Any piebald combination of black-and-white qualifies as a tuxedo cat, but the most striking examples have a black body with a white chest and paws. Sometimes, a black spot at the throat will even resemble a bow tie!<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Tuxie, Felix cat, Jellicle cat, piebald</p><p>Personality: Varies with breed</p><p>Weight: Up to 18 pounds, depending on breed</p><p>Length: Up to 36 inches, nose to tail, depending on breed</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair, long hair, or curly</p><p>Coat Colors: Black and white</p><p>Coat Patterns: Bicolor</p><p>Eye Color: Various shades of gold, green, or blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No (the Sphynx and Devon Rex breeds are less allergenic)</p><p>Origin: Ancient Egypt<br/></p><h2>Tuxedo Cat Characteristics</h2><p>Tuxedo is a coloration pattern that can occur in many different cat breeds. The tuxedo pattern is named after the attire human men wear for formal occasions. Nothing is so dramatic as seeing a ""tuxie,"" as it is affectionately called, dressed in its best bib and tucker. Some tuxies also wear ""spats,"" or white boots. </p><p>Other variations on the tuxedo theme include a white striped nose and the ""masked tuxedo,"" with white around the chin and nose or white tips on the nose. Another variation infamously called the ""Kitler"" features a white ""mustache.""</p><p>Because many breeds and mixed breeds can sport the tuxedo pattern, the personalities of tuxedo cats vary much more widely than their coloration. The temperament of the individual cat will depend on its genetics and the environment in which it is raised.</p><h2>History of the Tuxedo Cat</h2><p>Cats have color genes that can produce the tuxedo pattern in the right combination. Tuxedo cats have the genes to be black. They also have the white spotting gene, which masks the black color on some parts of the body. It does this by preventing the color-producing melanocytes from migrating to those areas. The spotting gene produces different grades of white spotting, from 1 to 10. Tuxedo cats fall into the low grades from 1 to 4. The lower the number, the less white is seen.</p><p>No one knows for sure when this gene combination began to be expressed in cats, but it is thought to date back at least to the ancient Egyptians, as bicolor cats have been identified in their tombs. Tuxedo cats appear throughout modern popular culture.</p><h2>Tuxedo Cat Care</h2><p>The individualized care of a tuxedo cat will depend on its breed. Its coat requires no special treatment based on color pattern. Brushing your cat will help reduce matting and may help prevent hairballs. Trim your cat's nails every two to three weeks and provide a scratching post. Also, as with any cat, stay up-to-date on veterinary visits and vaccinations to help prevent health problems.</p><p>Give your cat plenty of chances to play and chase toys, and offer safe places to retreat. Cats like lots of sleep and cat naps, so provide a comfortable bed and other places around your living area where your cat can lounge.</p><p>Indoor cats will need a litter box in a quiet area. Be sure to completely dump and clean the box at least once a week. Using clumping litter and scooping out the clumps daily can keep things tidy.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Tuxedo cats can be many different breeds, some of which are more prone to particular diseases and conditions.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>You will know whether a cat has the tuxedo pattern from birth. Kittens are simply miniatures of the adult pattern rather than having a changing color pattern as they grow up. These black-and-white beauties come in all shapes and sizes, but they always look a little more sophisticated than their counterparts because of their tidy tux-like markings. While gray cats may bear a similar bicolor pattern, they are not generally considered tuxedo cats.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your tuxedo cat should be fed the same diet as any other cat of its breed. While it may be dressed to the nines, your cat doesn't need to dine on caviar. A wet food diet is often considered best, but you can leave out dry food for your cat to snack on as well. Discuss your cat's needs with your veterinarian, especially if your cat has diabetes, is obese, or is a senior. Provide fresh, clean water for your cat at all times.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Tuxedo Cat</h2><p>Mixed breed tuxedo cats are fairly common and may be found in adoption shelters, but the pure breeds that bear the black-and-white pattern must be sourced from breeders. Check the American Cat Fanciers' Association (ACFA) breed directory for reputable breeders in the United States.</p><h2>Types of Tuxedo Cat</h2><h2>Tuxedo Cat Overview</h2><p>Maybe you're looking for a boldly colored shelter cat or a specific breed in black-and-white or perhaps you've found a stray kitten that appears to be wearing a formal suit.

They can make for very gentle and loving companions. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 23.5 to 26.5 inches (female), 24.5 to 27.5 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 55 pounds (female), 60 to 65 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth or rough</p><p>Coat Color: Can be any color; usually fawn, brindle, black, chestnut, cinnamon, red, or white with/without white markings</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, calm, even-tempered</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Spain<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Spanish Galgo</h2><p>The Galgo generally has a laid-back personality and is friendly with people, including children. Galgos also typically get along with other dogs and sometimes cats, but they might view smaller animals as prey. A moderate energy level also helps to shape this breed's temperament, making it a good dog for those who like to be active but also curl up on the couch.</p><h2>History of the Spanish Galgo</h2><p>They were highly prized for their hunting abilities, making the dogs a favorite among the nobility. Ancient Spanish artwork also depicts Galgos hunting with their owners. The Galgo is even mentioned in the famous Spanish novel ""Don Quixote.""</p><p>Spanish Galgos remain rare around the world today. The United Kennel Club first recognized the Galgo in 2006. The American Kennel Club does not yet recognize the breed.</p><h2>Spanish Galgo Care</h2><p>Meet a Galgo's exercise needs each day, and it usually will be an easygoing household companion. Grooming is fairly easy for this dog. And training and socialization should ideally begin at a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least one to two hours each day exercising your Galgo via long walks, running, hiking, cycling, vigorous games of fetch, and more. Puzzle toys can help your dog burn some mental energy. Dog sports, such as tracking, are a great way to provide mental stimulation and physical activity.</p><p>It's ideal that a Galgo has a securely fenced area where it can run freely at its own speed to burn energy. But avoid letting a Galgo off leash outside in an unfenced area, as its hunting instincts might kick in and cause it to take off chasing perceived prey. </p><p>Moreover, the short coat of a Galgo doesn't provide much protection against cold weather. So consider a dog coat or sweater in the cold, and try to keep outdoor sessions relatively short.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Galgos only require basic grooming. Brush weekly to remove loose fur either with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt. You might notice an uptick in shedding in the fall and spring, during which you'll have to brush more frequently. </p><p>Plan on a bath around every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Trim your dog's nails roughly every month as well. And check its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. Finally, aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>It's best to begin training and socialization when your Galgo is a puppy to instill good manners. Galgos tend to respond well to positive training techniques; harsh corrections can cause this sensitive breed to shut down and refuse to learn. Put some extra focus on recall training, so you'll ideally be able to call your dog back if it begins to chase perceived prey. </p><p>Galgos can be shy and reserved around strangers, though they don't have a tendency toward aggression. Try to give your dog lots of positive experiences around different people and in various places to help boost its comfort and confidence. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Because Galgos are rare, not much is known about the breed's potential hereditary health issues.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your Galgo. Feed it a high-quality canine diet that's nutritionally balanced. Always discuss both the type of diet and the amount with your vet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But Galgos can be prone to bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twisting if they eat too quickly. So you might want to feed smaller, more frequent meals or use a special feeder that slows down their eating. Also, avoid exercising your dog right before and after a meal. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Spanish Galgo</h2><p>The Spanish Galgo is a rare dog breed, especially in North America. It is difficult to find a reputable breeder, and you likely won't find a Galgo at a local animal shelter. </p><p>There has been much controversy over hunters in Spain abusing Galgos and then leaving them to die once they're no longer useful. Rescue organizations worldwide have attempted to intervene in this and save the dogs.</p><h2>Spanish Galgo Overview</h2><p>Typically gentle and loving</p><p>Can be a good family pet</p><p>Doesn't need a high amount of exercise</p><p>High prey drive</p><p>Doesn't tolerate cold well</p><p>Difficult to find a breeder or rescue group</p>",830

Overall, the dog has a well-balanced and light build. Its large, round eyes peek out from behind the shaggy fur on its face, which also grows into a mustache and beard. And its downward-hanging ears are fairly small but covered in feathering. The dog's long tail also has ample feathering. The breed is built for springy movements, which serves it well as a herding dog. And it does best with an active owner.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 16 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 26 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Beige, black, black and white, brown, gray, gray and white, white, chocolate and white, or tricolored</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, bright, attentive</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Netherlands</p><h2>Characteristics of the Schapendoes</h2><p>The schapendoes generally has a friendly and upbeat personality. The breed tends to be very devoted to its family, though it can be slightly reserved around strangers. High energy and a playful nature also help to shape the breed's temperament.</p><h2>History of the Schapendoes</h2><p>The origin of the schapendoes is unclear. The breed is thought to have existed throughout the Netherlands for centuries. It's likely related to similar breeds, including the bearded collie, puli, Briard, Polish lowland sheepdog, and Bergamasco.</p><p>Schapendoezen have been valuable companions for shepherds in the Netherlands due to their strong work ethic and high intelligence. Plus, they were friendly and devoted family companions. The breed nearly disappeared around the time of World War II, but the remaining dogs were gathered to keep it alive. </p><p>The schapendoes breed club in the Netherlands was founded in 1947, and shortly thereafter breeding began to be logged. In 2005, the American Kennel Club admitted the schapendoes to its Foundation Stock Service, which also helps to document breeding. And the breed received the Herding group designation. It still remains rare around the world today.</p><h2>Schapendoes Care</h2><p>Plan to give your schapendoes lots of daily exercise. Plus, this breed's grooming needs are fairly straightforward, though they do require some dedication. Fortunately, it typically takes well to training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim to give your schapendoes at least two hours of exercise per day to keep it happy and healthy. Long walks, running, cycling, hiking, and vigorous games of fetch all are ideal activities. This breed also can excel in dog sports, including agility and herding trials, which will help to challenge it physically and mentally. Some dogs that don't receive enough exercise might become overly vocal or destructive in the house, so it's important to have enough time for this energetic breed.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog at least one to two times per week to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. This breed's thick coat is prone to matting, especially in the areas with feathering. So thorough grooming is a necessity. Also, expect periods of higher shedding seasonally as the weather changes, during which you'll likely have to brush more frequently to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your schapendoes roughly once a month, depending on how dirty it gets. But see whether its ears need cleaning at least weekly. Also, see whether it needs a nail trim about every month, and attempt to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed is known to be eager to please, so training is typically an easy process. Begin both training and socialization from a young age to prevent any bad habits from forming. A puppy class can be ideal both to teach basic obedience and manners. Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as praise and treats. And keep training sessions fun and varied to hold this intelligent dog's attention. </p><p>Furthermore, to help quell the breed's reserved nature around strangers, aim to expose your dog to different people and various locations starting when it's a puppy. Having lots of positive experiences can help with a dog's social skills.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The schapendoes is a healthy dog breed overall. It is not prone to any known hereditary health issues. However, any dog might be affected by common health problems related to aging, such as arthritis.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed your schapendoes a high-quality canine diet with balanced nutrition. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure that your dog gets the right amount. Be sure to discuss both the type of food and the quantity with your vet, as individual needs can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Schapendoes</h2><p>The schapendoes is a rare breed, but that doesn't mean it's impossible to find. Check local animal shelters and rescue groups, and see whether you can get your name on a breed wait list. Breeders also might be difficult to come by depending on where you live, and you might have to wait some time for a dog to be available.

These dogs sport upright ears, almond-shaped eyes, a wrinkled forehead, and a tail that curls over their back. Overall, they have a square, athletic build. <br/></p><p>Basenjis are nicknamed the ""barkless dog."" Instead of a typical canine bark, they make a yodel-like sound among other vocalizations due to the shape of their vocal cords. But even though they're relatively quiet, they still require lots of exercise and mental stimulation. They do best with active owners. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 16 inches (female), 17 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 22 pounds (female), 24 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Black and white; black, tan, and white; brindle and white; or red and white with/without brindle markings</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Independent, intelligent, quiet</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Democratic Republic of the Congo</p><h2>Characteristics of the Basenji</h2><p>Basenjis are said to have a catlike personality. They can be fairly independent and aloof, especially around strangers, and tend to pick out favorite family members. They also will groom themselves like a cat. High energy and intelligence shape their personality, and they can become bored quickly.</p><h2>History of the Basenji</h2><p>The basenji is an ancient dog breed. In fact, some of the first domesticated dogs resembled the basenji. Its likeness appears on ancient Egyptian artifacts, as well as Babylonian and Mesopotamian artwork. </p><p>These ancestors of the modern basenji survived as semi-feral dogs in remote locations of Africa for centuries. And thus the breed remained largely unchanged due to the lack of crossbreeding. People in and around what's now the Democratic Republic of the Congo trained basenjis to be their hunting dogs. They prized these canines for their acute eyesight and sense of smell, intelligence, fearlessness, and athleticism. </p><p>It wasn't until the early 1900s that basenjis arrived in the United States, and breeding programs took off slowly. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1944, but it still isn't common to see in North America.</p><h2>Basenji Care</h2><p>Fortunately, the basenji's grooming needs are minimal. But early and consistent training and socialization are important for a well-mannered dog. Plan to spend considerable time each day exercising your basenji.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Basenjis should get at least a couple hours of exercise per day. When they don't burn their high levels of mental and physical energy, they might engage in destructive behavior, such as unwanted chewing. Long walks, running, hiking, and exuberant play sessions all are ideal ways to exercise a basenji. Plus, they can excel in dog sports, including agility and tracking.</p><p>Always keep a basenji on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outside. These dogs have a high prey drive and can quickly run off chasing small animals and other perceived prey when given the chance. They also are adept at climbing fences especially fencing in which they can get a foothold, such as chain link. So make sure your fence is high and solid enough to contain them.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your basenji's coat weekly using a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. This will help to keep the coat fairly clean. Basenjis generally don't need frequent baths unless they become dirty. But check your dog's ears at least weekly for dirt, wax buildup, and other abnormalities. In addition, check its nails monthly to see whether they need a trim. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Even though they are highly intelligent, basenjis can be stubborn when it comes to training. This is largely due to their independent personality and sometimes mischievous nature. They might perfectly understand commands but simply choose not to follow them.</p><p>Start training from an early age to help give your dog a well-mannered foundation and prevent bad habits from forming. Always use positive-reinforcement training, and be consistent in your commands; don't let bad behavior slide. Also, keep training sessions short and varied, so your dog doesn't lose interest. </p><p>Furthermore, begin socializing your basenji from a young age. These dogs are usually reserved around strangers, but they can warm up with lots of positive experiences around people. They are moderately good with other dogs but might perceive any smaller household pets, including cats, as prey.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Overall, this is a healthy dog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Make sure fresh water is available to your dog at all times. Feed your basenji a quality canine diet with balanced nutrition. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day, but always discuss both the type of food and the amount with your veterinarian. Your dog's individual needs might vary depending on its age, size, activity level, and other factors. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Basenji</h2><p>Basenjis aren't a very common breed, but it's still worth checking animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home.

Bred as a big game hunter, the Dogo is athletic, courageous, and intelligent. It requires lots of exercise every day. It's also a watchful guardian but tends to be very affectionate with its family. Still, this dog breed is typically not ideal for first-time dog owners, as it requires careful and consistent training and socialization. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 24 to 25.5 inches (female), 24 to 26.5 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 80 to 100 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: White</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 9 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, fearless, energetic</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Argentina</p><h2>Characteristics of the Dogo Argentino</h2><p>The Dogo Argentino tends to have a loving and loyal temperament with its family, but it can be wary of strangers. The high prey drive part of its personality often makes it a poor match for other household pets, especially smaller animals. Overall, this is a smart and athletic dog breed that needs a lot of daily activity.</p><h2>History of the Dogo Argentino</h2><p>The Dogo Argentino can trace its roots back to Argentina in 1928. A doctor named Antonio Nores Martinez wanted to create a dog that was suitable for big game hunting, as well as a good watchdog and family companion.</p><p>To create the Dogo, Martinez crossed the now-extinct Cordoba fighting dog with mastiffs, bulldogs, bull terriers, and boxers. Other breeds that contributed their genes were the Great Dane, Irish wolfhound, and English pointer.</p><p>The breed arrived in the United States in the 1970s and is still relatively rare. The American Kennel Club first recognized it in 2020.</p><h2>Dogo Argentino Care</h2><p>Due to their high energy, Dogos need vigorous exercise every day. They also should receive consistent training and socialization starting in puppyhood. Grooming is fairly straightforward for these dogs, though they do require sun protection.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Dogo Argentino needs a minimum of 60 minutes of daily exercise. Brisk walks are good, but to really tire out your Dogo, allow it to run freely in a secure area. Try a spirited game of fetch or dog sports, such as agility, obedience, or weight pull. Not only will this challenge the Dogo physically, but it also will allow your dog to burn some mental energy. Always keep your dog on leash when you're out and about, as the high prey drive of Dogos can cause them to take off quickly if they're not restrained.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Dogo Argentino's smooth, short coat sheds a moderate amount. It also doesn't typically have much of a doggie odor. Brush weekly with a soft bristle brush or rubber curry brush to remove loose hair and distribute oils. The occasional bath when the dog becomes dirty is usually all that's necessary.</p><p>Check your dog's ears at least weekly for any dirt, debris, redness, or other abnormalities. Your vet can show you how to properly clean the ears. Also, check your dog's nails roughly once a month to see whether they need a trim. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><p>Furthermore, like other dogs with short, white fur, the Dogo Argentino is susceptible to sunburn. Be mindful of how much time your dog spends in direct sunlight, and discuss sun protection with your vet.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Aim to start training and socialization as young as possible with a Dogo Argentino. These dogs can be difficult to manage if they are ill-mannered, big, and strong adults. </p><p>This breed needs a self-assured owner who is consistent about using positive training methods. Harsh corrections can hinder learning. Enroll in a puppy obedience class as soon as your dog is old enough. And expose it to different people, other dogs, and various situations to build its comfort and confidence. The more a Dogo has positive experiences with new people and dogs, the likelier it will be that the Dogo is friendly with them rather than defensive.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Dogo Argentino is typically a very healthy breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure fresh water is available for your dog, and provide a nutritionally balanced canine diet. Like other large breeds, the Dogo Argentino can benefit from eating a large-breed puppy formula. This will provide the proper nutrition to promote slow, steady growth and help prevent joint issues.</p><p>Most owners feed two measured meals per day. Discuss the type of diet and how much your dog needs to eat with your veterinarian, as this can vary by age, size, activity level, and other factors. Also, be mindful about treats and other extra food to prevent your dog from becoming overweight.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Dogo Argentino</h2><p>The Dogo Argentino is relatively rare in North America. But it's still worth checking area shelters and rescue groups for one in need of a home.

Once these flocks form, the coat is very low-maintenance and barely sheds. Bergamasco sheepdogs are athletic, though they don't require an excessive amount of exercise. But they are happiest when they have a ""job"" to do, such as herding livestock.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 22 inches (female), 23.5 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 57 to 71 pounds (female), 70 to 84 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Long, corded<br/></p><p>COAT COLOR: Black or gray, can have black patches</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 13 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, protective, companionable</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bergamasco Sheepdog</h2><p>Bergamasco sheepdogs tend to have a patient and protective temperament, and they are very devoted to their work. They generally are loyal and loving with their family, though they also have an independent streak to their personality.</p><h2>History of the Bergamasco Sheepdog</h2><p>The exact origin of the Bergamasco sheepdog is unknown, but it has lived in and around the Italian city of Bergamo for centuries. Its ancestors were possibly Middle Eastern dog breeds that were used as barter in the region. </p><p>These hardy dogs were well suited for the harsh terrain of the Alps as they herded and guarded livestock. Their flocked coat protected them from both the elements and injury. And their exceptionally long upper eyelashes helped to keep hair out of their eyes and prevent snow blindness. These bright dogs learned to work closely with their humans, understanding their job and being independent enough to problem-solve on their own. </p><p>The breed's numbers began to dwindle after World War II, but breed associations worked to keep it alive. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Bergamasco in 2015, and it still is a rare dog breed around the world today. </p><h2>Bergamasco Sheepdog Care</h2><p>Bergamasco sheepdogs should receive a moderate amount of daily exercise, and they require consistent training and socialization. Plus, their unique coat is surprisingly easy to care for as long as you know how to treat it.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These dogs should receive at least an hour of exercise per day via walks, jogging, hiking, playtime, and more. They also enjoy dog sports, such as agility and herding, which can help to exercise both their bodies and their minds. However, swimming is not usually an ideal activity because the water weighs down their flocked coat and impedes movement.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Bergamasco's coat has three different hair types: dog (fairly soft), goat (coarser), and wool (fuzzy). The latter two don't start to come in until the dog matures. </p><p>When the dog reaches its first birthday, the coat must be ""ripped,"" a process that forms the mats, or flocks. This can take a few hours, but it's a one-time process for the dog's life. After that, the flocks will grow and become denser, not requiring brushing and only minimally shedding. It's important to note that while the flocks are technically matted fur, the mats don't go all the way to the skin to cause irritation. </p><p>Baths are only required a few times a year, after which the flocks must be thoroughly dried with fans. Nails should be checked about every month to see whether they need a trim. And it's ideal to brush the dog's teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Early training and socialization are important for this breed to prevent bad habits from forming. These dogs are very intelligent and generally respond well to positive training methods. They usually see their humans as equal partners, rather than ""alphas."" And that sometimes can make them stubborn about training. But as long as you are consistent about your commands and positively reinforce good behavior, they should comply with what you are asking.</p><p>Moreover, it's important to introduce your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations ideally from a young age. This will help to build its comfort and confidence and quell its protective instinct. These dogs tend to be naturally wary of strangers.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Bergamasco sheepdogs are overall a very healthy dog breed. The only hereditary health issue they can be prone to are hip and elbow problems. It's also recommended that breeders proactively test for degenerative myelopathy to keep this spinal cord disease out of the bloodline.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed a high-quality canine diet that's nutritionally balanced. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But be sure to discuss the type of food and the amount with your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs.

If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $2,000, though this can vary widely.

They often bond closely with their family and have a protective streak to their temperament. That personality trait can cause them to be wary around strangers, but they don't tend to bark a lot.</p><h2>History of the Rhodesian Ridgeback</h2><p>The Rhodesian ridgeback breed has its roots in semi-wild dogs native to southern Africa that were crossed with other breeds brought to the area by European settlers starting in the 1600s. Some dog breeds that are included in its makeup are mastiffs, Great Danes, bulldogs, bloodhounds, greyhounds, and terriers. </p><p>In the 1800s, a hunter from Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) used an early version of the ridgeback for big-game hunting. He found the dogs to be fearless in confronting and holding lions and other prey. The dogs also were protective of their property while being devoted and affectionate family companions. </p><p>A breeding program began, and the first breed standard was written in 1922. The American Kennel Club didn't recognize the breed until 1955. Interestingly, one of the first ridgeback breeders in the U.S. was actor Errol Flynn.</p><h2>Rhodesian Ridgeback Care</h2><p>Rhodesian ridgebacks need a dedicated owner who can provide them with daily exercise, as well as consistent training and socialization. These big, powerful dogs can be difficult to handle if they aren't well-mannered. Fortunately, they need little more than basic grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Rhodesian ridgebacks need daily physical activity and mental stimulation to keep them happy and healthy. Provide at least an hour of exercise per day in the form of brisk walks, jogs, hiking, play, and more. This breed also excels at various dog sports, including agility, obedience, and lure coursing. Participating in dog sports not only is a good way for your dog to exercise but also challenge its mind. </p><p>Always keep your ridgeback on a leash or in a secure area when outside. Otherwise, it might take off chasing perceived prey. Many ridgebacks love to dig, so it's important that you have a fence they can't dig under or leap over.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The ridgeback's coat sheds a moderate amount but requires little grooming. Brush weekly to remove loose fur and distribute oils. You might see an increase in shedding in the spring and fall as the weather changes, requiring brushing a few times per week. Bathe your dog roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. Also, check the ears weekly for any dirt, debris, redness, or other abnormalities. </p><p>Look at the nails roughly once a month to see whether they need trimming.

But their independence and strong will can complicate training. Consistency, patience, and positive reinforcement are key. </p><p>Aim to start training when your dog is a puppy, as an adult ridgeback with poor manners can be very difficult to control. Take your dog to obedience classes as soon as it's old enough, and socialize it with different people, dogs, and various environments. Ridgebacks tend to be reserved around strangers, but early and regular socialization can help to boost their comfort and confidence.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Rhodesian ridgebacks are typically a healthy dog breed overall.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide fresh water for your Rhodesian ridgeback. Feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet; most owners feed two measured meals per day. The appropriate amount of food will depend on such factors as age, size, and activity level, so be sure to discuss both the diet and quantity with your veterinarian. </p><p>Also, make sure to factor treats and other extra food into your dog's daily diet to prevent overeating. Thanks to their size, ridgebacks can easily steal food left on tables and counters. So ensure that your food is always secure.</p><p>Furthermore, like other deep-chested dog breeds, ridgebacks can experience bloat and twisting of the stomach. This is often due to eating too quickly. So you might consider feeding smaller, more frequent meals or using a puzzle toy to slowly dispense the food.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Rhodesian Ridgeback</h2><p>Look at local animal shelters, as well as breed-specific rescue groups, for a Rhodesian ridgeback in need of a home.

This hound dog generally makes a loving and loyal companion, and, when it gets enough daily physical activity, it can be quite mellow in the house.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound<br/>HEIGHT: 20 to 25 inches (female), 22 to 27 inches (male)<br/>WEIGHT: 50 to 70 pounds<br/>COAT: Smooth, short</p><p>COAT COLOR: White, black, and tricolor with various markings<br/>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Courageous, loyal, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Treeing Walker Coonhound</h2><p>The treeing walker coonhound typically has a very friendly and affectionate personality. It enjoys the company of people, including kids, and it usually can coexist well with other dogs. Its temperament also is marked by its high energy level and prey drive, which can cause it to be quite vocal at times. </p><h2>History of the Treeing Walker Coonhound</h2><p>The treeing walker coonhound descends from English foxhounds mixed with other hound dogs. Development began in the United States in the mid-1700s, and the breed really started to take shape in the 1800s. </p><p>These dogs were prized for their strong work ethic and ability to swiftly follow a scent on the hunt. They would hold their quarry often a raccoon in a tree until the hunters arrived, signaling to them with their booming voices.</p><p>The dog was classified as an English coonhound until 1945. At that point, the United Kennel Club recognized it as a distinct breed. The American Kennel Club follow suit in 2012.</p><h2>Treeing Walker Coonhound Care</h2><p>As hunting dogs, these dogs have incredible strength, speed, and stamina. They need lots of exercise every day to challenge them both physically and mentally. They also require training and socialization from a young age to be well-mannered dogs. Fortunately, their short coat has minimal grooming needs.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These dogs are best for active owners, as they prefer to exercise with their humans. Provide them with at least one to two hours of physical activity per day. If they don't get enough exercise, they might resort to problem behaviors, such as being excessively vocal or destructive. </p><p>Running and hiking are ideal activities to do with your coonhound, along with an active game of fetch. Dog sports, such as tracking and agility, can help to challenge your dog mentally as well as physically. </p><p>Note that these hounds will quickly take off after a scent when given the chance. So you must either keep them on leash at all times when you're out, or let them loose in a secure area with a high fence. Their ability to chase prey into trees means they can be experts at scaling fences.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This hound's short coat sheds a moderate amount and is effective at repelling dirt. Brush weekly to remove loose fur. You might notice an increase in shedding seasonally, at which time you'll want to brush a couple times per week to capture the loose fur. </p><p>Only occasional baths are necessary, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Rubbing your dog down with a wet towel can help to keep it clean between baths. Check your dog's nails roughly once a month to see whether they need a trim. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><p>Furthermore, these dogs' long, floppy ears need some extra attention to make sure they stay healthy. Check the ears at least weekly for excess wax, debris, redness, and other abnormalities. And always check them after outdoor time in nature, as ticks can hide in and around the ears. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>These dogs typically excel when it comes to training. They are bright and eager to please, though they also can be stubborn and strong-willed at times. But they respond well to positive training methods. It's important to be consistent with your commands to prevent bad habits from forming.</p><p>Start training and socialization as young as possible. Take your dog to a puppy obedience class when it meets the age requirement, and introduce it to different people, other dogs, and various situations. </p><p>Due to this breed's high prey drive, it doesn't always do well with smaller household pets, including cats, that it might mistake for prey. However, careful training and growing up around these animals can result in them coexisting peacefully.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide your dog with fresh water. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. Most owners feed two measured meals per day.

Overall, the dog is longer than it is tall. It appears to be a big dog on short legs thanks to its large head and deep, muscular chest. Its front legs have a bow to them, yet the dog still has a powerful and agile gait. The Glen was originally used as a pest exterminator and hunting dog, as well as a working farm dog.

They don't have quite the energetic and busy personality that some other terrier breeds do, but they still enjoy an active lifestyle. </p><h2>History of the Glen of Imaal Terrier</h2><p>The exact origin of the Glen of Imaal terrier is unknown. But the breed hails from the mountainous and remote County Wicklow in Ireland. The farmers there needed hard-working dogs that could perform a variety of tasks. They used the terriers to exterminate vermin and to hunt badgers, foxes, and other game. </p><p>One of the breed's odd jobs gave it the nickname ""turnspit dog."" People used their Glens to walk on a hamster wheel-like contraption that turned meat over a cooking fire. The dogs' powerful front legs served them well in this task.</p><p>The Glen of Imaal terrier began to gain recognition beyond its remote environment toward the end of the 1800s, and it slowly started arriving in North America in the early 1900s.

However, don't allow your dog to engage in strenuous exercise until it is fully grown, as this can damage its growth plates.

Puzzle toys also can provide mental challenges. </p><p>Moreover, keep your Glen of Imaal terrier on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. This breed has a strong prey drive and might take off chasing perceive prey if given the chance.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog weekly to remove any loose fur and prevent tangles. Pay special attention to the fur around the ears, chest, stomach, and legs, which can be prone to matting. Also, this breed should have its coat hand-stripped a few times per year to remove the dead fur that doesn't shed out on its own. </p><p>Bathe your dog every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. But check its ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Also, trim its nails roughly every month, and brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socialization when your dog is a puppy to help prevent bad habits from forming. Glens are relatively smart, but they can be stubborn and get bored with repetitive training. So try to keep training sessions short, varied, and fun. Always use positive-reinforcement methods, such as treats and praise. </p><p>Moreover, aim to expose your dog to different people and other dogs from a young age.

Also known as the Kangal shepherd, the breed has a fierce protective instinct and an independent nature. These dogs can be quite introverted, often preferring to do their jobs without human guidance or interference. They can make good family pets, though it is advised that socialization with both humans and other animals starts early. Anatolian shepherds without proper socialization can easily become aggressive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 27 inches (female), 29 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 80 to 120 pounds (female), 110 to 150 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Short, smooth</p><p>COAT COLOR: Blue fawn, brindle, fawn, liver, red fawn, white, biscuit and white, or gray fawn with various markings and masks</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 11 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, alert, protective</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Turkey</p><h2>Characteristics of the Anatolian Shepherd</h2><p>The Anatolian shepherd generally has an independent and watchful temperament. These dogs don't display overly affectionate personalities, but they are loyal to their family. However, they can be wary of strangers.</p><h2>History of the Anatolian Shepherd</h2><p>The Anatolian shepherd is an ancient dog breed stretching back as many as six centuries. The breed's origins are in the Anatolia region of Turkey, also referred to as Asia Minor, where they are thought to have developed from a line of shepherds (the Coban Kopegi, or ""shepherd's dog"") that were bred specifically to protect and herd livestock. Other accounts trace the Anatolian shepherd back to hunting dogs of Mesopotamia. In both cases, it's understood that these types of shepherds were bred to work in particular on farms and ranches guarding livestock from predators including wolves and cheetahs.</p><p>Interestingly, Anatolian shepherds first came to the United States as part of a top-secret World War II project overseen by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The goal of the project was to evaluate various breeds to deduce which was best suited for sheep pasture work. But the project ended without much fanfare, and the Anatolian shepherds involved were sold to buyers in the Virgin Islands.</p><p>Anatolian shepherds made their way back to the U.S. in the 1970s. And in 1996 the American Kennel Club first recognized the breed.</p><h2>Anatolian Shepherd Care</h2><p>Proper training and socialization are essential to ensure you have a well-adjusted Anatolian shepherd. Fortunately, this breed doesn't require an excessive amount of exercise, and its grooming needs are straightforward.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim to give this moderate-energy breed at least an hour of exercise per day via walks, jogging, games of fetch, and more. Puzzle toys can provide both exercise and mental stimulation.</p><p>The breed doesn't do very well living in small spaces, such as an apartment, and requires room to roam. Ideally it should have access to a securely fenced yard to be able to stretch its legs. But note that the fence should be high enough and a solid surface, so this protective breed can't interact with people and dogs it doesn't know. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Anatolian shepherd's thick coat is fairly low maintenance. You'll generally have to brush weekly to remove loose fur. But expect heavier shedding periods twice a year, often in the spring and fall, when you'll have to brush more often to keep up with the loose fur.</p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. And check your dog's nails on a monthly basis as well to see whether they need a trim. Also, aim to brush its teeth daily. And check its ears at least weekly to look for wax buildup and any abnormalities.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Anatolian shepherds are instinctively wary of strangers and can be quite protective. Training and socialization from a young age are imperative to keep this instinct manageable. A dog of this breed that's not well-socialized will commonly become aggressive toward other animals and even people. </p><p>These dogs usually take well to obedience training. However, their independent nature sometimes can make them strong-willed and stubborn. Consistent training from a young age using positive reinforcement is important for success. Moreover, Anatolian shepherds should never receive protection or guard dog training, as this can exacerbate their tendency toward aggression.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>In general, Anatolian shepherds are a healthy breed. In fact, while such health issues as hip dysplasia and bloat commonly affect several other breeds, they are relatively rare in Anatolian shepherds.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Make sure fresh water is always available for your dog. And feed a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's common to feed two measured meals per day. But you should discuss both the type of food and the amount with your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. As a breed, Anatolian shepherds don't tend to overeat. But it's still important to monitor treats and other extra food to prevent excess weight gain.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Anatolian Shepherd</h2><p>While Anatolian shepherds aren't a common breed, it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home.

Overall, it is a compact but muscular, well-balanced, and rugged breed that can withstand rough terrain and climates. It once played an integral role in Scandinavia as a hunting and farm dog.

High energy also helps to shape this dog's personality, and it prefers an active household.</p><h2>History of the Norrbottenspets</h2><p>Spitz-type dogs have existed in various forms in Scandinavia for centuries. The Norrbottenspets' origin is unclear. But its name essentially means spitz from Norrbotten, a Swedish province. Its ancestors likely existed in the region for hundreds if not thousands of years when semi-wild dogs would serve as hunting companions for the people there. </p><p>Hunting for both food and fur was a necessity in this area for a long time. However, the demand for fur dropped after World War II, and the Norrbottenspets breed all but vanished as it was no longer needed for hunting. The remaining purebred dogs were located in Sweden and Finland, and breeding programs ensued to preserve the breed. </p><p>The American Kennel Club admitted the Norrbottenspets into its Foundation Stock Service, which helps to monitor breeding, in 2007. And it is now grouped in the AKC's miscellaneous class. It still is quite uncommon in Scandinavia and very rare elsewhere. </p><h2>Norrbottenspets Care</h2><p>Plan to spend a good amount of time each day exercising your Norrbottenspets. Grooming needs for this dog are fairly straightforward. And it generally takes well to training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least an hour or two of exercise for this bright and energetic dog every day. Brisk walks, jogging, hiking, swimming, and vigorous games of fetch all are ideal activities. Plus, dog sports, such as agility and rally, can help to challenge your dog mentally as well as physically.

The intelligent Norrbottenspets generally does very well with positive-reinforcement training methods; avoid using harsh corrections. Also, try to make training sessions fun and varied to hold your dog's attention. </p><p>This breed can be somewhat reserved around strangers.

Energetic and strong-willed, they excel in a variety of dog sports but continue to remain a coveted breed for their abilities as both a retriever and gun dog. They are known for their coarse, curly coats and active, independent personalities, and they love to spend time with their families.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Gundog (UKC)</p><p>Height: 21-23 inches</p><p>Weight: 33-44 pounds</p><p>Coat: Thick, coarse, curly</p><p>Coat Color: Black and white, liver and white, solid black, or solid liver</p><p>Life Span: 12-13 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, alert, loyal, stubborn, active, gentle, quiet</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Netherlands</p><h2>Characteristics of the Wetterhoun</h2><p>Though touted as a hunting breed, Wetterhouns have tolerant and loyal personalities that make them ideal family pets. They love the water and prefer an active lifestyle, happy to accompany their owners on hikes, runs, and adventures outdoors. They are a fiercely loyal and attached breed, preferring to be by their owner's side at all times.</p><h2>History of the Wetterhoun</h2><p>The Wetterhoun was first developed more than 400 years ago in Friesland, a province of the Netherlands. Their common name comes from the Dutch word for ""water dog,"" though they are sometimes referred to as the Otterhound or Dutch Spaniel (even though they're technically not a type of spaniel). Throughout its history, the Wetterhoun has been relied upon not only as a water retriever but also as a trustworthy and efficient gun dog and watchdog.</p><p>The Wetterhoun is believed to have descended from the now-extinct Old Water Dog, though some believe it may have also been crossed with an indigenous Frisian breed. Thanks to careful and meticulous breeding practices, the breed was successfully saved from near-extinction during World War II.</p><p>The Wetterhoun is not currently recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) however, the breed is recognized by the Federation Cynologique International, where it is included as part of the water dogs group, as well as the United Kennel Club (UKC), where it is part of the gundog group. The Wetterhoun is recognized as a rare breed by many smaller clubs and registries, as well.</p><h2>Wetterhoun Care</h2><p>While Wetterhouns are not difficult to care for, they do require a decent amount of training and activity that can make them the wrong choice for certain households primarily those families or owners with little free time. Wetterhouns have natural guarding abilities and are considered to be somewhat reserved. Because of this, they are generally not considered an aggressive breed, making them a good option for families and those with existing pets.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Like most breeds, the Wetterhoun will require daily exercise for both their physical and mental well-being. As a hunting breed, they are fairly active dogs, so you'll want to aim for about 30 minutes of activity a day, plus plenty of outdoor play. As water dogs, they will be more than happy to take a dip in a pool or lake and are sure to enjoy pretty much any activity involving water.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Wetterhouns have a thick coat of coarse, curly hair that covers their entire body, though it is a bit shorter on the legs and head. It is naturally oily and therefore somewhat waterproof, so they will not require frequent bathing or extensive grooming.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Although they can be stubborn and strong-willed, the Wetterhoun is not a breed that tends to be purposely disobedient. You'll want to start their training as early as possible because of their headstrong personalities, the breed is both intelligent and watchful, so they are fast learners but do still have an independent streak. They can definitely be trained, but steer clear of punishment or other harsh tactics they can be sensitive and will respond much better to positive reinforcement. Because of their strong history as a gun dog, the Wetterhoun is a breed that thrives when given a job to perform.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Wetterhouns are considered a fairly healthy breed, but they have been associated with hip, elbow, and other joint issues, as well as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that can lead to death in certain breeds. As a result, the NVSW (Dutch Association for Stabij- and Wetterhoun) has introduced efforts to introduce more genetic variety into the breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Whether their food is commercially prepared or cooked at home (with your veterinarian's approval), the Wetterhoun should do well on any high-quality diet. Due to the fact that the Wetterhoun is a hunting breed with lots of energy, you may want to opt for a dog food that's formulated for active breeds in order to ensure their nutritional needs are met.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Wetterhoun</h2><p>Generally speaking, if you want to bring home a Wetterhoun you may have quite the search on your hands. As a rare breed whose numbers have dwindled since World War II, it's pretty unlikely that you'll find these dogs in a rescue center or shelter. There are also no known Wetterhoun rescue organizations. You'd be most likely to stumble upon this breed in the Netherlands, where there are still several reputable breeders available.</p><h2>Wetterhoun Overview</h2><p>Good with children and elderly</p><p><br/></p><p>Requires minimal bathing and grooming</p><p><br/></p><p>Excellent watchdogs</p><p>Can be stubborn and strong-willed</p><p><br/></p><p>Needs a good amount of exercise</p><p>Not hypoallergenic</p>",860

Flat-coats are ideal for active owners who like to spend a lot of time outdoors.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 22 to 23.5 inches (female), 23 to 24.5 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 60 to 70 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Black, liver</p><p>Life Span: 8 to 10 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, energetic, playful</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Flat-Coated Retriever</h2><p>Flat-coated retrievers are known for having a friendly and upbeat temperament. They generally get along well with kids and even other dogs. A high energy level and love of playtime also help to shape this breed's personality.</p><h2>History of the Flat-Coated Retriever</h2><p>The flat-coated retriever can trace its origin to the mid-1800s in England. The St. John's water dog, a predecessor to the Labrador retriever that was imported to England from Newfoundland, is a component of the breed, along with various setter dog breeds. Collie breeds also are in the mix, which might have contributed to the breed's high intelligence and trainability. And spaniel breeds added their hunting and swimming abilities. </p><p>Flat-coats were prized for their athleticism, eagerness to please and work, and prowess in retrieving waterfowl. Their coat also was a desirable trait, as it protected them from the elements including icy waters. Other names for the breed have included the smooth-coated retriever, wavy-coated retriever, and black wavy retriever. </p><p>They became England's most popular retriever breed until the Lab and golden eventually dethroned them in the early 1900s. Breed numbers diminished during the World Wars, and flat-coats are still fairly rare today. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1915.</p><h2>Flat-Coated Retriever Care</h2><p>Flat-coated retrievers need lots of daily exercise to be happy and healthy dogs. Fortunately, their grooming needs are fairly straightforward, and they generally take well to training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Expect to spend at least two hours per day exercising this active dog. Long walks, running, cycling, hiking, swimming, and vigorous games of fetch all are ideal. Adequate mental stimulation also is important. Puzzle toys and dog sports, such as agility and rally, can help to burn both physical and mental energy. </p><p>When flat-coats don't get enough exercise and mental stimulation, they might develop problem behaviors, such as excessive barking or chewing. It's best that they live in a home with a yard in which they can run and play freely.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Plan to brush your dog at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent mats. Except periods of higher shedding, often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to increase brushing to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your dog roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. And look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and signs of infection. Always dry the ears well after a bath or swimming. Moreover, check your dog's nails every month or so to see whether they need a trim. And brush its teeth ideally every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Flat-coats are typically highly trainable dogs thanks to their intelligence and connection with their humans. But you should always use positive reinforcement training methods, as they are sensitive to harsh corrections. Start training and socialization from as young of an age as possible to prevent bad habits from forming. Many flat-coats also do well in advanced training, such as learning how to be a service or therapy dog. </p><p>You also might have to work with a professional trainer, behaviorist, or vet on separation anxiety issues. Flat-coats don't like to be left alone for long periods and might engage in unwanted behaviors if they are. Even with training, it's still ideal that they're in a household with someone home for much of the day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure that your dog is receiving the right amount. Ask for your vet's recommendations on how much you should feed your dog and whether you need to make any special individual adjustments, such as a particular diet for your dog's age or activity level.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Flat-Coated Retriever</h2><p>Flat-coated retrievers are a relatively rare breed, but it's still possible to find them at animal shelters. Look for breed-specific rescue organizations in your area as well, and see whether local shelters have a breed wait list you can put your name on. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $1,000 to $2,000, though this can vary widely.</p><h2>Flat-Coated Retriever Overview</h2><p>Generally good with kids and other dogs</p><p>Typically very friendly and playful</p><p>Good for people who enjoy outdoor activities, including hiking and swimming</p><p>Needs lots of exercise and mental stimulation</p><p>Can become destructive if left alone for long periods</p><p>Not ideal for apartment living</p>",845

Besides their hair length, the Cymric and Manx are virtually identical both have rounded features and naturally short tails. These slow-to-mature breeds also share playful, kitten-like personalities that persist into adulthood. The Cymric and Manx are so genetically similar that Manx kittens may appear in Cymric litters and vice versa. <br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Longhair Manx</p><p>Personality: Friendly, playful, kittenish, sociable</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Any color except chocolate or lavender</p><p>Coat Patterns: Any pattern except Himalayan or patterns mixed with white</p><p>Eye Color: Any</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Isle of Man</p><h2>Cymric Characteristics</h2><p>The Cymric is a slow-growing cat, taking up to two years to fully mature. Even when it is an adult, this medium-sized cat continues to act like a playful kitten. Its friendly personality makes it a great pet for most people, including families with kids and other pets.</p><h2>History of the Cymric</h2><p>The Cymric evolved on the Isle of Man, an island located in the middle of the Irish Sea, with the Manx breed. The first felines arrived on the island via ship, but no one knows where they originated.</p><p>Sometime in the late 18th century, a spontaneous natural mutation occurred in a litter of kittens they were born without tails. Within the island's limited gene pool, the mutation passed to more and more cats until the Manx breed and its long-haired variant, the Cymric, became well-established. </p><p>Manx cats were part of the earliest cat shows in the 1800s, but the long-haired variety was not as well-known. Later, the long-haired Manx became known as the Cymric, which means ""relating to Wales,"" the country near the Isle of Man where many long-haired tailless cats were found. </p><p>Various cat registries recognize the Cymric differently. For instance, the Cat Fanciers' Association considers the breed to be a long-haired variety of the Manx breed. The CFA calls the breed Longhair Manx, and it follows the Manx breed standard, which includes both Shorthair Manx and Longhair Manx. The International Cat Association and the Canadian Cat Association both recognize the Cymric as a separate breed from the Manx. Both TICA and the CCA have established a unique breed standard for the Cymric. </p><h2>Cymric Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Cymric's medium-length, dense, double coat sheds moderately. To keep the coat glossy, brush two or three times a week and bathe occasionally if the coat feels greasy or starts to clump.</p><p>Keep your Cymric's nails trimmed short and check the ears occasionally, cleaning with a cotton ball and pet-safe cleaner if you see dirt or debris.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Cymric cats are intelligent and playful. Some are even known to play fetch with toys. Help your Cymric get enough exercise by encouraging play with a variety of fun and stimulating toys and climbing opportunities, including feather wands to chase and cat towers to climb. Cymric cats are people-oriented, so they don't do well when left alone for long.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Cymric cats and Manx share the same health concerns. The gene that causes the Cymric and Manx to be tailless is associated with spinal defects like spina bifida, which can cause neurological issues difficulty moving normally or elimination difficulty. Such problems are typically noticed early (before six months of age). Depending on the severity of the condition, the kitten may need to be humanely euthanized. </p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Cymric is a medium-sized cat with rounded features: a round head with round cheeks and muzzle, round eyes, and a short and round body with an arched back and even a rounded rump (accentuated by taillessness). When picked up, the well-muscled Cymric feels heavy for its size.</p><p>In the ideal specimen, the lack of tail appears to be absolute, although some cats may have a slight rise of bone at the end of the spine. Some kittens are born with stubby tails and even full-length tails, although this is a disqualification in the show ring.</p><p>The Cymric's medium-length, dense, double coat is longer on the shoulders, chest, neck, belly, and back of the legs. The full, plush coat feels soft and silky to the touch.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>With cat obesity at an all-time high. and the Cymric's already round build, it's important not to overfeed your cat. Staying lean will help prevent weight-related health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Feed measured amounts of cat food at regular meal times two to three times a day.</p><p>Leaving food out all day (free feeding) might be easy, but it can lead to continuous snacking, which can contribute to an overweight cat. Ask your veterinarian or breeder about the best food to feed your Cymric.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cymric</h2><p>If you're thinking about buying a Cymric kitten, a great place to meet local breeders is a cat show. Cat shows are a fun place to see many different cat breeds all under one roof. To find a cat show in your area, do an internet search for ""cat show near me"" or visit http://www.catshows.us.  </p><p>Make sure to investigate breeders and request a guarantee of spinal health. Irresponsible breeders are more like to use unhealthy cats in their operations, increasing the likelihood of spinal problems.</p><p>Some Cymric or Cymric-mix cats, usually adults, might end up in rescues. Check with local cat-specific rescue groups or even local shelters.</p><h2>Cymric Overview</h2><p>The cute, rounded Cymric is a slow-growing Welsh cat with an endearing kittenish personality. This long-haired Manx variety is tailless due to a natural genetic mutation that occurred early in its history, but the trait is linked to spinal problems that are most prevalent in irresponsibly bred cats.</p><p>Cymrics enjoy company and adapt well to households with kids and other pets.

The English Lab is technically the same breed as the American Lab; the American version is just slightly lankier. But otherwise the two are very much alike. The dog features a sturdy, muscular build with a broad head, friendly eyes, and triangular ears. The Lab's tail is medium-length and tapers toward its tip. While this breed is a strong athlete (and particularly excellent swimmer), it's also a lovable companion that can excel in service and therapy work.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 55 to 70 pounds (female), 65 to 80 pounds (male)</p><p>Weight: 21.5 to 23.5 inches (female), 22.5 to 24.5 inches (male)</p><p>Coat: Short double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Yellow, chocolate, black</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Active, friendly, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom</p><h2>Characteristics of the English Labrador</h2><p>English Labradors generally have a friendly and upbeat temperament. Most tend to get along well with everyone, including other dogs and strangers, when they've had proper training and socialization. High energy and an eagerness to please also help to shape the Lab's personality.</p><h2>History of the English Labrador</h2><p>The ancestors of the English Labrador actually came from Newfoundland, Canada (not Labrador). Back in the early 1800s, there was a breed in this area known as the St. John's water dog also called the lesser Newfoundland which worked on fishing boats. English nobles visiting the area took note of these dogs and ended up taking some back home with them. </p><p>The breed continued to be refined in the United Kingdom. It was used as a gun dog to retrieve waterfowl during hunts, thanks to its loyal and responsive nature and prowess in the water. </p><p>The version of the dog back in Newfoundland ended up dying out, so the Lab's breed standard we know today came from the U.K. The Kennel Club of the United Kingdom first recognized the Lab in 1903, while the American Kennel Club admitted it in 1917.<br/></p><h2>English Labrador Care</h2><p>Plan to give your Labrador ample daily exercise. And be prepared to spend some time on brushing to keep up with the loose fur. Fortunately, Labs typically take well to training and socialization.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least a couple hours of exercise per day for your Lab. In general, Labs would rather exercise and play with you rather than being left to their own devices. Long walks, running, cycling, swimming, and hikes all are ideal activities. Plus, this retrieving breed loves vigorous games of fetch. Dog sports, such as dock diving, also are excellent ways to provide mental and physical challenges for this water-loving athlete. Training your Lab in service or therapy work can help to keep it mentally stimulated as well. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Plan to brush your Lab a couple times per week to remove the loose fur and distribute skin oils. Also, expect periods of higher shedding typically as the weather changes in the spring and fall. During these times, you might have to brush daily to keep up with all the loose fur. </p><p>A Lab's coat stays pretty clean with regular brushing. But you should still plan on a bath roughly once a month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Also, check your dog's ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning, and be sure to dry them well after swimming and baths. In addition, trim your dog's nails every month on average, and brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socialization ideally when your Lab is a puppy to prevent bad habits from forming. A puppy class is a great way to teach basic commands and manners. Labs are smart and eager to please, so they typically pick up on training quickly. Plus, they tend to be very food-motivated and respond well to positive-reinforcement training methods. </p><p>To socialize your Lab, aim to expose it to different people, other dogs, and various locations from an early age. As long as Labs have positive experiences around strangers, they tend to be very friendly when meeting someone new.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide fresh water for your Lab. Feed it a high-quality canine diet with balanced nutrition, typically via two measured meals per day. Some Labs are prone to overeating and becoming overweight, so be sure to measure your dog's daily diet and be mindful about treats. Discuss both the type of food and the proper amount with your vet. </p><p>Also, because Labs are prone to bloat, which can be triggered by eating too quickly, you might want to feed smaller, more frequent meals. Try to keep your dog calm around mealtimes, as well.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an English Labrador</h2><p>English Labradors are more common in the United Kingdom, but it's still possible to find Labs of this variety elsewhere.

In fact, the breed's name comes from the German word for ""ape"" or ""monkey."" These dogs usually are black but can come in other colors as well. They have a short nose with shaggier fur around their head that forms a mane. They tend to be very playful and feisty, making for amusing companions.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Toy</p><p>HEIGHT: 9 to 11.5 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 7 to 10 pounds</p><p>COAT: Wiry, short- to medium-length</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, black and silver, black and tan, belge (black and reddish-brown), red with a black mask</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Lively, fearless, friendly</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Affenpinscher</h2><p>The affenpinscher is full of personality and loves to engage in amusing antics. This dog can have a strong-willed temperament and doesn't always want to comply with training, but it still tends to be loving with its family.</p><h2>History of the Affenpinscher</h2><p>Affenpinschers can trace their roots back to Germany in the 1600s. Back then, they were somewhat larger in size and were bred for their expert skill as a ratter. They helped to exterminate rodents in stables and in households. And they were beloved family pets as well.</p><p>It's speculated that German pinschers and pugs contributed to the breed. Affenpinschers helped to spur the development of multiple breeds, including the Brussels Griffon and miniature schnauzer. </p><p>Breed clubs for affenpinschers didn't arise until the late 1800s. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1936. And it is still a rare dog breed in the United States today.</p><h2>Affenpinscher Care</h2><p>Affenpinschers aren't high-energy dogs, but they still require a moderate amount of exercise each day. They also need consistent training and socialization to be well-mannered dogs. And they require more than just basic grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim to provide at least 30 minutes to an hour of daily exercise for an affenpinscher. A couple of brisk walks and playtime should be sufficient. Dog sports and puzzle toys also can serve to provide physical activity and mental stimulation. </p><p>Be aware that this breed can overheat easily due to its short nose, so keep outdoor time brief in hot weather. In addition, don't underestimate this little dog's ability to run off quickly (and stubbornly ignore your calls) if it sees a rodent it wants to chase outside. Always keep it on leash or in a securely fenced area.<br/><br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Affenpinschers don't shed much, but they do need a fair amount of grooming. Use a slicker brush and then a comb at least twice a week to remove loose fur and prevent the coat from matting. </p><p>You'll also have to trim your dog's coat every couple of months or so. Many owners opt for a professional groomer to do the trimming, but you can learn to do it at home as well. Be sure to trim around the eyes to ensure that your dog has a clear sightline. </p><p>Baths will be necessary every couple of months or so, as the coat stays fairly clean. Check your dog's ears at least weekly for any wax buildup, debris, and irritation. And check its nails monthly to see whether they need a trim. Also, aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Affenpinschers can have an independent mindset, which in turn makes them a bit stubborn when it comes to training. But they still are bright and eager to learn, especially when you use positive training methods and make training sessions feel like a game to them. Moreover, short training sessions are best to keep their focus. </p><p>Aim to start training as young as possible to prevent bad habits from forming. Enroll in a puppy obedience class where your dog can learn basic skills and manners. Also, start socialization from a young age, exposing your dog to different people and situations. </p><p>Affenpinschers often don't like rough handling, such as being squeezed, which might not make them an ideal match for young children. They're moderately tolerant of other dogs, especially when socialized together from a young age. But they might not be suitable around smaller household pets, especially rodents, due to their prey drive.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure fresh water is accessible to your dog. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. Most owners feed two measured meals per day. But you should discuss quantity, as well as type of food, with your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Monitor treats and other extra food, so your dog doesn't become overweight. Even gaining an extra pound can be significant for a little dog like an affenpinscher. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Affenpinscher</h2><p>The affenpinscher isn't a common breed, but it's still worth checking local shelters for a dog in need of a home. Also, see whether there is a breed-specific rescue group in your area.

The breed's ancestors came to the U.S. from Europe by way of Australia, hence its name. This shepherd-type dog is extremely intelligent, loyal, and hard-working. It makes an excellent companion dog for high-energy owners. It also is adept at herding, as well as dog sports, search-and-rescue, and work as a service dog.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 18 to 21 inches (female), 20 to 23 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 40 to 55 pounds (female), 50 to 65 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Medium double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Blue merle, red merle, black, or red; all colors may have white markings and/or tan (copper) points</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, active, energetic</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Intelligent and Loyal Aussie</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Australian Shepherd</h2><p>Australian shepherds tend to have an exuberant temperament. They possess a high energy level and intelligence to match, so they need lots of mental stimulation and physical activity. The good news is most Aussies have very trainable personalities and are eager to please.</p><h2>History of the Australian Shepherd</h2><p>The Australian shepherd breed was developed in the United States. But it descends from European herding dogs that lived around the Pyrenees Mountains. In the 1800s, some of the indigenous Basque people took their dogs from this region and traveled to Australia, hoping to find more cattle land. </p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the Australian shepherd breed in 1991. The AKC later recognized the miniature American shepherd, a smaller version of the Aussie, in 2015.</p><h2>Australian Shepherd Care</h2><p>The Aussie can make a wonderful companion for the right family. It tends to adapt well to different kinds of active households, as long as they can provide proper exercise and training. Aussies also need regular grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>It is absolutely essential for your Aussie to get frequent exercise, even more than most dogs. This intelligent and high-energy dog breed can become bored, frustrated, and hyperactive if it doesn't get enough mental and physical stimulation. Aussies should get at least one to two hours per day of fairly strenuous activity, such as running, playing fetch, or training in dog sports, such as agility. Puzzle toys also can help to keep them mentally stimulated.</p><p>Be sure to walk an Australian shepherd on a leash, as the breed has a natural instinct to chase (i.e., herd) moving objects, including passersby, bicycles, other animals, and even cars. Aussies also will need a secure solid fence when they are out in the yard rather than an electronic fence, which won't always dissuade their urge to chase and herd.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Aussie has a thick medium-length double coat that sheds year-round. So routine grooming is important to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Brush at least one to two times per week. Moreover, Aussies will typically shed their thicker winter coat in the spring. You'll likely have to brush more frequently during this time to keep up with all the loose fur. But the coat is quite weather-resistant and generally only needs an occasional bath. Furthermore, it's important to keep the ears clean, brush your dog's teeth regularly, and trim its nails regularly for healthy and comfortable feet.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Due to their high intelligence, Aussies are generally receptive to training and learn quickly. And with proper and consistent training, Aussies tend to be extremely obedient. You can start training when the dogs are puppies with socialization to different people and environments, as well as basic commands like sit and stay. Proper socialization is important, as Aussies tend to be reserved around new people and can become shy or defensive.</p><p>Remember this breed's focus is work. Most Aussies are happier with a ""job,"" and training in different activities can be that job. Getting your Aussie involved in dog sports, as well as assistance/service, search-and-rescue, or pet therapy, can be a way to channel its energy and strengthen your bond, so it becomes a more obedient dog.<br/></p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>An Australian shepherd typically should be fed two meals per day of a nutritionally balanced dog food. The amount will depend on your dog's size, activity level, age, and other factors. Discuss your dog's nutritional needs with your veterinarian to get appropriate recommendations, and consistently monitor your dog's weight. Also, make sure fresh water is always available to your Aussie, especially in hot weather and during periods of intense exercise.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Australian Shepherd</h2><p>Check your local animal shelter and breed-specific rescue groups for Australian shepherds. It's fairly common for people to realize they can't handle the Aussie's high energy level and intelligence, so they give up their dog for adoption. Thus, as you're considering this breed, make sure you're realistic about the time and energy you have to devote to it. Aussie puppies can cost around $1,000 to $2,000 from breeders on average, though this can vary widely. Adult dogs and rescue groups often have lower costs.</p><h2>Australian Shepherd Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and loyal</p><p>Trainable and eager to please</p><p>Excels at ""jobs"" and athletic endeavors</p><p>Boundless energy that must be channeled through training</p><p>Can become destructive without enough mental and physical stimulation</p><p>Can be wary of strangers</p>",858

Even with all of their energy, ocicats have a stable temperament that makes them easygoing companions in bustling households.</p><h2>History of the Ocicat</h2><p>The first ocicat, named Tonga, was born in 1964 as a result of experimental breeding by US cat fancier Virginia Daly.</p><p>In an effort to create an ""Abypoint Siamese"" (a Siamese with Abyssinian colorpoints), she bred a ruddy Abyssinian male to a seal point Siamese female, An Abyssianin-colored female from the resulting litter was bred to a chocolate point Siamese, and their offspring resulted in Siamese kittens with Abyssinian points.</p><p>After a repeat breeding, Tonga was born an ivory kitten with golden spots. Daly's daughter said that Tonga looked like an ocelot and should be called an ""ocicat."" Daly, uninterested in creating a new breed, dismissed the idea, neutered Tonga. and gave her to a new home.</p><p>Geneticist Dr. Clyde Keeler took an interest in an ocelot-looking domestic cat. He wanted to see a domestic cat that could resemble some of the vanishing wild cats, specifically the Egyptian spotted fishing cat. So, Daly repeated the breeding that produced Tonga and came up with a tawny spotted male for use in Dr. Keeler's project. The next step was to introduce the American shorthair to the mix for the desired physical stature and silver coloration. Daly's work was replicated by others, and new lines of ocicats were developed.</p><p>The ocicat was recognized for registration by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1966. The breed also received championship status in August of 1986 from the International Cat Association. Today, the ocicat is acknowledged by the American Cat Fancier's Association and Cat Fanciers' Federation.</p><h2>Ocicat Care</h2><p>The ocicat's short, dense coat requires little grooming; brushing with a rubber curry comb and polishing with a chamois cloth will bring out the sheen. Nails should be trimmed regularly (it is best to train a kitten early on to accept trimming), and a scratching post or cardboard scratcher will also help keep the nails healthy while saving your furniture.</p><p>Indoor life is recommended for all cats, including ocicats. Since there are fewer opportunities for exercise indoors, providing a tall cat tree can encourage safe climbing and access to outside views that all cats love. Toys can also help channel an ociocat's ""wild"" energy into playing.</p><p>The intelligent, high-energy ocicat might also enjoy exploring the outdoors safely, which it can do when trained to walk on a harness or walking jacket and leash. Ocicats are one of the few breeds that are eager to learn tricks and skills, and clicker training is a great way to teach them.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders screen their cats thoroughly for any health problems, particularly those associated with specific breeds.</p><p>Be sure to schedule regular checkups with your veterinarian to catch health issues before they become severe.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Ocicats are not huge cats (up to 15 pounds), but they have solid, muscular bodies that benefit from exercise and athletic challenges. Their short coats are dense and shiny with a variety of possible colors, including blue, silver, lavender, cinnamon, fawn, and chocolate with tabby and spotted patterns.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>An ocicat's strong, athletic body needs a species-appropriate diet to sustain its health and active lifestyle. Grain-free foods are often preferred as are raw diets, but consult your veterinarian about the potential problems associated with certain plant-based diets that may also lack sufficient taurine (an amino acid essential to healthy vision in cats).</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Ocicat</h2><p>When choosing an ocicat, or any other purebred cat, be sure to do your research. Get to know the breeder; it's often recommended that you visit the breeder's home before reserving a kitten (breeders often have waiting lists).</p><p>You may be able to find local breeder connections through Facebook. Breeders have created their own Facebook pages and take part in groups dedicated to sharing their experiences. Don't let distance be a concern; there is an active network of people who transport cats around the country and even the world.</p><h2>Ocicat Overview</h2><p>Ocicats are said to have a dog-like personality and are quick to socialize with family members and visitors. Even after they mature, around one year of age, they remain playful and active. They are happy in a busy household and prefer not to be left alone for a long time.</p><p>Completely domesticated cat with wild, exotic look</p><p>Playful, energetic, and dog-like personality</p><p>Social, gets along well with other cats and dogs</p><p>Prone to conditions affecting the liver, kidney, heart, and gums</p><p>Does not like to be left alone for long periods of time</p><p>May prefer a specialized diet of grain-free or raw proteins</p>",935

The tousled appearance of the Selkirk Rex, coupled with its laid-back attitude, brings new meaning to the saying, ""Curly hair, don't care."" This cat's easygoing personality makes it as charming as it is beautiful.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Laid-back, friendly, affectionate, medium-energy</p><p>Weight: Up to 16 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 30 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short or long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Any genetically possible color or combination</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby, shaded, tortoiseshell, chinchilla, smoke, calico, bicolor, tricolor, pointed, mink, sepia</p><p>Eye Color: Any color</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Selkirk Cat Characteristics</h2><p>While the Selkirk Rex has a very mellow temperament, it is also warm and affectionate; it tends to get along with everyone. This medium to large-sized feline is exceptionally tolerant and friendly, making it a great pet for families with kids or other pets.</p><h2>History of the Selkirk Rex</h2><p>In the late 1980s, a Persian breeder in Montana named Jeri Newman discovered an unusual mixed-breed kitten born to a feral cat. This kitten was the only one in its litter that had a wavy coat and curly whiskers. Newman pounced on this genetic anomaly and adopted the kitten, naming her DePesto. She later bred DePesto to a black Persian male named PhotoFinish of Deekay. Three of the resulting six kittens had wavy coats, and Newman used them to launch the Selkirk Rex breed.</p><p>To build genetic diversity in this new breed, the Cat Fanciers' Association breed standard will allow outcrosses with British shorthairs or exotic shorthairs until January 1, 2025. Thereafter, only kittens from two Selkirk Rex parents will qualify as part of the breed.</p><h2>Selkirk Rex Care</h2><p>The Selkirk Cat's coat doesn't shed much, but it requires unique care because any loose hairs tend to stay trapped in the coat rather than drop off onto your clothes and furniture. When loose hairs stay in the coat, they may cause the coat to become matted. </p><p>Over-brushing the coat is discouraged as it tends to loosen up the curls. Instead, combing with a wide-toothed comb will help prevent mats while maintaining the coat's curls.</p><p>In addition to combing, regular baths can also help avoid matting. The Selkirk Rex's coat looks best when washed with light shampoos that don't weigh the coat down. Ask your breeder or a professional groomer for a shampoo recommendation.</p><p>Avoid using conditioners or conditioning sprays, which may loosen the curls. After a bath, towel dry to remove most of the water, then allow the coat to air dry. Hair dryers can result in frizz or a flat coat rather than crisp curls.</p><p>Trim the nails short and inspect the ears weekly. If the ears look dirty, wipe them out with a cotton ball or square of gauze and a pet-safe ear cleaner. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Like many purebred cats, the Selkirk Rex is prone to certain hereditary genetic conditions.</p><p>Polycystic kidney disease is a condition in which cysts on the kidneys that are present at birth cause problems with kidney function and eventually, kidney failure. PKD is common in Persian cats and exotic shorthairs. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a disease that causes thickening of the heart muscle, is common in Persian cats and British shorthairs. Hip dysplasia is common in Persians.</p><p>All of these breeds are part of the Selkirk Rex's background. A genetic test is available for PKD, and screenings may be performed to determine if a cat is likely to be free from HCM and hip dysplasia.</p><p>Reputable Selkirk Rex breeders screen their adult cats before breeding them to avoid passing on these conditions and to preserve the health of the breed as a whole.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Selkirk Rex may have short hair or long hair. Both coat lengths display curls, but curling is more dramatic in long-haired Selkirk Rexes. Even the Selkirk's whiskers are curly. The coat is soft and plush, with a luxurious feel.</p><p>In a litter of Selkirk Rex kittens, some will have curly hair and some will have straight hair. Straight-haired Selkirk Rex kittens make wonderful pets, although you won't see them competing in the show ring.</p><p>This breed is solidly built, with substantial muscle and boning. <br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Due to the Selkirk Rex's larger frame, it's especially important not to overfeed. Staying lean helps to prevent health issues like diabetes and arthritis, as well as heart disease and hip dysplasia, which are known to affect the breed.</p><p>Ask your veterinarian or breeder about the best food and amounts to feed your Selkirk Rex, and feed measured meals two or three times a day to ensure proper portions. Free feeding (leaving food out all day) can lead to overeating, which can contribute to weight gain.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Selkirk Rex Cat</h2><p>If you're longing to bring home a Selkirk Rex kitten, consider attending a cat show, where you can meet local cat breeders. Cat shows are lots of fun and a wonderful way to learn about all the different cat breeds.</p><p>To find a cat show in your area, do an internet search for ""cat show near me"" or visit CatShows.us. Although rare, some Selkirk Rex or Selkirk mix cats, usually adults, might occasionally end up in rescue. Check with local cat-specific rescue groups or even local shelters.</p><h2>Selkirk Rex Overview</h2><p>The Selkirk Rex initially catches the eye because of its uniquely curly hair, but breed enthusiasts know that this cat's charm is as attractive as its coat. The Selkirk is relaxed and friendly, and it doesn't need a lot of special attention (besides the occasional grooming session). It is not a high-energy cat but enjoys the company of kids, other cats, and dogs. Overall, the Selkirk Rex makes a great companion for just about everyone.</p><p>Uniquely curly coat</p><p>Mellow, friendly personality</p><p>Gets along well with kids and other pets</p><p>Requires regular grooming</p><p>Predisposed to certain health issues</p><p>Rare; may be hard to find</p>",971

They love the great outdoors and are the ideal dog for owners who like to explore nature and stay active. However, their need for physical exercise and their tendency to be reserved with strangers means they aren't for everyone. Learn more about this sweet and under-the-radar dog breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Hound (United Kennel Club); Foundation Stock Service (American Kennel Club)</p><p>HEIGHT: 16 - 26 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 30-60 pounds</p><p>COAT: Short</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, Blue, Brindle, Brown, Red, Yellow; Either a solid color or with white markings, tan markings, or brindle points</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, courageous, active, companionable, lively, loyal</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Europe<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Mountain Cur</h2><p>Mountain Curs have energetic and adventurous personalities, making them a great dog choice for owners who are always on the go exploring. Originally bred for hunting, they love having a ""job"" or task to do and thrive when properly trained. They're affectionate, low-key, and surprisingly not as common as their sweet personalities would suggest.</p><h2>History of the Mountain Cur</h2><p>In the early days of settlement of North America by the Europeans, Mountain Curs were a vital part of a frontier family, especially those settling in the more mountainous regions of the countryside. They were utilized in the hunting of small game such as rabbits and squirrels, but have also proven helpful in hunting larger game such as wild boar (as well as being an all-purpose farm dog).</p><p>For these early settlers, the true heritage of the Mountain Cur wasn't as important as the breed's ability to hunt. Therefore little is known about the breed's true origins. In 1957, the Original Mountain Cur Breeders of America was formed and, in doing so, the Mountain Cur was formally recognized as a breed. The United Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1998 and, although the Mountain Cur is a member of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Group, Mountain Curs are eligible for AKC registration.</p><h2>Mountain Cur Care</h2><p>Mountain Curs are protective of their owners and constantly want to please. Due to their protective nature and their fierce loyalty, the Mountain Cur can be reserved with strangers. However, once they warm up to a stranger they are just as friendly with them as they are with their family. Mountain Curs, being avid hunters, have a high prey drive and as such, they may not be suitable for families with other small pets or small children.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Mountain Curs require vigorous daily exercise in order to maintain their physical and mental wellbeing. Aim to give your pet at least an hour (or more) of active play a day, including running, hiking, swimming, or fetch. Additionally, outdoor sports and hunting can provide well-rounded stimulation, provided your dog is properly trained in those types of environments.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Mountain Curs have a short coat of fur. They shed a low amount throughout the year but most heavily in the spring and fall. They should be bathed and brushed occasionally, especially if time outdoors leaves them particularly muddy.</p><p>A Mountain Cur will need their nails trimmed regularly, about once a month or so. A fractured nail can be painful for your dog and a bloody mess for your home. Keeping your Mountain Cur's nails short will prevent them from breaking their nails on anything in your home or outside.</p><p>Additionally, good oral hygiene can help prevent dental disease. Even if you can't brush your dog's teeth once a day, brushing every other day or a few times a week can go a long way in keeping your Mountain Cur's teeth clean and healthy. Giving your Mountain Cur something for power chewers can help deter them from chewing up your furniture but be aware that it is possible for your dog to break a tooth on hard rubber or plastic chew toys, antlers, or hooves. Only give these to your dog when you are able to supervise them.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Mountain Curs are highly intelligent and as such require daily mental stimulation. This can be by way of a job or task, such as accompanying hunters while they are out searching for small game, chores around the home or farm, or even puzzle toys and feeders. Despite being smart, they can also be stubborn, so their trainability may vary from one dog to another. They are able to be well trained and well socialized, though.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Mountain Cur is generally a healthy dog breed. That being said, there are some issues that seem to occur more frequently with them.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Mountain Curs are very active dogs and as such have a higher caloric requirement than other dog breeds. If feeding a commercial dog food, ensure that it's suitable for your dog's life stage. Currently AAFCO, the governing board that oversees all commercial pet food, only recognizes 'Growth', 'Adult Maintenance', 'Gestation/Lactation', and 'All Life Stages'.</p><p>Generally, an adult Mountain Cur will need to eat about 2 cups of food a day. For easier digestion, this should be divided into at least two meals a day. If you have concerns about the possibility of overfeeding your dog, your vet can help you calculate exactly how many calories a day your dog needs.</p><h2>Where to Adopt of Buy a Mountain Cur</h2><p>Check with your local animal shelter, rescue groups, and your veterinarian for Mountain Curs in need of a good, active home. You can also visit the website for the Original Mountain Cur Breeders Association to find reputable breeders near you. If you're planning on purchasing a Mountain Cur, you can expect to pay between $500 and $1000.</p><h2>Mountain Cur Overview</h2><p>Loyal and dependable</p><p>A hardworking watchdog</p><p>A loving family companion</p><p>Requires daily exercise and activity</p><p>Reserved with strangers</p><p>May not be good around small pets or children</p>",954

As its name suggests, the Czechoslovakian wolfdog resembles a wolf in its body shape, movement, coat texture, coat color, and facial markings. When well-trained, these dogs are loyal and energetic family pets.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: At least 23.5 inches if female and 25.5 inches tall, measured at the shoulder</p><p>WEIGHT: At least 44 pounds if female and 57 pounds if male</p><p>COAT: Straight and close double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Yellowish-gray to silver-gray with a light mask on the face</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 10 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Fearless, lively, quick, sociable, active, courageous</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Czechoslovakia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog</h2><p>The breed forms tight bonds with its immediate family, but the Czechoslovakian wolfdog is inherently suspicious of strangers. Without proper socialization, this innate wariness can go into overdrive. Although the breed can bark, many of the dogs are very quiet.</p><h2>History of the Czechoslovakian Wolfdog</h2><p>The Czechoslovakian wolfdog breed was the byproduct of an experiment. From 1955 to 1965, in what was then the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, a man named Karel Hartl sought to breed wolves and German shepherd dogs for the border guard. Using German shepherds and Carpathian wolves, Hartl meticulously planned breedings.</p><p>After each first wolf and dog breeding, subsequent breedings of the resulting puppies were between hybrids and dogs only no more wolf blood was introduced. The resulting progeny were studied to examine the hybrid dogs' physical and temperament traits, including tenacity, capacity for training, stamina, and more. Dogs that were three and four generations removed from the initial wolf and dog breedings (called F3 and F4, respectively) were used as army service dogs. </p><p>Once the experiment ended, other breeders got their hands on the hybrid dogs and further refined them to solidify desirable traits, using a few more wolves along the way. In 1982, the Czechoslovakian wolfdog received official recognition from the Club of Breeders, with 43 puppies entered in the main Pedigree Register in Prague that year. Since 1983, no wolves have been used in Czechoslovakian wolfdog breedings. </p><p>In 2001, the Czechoslovakian vlcak was recorded in the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service. The breed will be assigned to the Working Group when it achieves full recognition. In 2006, the breed was fully recognized by the United Kennel Club (UKC). </p><h2>Czechoslovakian Wolfdog Care</h2><p>The Czechoslovakian wolfdog is beautiful, loyal, and hardworking, but it's also independent, dominant, and has high energy. In the right hands, the Czechoslovakian wolfdog will shine. Due to its nature as a primitive breed and its high needs, this wolfdog is best cared for by a very experienced owner. The dog only requires somewhat basic grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Czechoslovakian wolfdogs require copious amounts of daily exercise and ample mental stimulation. You will need to give your dog at least two hours of exercise a day, including walks and playtime, to help it thrive. If you are an avid hiker or runner, this breed can make an excellent companion. They are great working dogs and can also excel in competitive dog sports.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Czechoslovakian wolfdog's coat is easy to care for. It's naturally weather-resistant, has very little doggie odor, and dirt brushes right out. Although this breed sheds heavily year-round, it will experience dramatic shedding twice a year (known as ""dropping coat"" or ""blowing coat"").</p><p>The double coat looks dramatically different according to the season. In winter, the undercoat becomes extremely thick and immense, and, in summer, the undercoat is sparse. Regardless of the season, frequent brushing can help manage shedding hair.</p><p>Other than brushing, occasional baths and weekly nail trimming keep the Czechoslovakian wolfdog looking beautiful. Do a weekly peek inside the ears to clean them out. Use a pet-safe ear cleaner when necessary. It is also good to pay attention to dental hygiene and brush your dog's teeth two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Czechoslovakian wolfdogs are extremely intelligent and capable of learning almost anything, but unlike many breeds, they are not push-button dogs that will simply do what you want them to.</p><p>Training methods must be tailored to the breed's primitive and independent nature. Positive, reward-based methods can be successful, but avoid too much repetition, which will become boring to the Czechoslovakian wolfdog.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>In general, this is a healthy and robust breed.</p><p>The dogs should also receive eye certification exams via the OFA Companion Animal Eye Registry (CAER, previously called ""CERF"" exams). </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Highly active and athletic, many Czechoslovakian wolfdogs expend a lot of energy. Working dogs and canine athletes require high-quality, calorie-dense performance diets. If you're not sure what or how much to feed, ask your breeder or veterinarian for a recommendation.</p><p>That said, Czechoslovakian wolfdogs are meant to be lean, so be sure not to overfeed, especially for less-active dogs.</p><p>Feeding measured meals twice a day rather than free feeding (leaving food out all day) will help to avoid too much weight gain. Excess weight can contribute to health problems like hip dysplasia and diabetes. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy Czechoslovakian Wolfdogs</h2><h2>Czechoslovakian Wolfdog Overview</h2><p>Intelligent and loyal</p><p>Hardworking and athletic </p><p>Beautiful wolf-like appearance</p><p>Requires an expert-level owner</p><p>Needs extensive socialization </p><p>Requires lots of exercise</p>",843

Bred as a stylish bird-hunting dog the Brittany is an agile gundog enjoyed on both sides of the Atlantic. Bird dog lovers and families alike appreciate the ""softness"" of the Brittany's face and its high-set ears, as well as its high energy level and eagerness to please.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Brittany Dog</h2><p>A versatile sporting dog, the Brittany also makes an intelligent, affectionate, and playful pet for a family, while also eager and tireless out in the field. A Brittany craves companionship, so it's susceptible to separation anxiety when left alone for more than a few hours.</p><h2>History of the Brittany Dog</h2><p>Although Brittanys resemble spaniels, the dog actually has more of the working characteristics of a pointer or setter. Therefore, the American Kennel Club dropped the word ""spaniel"" from this pointing breed's name in 1982. Brittany dogs earned their name because they were developed in the Brittany province of France between the 17th and 19th centuries. They were officially recognized as a breed in 1907.</p><p>A pointing breed that was designed to become a versatile gundog, the Brittany was adept at both pointing and retrieving, which made these dogs well-suited to working in an array of country environments. Though few records were kept on this breed, it's believed that the dogs that contributed to the Brittany's development were the English setter, Welsh springer spaniel, and possibly some other French spaniel breeds.</p><p>The Brittany's skills as a bird dog soon made the breed in demand by hunters in other countries. The Brittany dog came to the United States in 1931 and, since then, they have also become popular family dogs because of their accommodating size and affectionate, friendly personality.</p><h2>Brittany Dog Care</h2><p>A happy and alert dog, the Brittany is a rugged, high-energy breed that will require daily exercise. If the Brittany dog does not receive ample exercise, it is likely to develop behavioral issues, such as barking, hyperactivity, and destructive chewing. Some Brittany dogs become anxious, which they will also express by chewing and barking. Like most breeds, the Brittany needs proper training and socialization. When well-socialized, most of these dogs will become gentle and peaceful with both people and other animals.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Brittany is a breed that requires a great deal of exercise, but one that will enjoy every active moment with its family. Exercise can include frequent outdoor adventures or extra long walks every day that add up to an hour or more. This athletic and nicely sized dog is ideal for people with active lifestyles, whether going for hikes or playing vigorous games of fetch.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Besides basic grooming needs, the Brittany dog's wash-and-wear coat will need just a weekly brushing to control shedding and other basic grooming. Some Brittany owners choose to take their pet to a groomer to have the hair trimmed from around the neck, ears, and sometimes the pasterns to give the dog a sleeker silhouette. If your Brittany has a lot of white on its coat, opt for a dog coat whitening shampoo.</p><p>It is also good to pay attention to dental hygiene and brush your dog's teeth two to three times per week.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>A sensitive dog with a softer temperament, the Brittany responds best to gentle, calm training. These dogs are not likely to do well in tense, stressful home environments or situations. Fortunately, the breed is smart and eager to please, so the dogs aren't particularly difficult to train.</p><p>Some Brittany dogs may be timid, submissive, and have a tendency to whine, so early socialization will help them develop a confident, easygoing temperament. Adolescents can be particularly prone to submissive urination, so they may have an accident when becoming over-excited or intimidated, such as when an adult is standing over them or reaching over to pet them. This issue can also be corrected with time and training.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Brittany is generally a healthy breed. Due to their high levels of activity while playing or working outdoors, Brittany dogs may need to be treated for physical injuries, such as lacerations, broken bones, or ligament tears.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Brittany will perform well with any high-quality dog food but will thrive on a higher-protein diet. As an especially active breed, they may require more water than the average dog. A puppy will do well with three to four meals a day, but stick to two meals a day for an adult Brittany.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Brittany</h2><p>Brittany dogs are somewhat low-cost, even if you work with a breeder. Expect to pay about $500 to $1,000 for a Brittany pup depending on its lineage. However, a Brittany may be available at local pet shelters or dog foster groups within your area.</p><h2>Brittany Overview</h2><p>Aims to please its human</p><p>High-energy pal for active people</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming and hair care</p><p>Suffers separation anxiety</p><p>Prone to genetic health issues, specifically hip dysplasia.</p><p>Needs a lot of attention from owners</p>",822

This breed has no wild blood. A mix of the American shorthair and the Burmese breeds, the Bombay is friendly and sociable, making it a dream-come-true for feline fanciers who love the idea of cuddling a wild cat.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, sociable, needy, playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 20 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Black</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid</p><p>Eye Color: Gold or copper</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: USA</p><h2>Characteristics of the Bombay Cat</h2><p>Cats are known for being independent, but it seems Bombay cats ""missed the memo."" Bombays crave human company. If you work long hours away from home or travel a lot, then a Bombay might not be the best breed choice. They simply need too much interaction and will get depressed if left alone.</p><p>Because they are outgoing and sociable, Bombays will greet strangers with curious interest and are happy to play with kids as long as they are gentle.  Bombays even get along with friendly dogs and other cats, especially when raised together. </p><h2>History of the Bombay Cat</h2><p>The Bombay was developed by a US cat breeder named Nikki Horner, who sought to create a cat breed that looked like a miniature panther. Although it took her many years, meticulously planned breedings of Burmese and American shorthair cats eventually resulted in a breed that bears the muscular build of a Burmese with a jet-black coat. Horner chose the name Bombay as a nod to India's storied black panther (think: Bagheera from the ), which was her inspiration for creating the new breed. </p><p>The Bombay inherited various traits from its two founding breeds. Its body resembles the Burmese but is slightly longer and less compact, and it is also curious and sociable like the Burmese. The Bombay's laid-back, ""go with the flow"" personality is credited to its American shorthair ancestry. </p><p>The Bombay was accepted for championship status with the Cat Fanciers Association in 1976. The International Cat Association accepted the Bombay in 1979. Today, the Bombay breed standards permit out-crosses with either sable Burmese or black American shorthairs.<br/></p><h2>Bombay Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Bombay's short, fine satiny coat couldn't be easier to groom. Simply brush this cat's fur once a week or rub it with a soft chamois cloth to bring out the coat's patent-leather shine.</p><p>The Bombay is a very clean cat that sheds very little. Occasional baths keep the coat looking and feeling soft and glossy. Trim the nails every two weeks or so, and peek inside your Bombay's ears every week or two to make sure they are not red or excessively dirty. Only clean your cat's ears if necessary to avoid disturbing their naturally healthy bacterial balance.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Bombay cat is playful and curious. Bombay kittens have seemingly endless amounts of energy, but as they age, they become more mellow and are happy to cuddle up on your lap after a brief bout of exploration and play.</p><p>Bombay cats are intelligent, so they appreciate puzzle toys, which encourage them to physically manipulate devices to get treats or food. Bombays are relatively trainable cats and sometimes behave a little like dogs. Some enjoy playing fetch and are comfortable walking on a leash and harness.<br/></p><p>Scratching is a natural behavior that's good for all cats' physical and mental health, but you want to show your cat the right places to scratch (not the couch!). Offer your Bombay a variety of acceptable surfaces for scratching, including vertical surfaces (scratching posts or cat trees) and horizontal surfaces (cardboard or sisal scratchers that lie on the floor).<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>When searching for a cat breeder, ask if they offer a health guarantee for their kittens.<br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Bombay has a stocky, muscular build and rounded head, resembling a mini leopard or jaguar. Its ears are medium-sized, and its large eyes range in color from rich gold to copper. The coat is fine and short, with a satin-like texture and shimmering, patent-leather sheen.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Obesity is a concern for all cats. Because the Bombay has a stocky build, it is vulnerable to weight gain. Staying lean helps prevent weight-related health issues like diabetes and arthritis, as well as heart disease, which affects the Bombay at higher rates than other breeds. </p><p>Free feeding (leaving food out all day) can lead to too much snacking and weight gain. Instead, serve measured amounts of food twice a day for adult cats (kittens should eat three to four smaller meals per day).

Unlike many domesticated cat breeds, it is extremely active and playful; it loves to climb tall pieces of furniture, tackle toys, and play interactive games with its owners. Friendly with children and other pets, the Abyssinian makes an excellent addition to an active family. It is recommended, however, to provide your Aby with a companion cat they're very social and can become bored if left alone for too long.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Aby</p><p>Personality: Friendly, interactive, animated, active, and playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 28 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Ruddy, red, blue, cinnamon, or fawn</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, ticked</p><p>Eye Color: Green or gold</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Somewhat</p><p>Origin: Indian Ocean coastal regions and parts of southeast Asia</p><h2>Characteristics of the Abyssinian</h2><p>The Abyssinian has a friendly and outgoing personality, so it loves to play and hates being alone. While this medium-sized cat is very social, its adaptable temperament and playful nature allow it to find fun in tackling toys or racing up and down stairs (or scratching posts) all by itself. Soon enough, though, an Aby will seek attention from its housemates, no matter the species. Full-grown around a year of age, the Abyssinian will maintain a kitten-like quality well into adulthood despite its elegant, refined appearance.</p><h2>History of the Abyssinian</h2><p>According to lore, Abyssinians were once owned by the Egyptian pharaohs, but some people claim they were developed in Britain by selective breeding of silver and brown tabby cats.</p><p>Since their mysterious premiere at the Crystal Palace Cat Show in 1871, genetic testing has determined that Abyssinians likely developed somewhere along the Indian Ocean's coastal regions and parts of southeast Asia. A taxidermied cat with the Aby's ruddy color and ticked markings at the Leiden Zoological Museum in the Netherlands supports this theory; the stuffed cat is thought to have hailed from India.</p><p>Many believe Abyssinians were given their name because Zula, the cat displayed at the 1871 Crystal Palace Cat Show, was allegedly imported from Abyssinia (present-day Ethiopia). Variations in the coat color and markings are likely the result of Abys breeding with other domesticated cats.</p><p>American cat fanciers began to import Abyssinians in 1900 but didn't start breeding programs until the 1930s. During this time, many cats were exported from Britain to the United States, which was fortunate because the breed was nearly wiped out in Europe during World War II.</p><p>Since then, Abyssinian populations have grown rapidly, and they've become one of the most popular cat breeds in the world.</p><h2>Abyssinian Care</h2><p>Despite their high exercise needs and energy levels, the Abyssinian can be a relatively low-maintenance cat. Because Abys have short coats and shed minimally, they don't need frequent grooming. Weekly combing and occasional baths can help remove dander, debris, and loose hair.</p><p>Like all cats, it's important to develop a regular oral health routine. Daily brushing is ideal, but even brushing once per week can help protect your cat from periodontal disease.</p><p>Check your Aby's ears weekly for dirt and debris, or signs of infection. You can clean dirt or waxy build-up with a soft, cotton cloth. Avoid cotton swabs, as they can damage the delicate inner-ear structures.</p><p>Abyssinians are active, playful cats that appreciate cat toys and interactive playtime. It's also a good idea to invest in a cat tree or wall-mounted shelves, so your cat has high places to climb and perch.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Abyssinian is a generally healthy cat, but a few conditions are common in the breed.</p><p>If you're concerned about your cat's health, talk to your veterinarian about the steps you can take to ensure she lives a long, happy, healthy life.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Abyssinian is a medium-sized cat with a lean, muscular build that is fully developed around one year of age. Its ears are relatively large, giving the cat a wild appearance similar to a savannah cat. The Aby's short and rather dense coat can range in color from ruddy, red, and cinnamon to blue or fawn (females with fawn coloration are rare and expensive). It's large, almond-shaped eyes can be green or gold.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your cat's dietary needs will depend largely on its age, sex, and activity levels. Consult the feeding guide from your favorite cat food brand, or talk to your veterinarian about how much to feed your Abyssinian. Remember: Overfeeding can lead to dangerous health conditions associated with obesity.</p><h2>Abyssinian Overview</h2><p>Abyssinian cats are very active and will generally thrive as indoor cats in larger homes as long as they have company and toys. They love to climb, so cat trees are appreciated by Abys (stairs and high surfaces are also fun to scale). Generally healthy and low maintenance, an Abyssinian is a relatively easy cat to care for throughout its 15-year lifespan.</p><p>Most importantly this breed craves attention and interaction with its humans and fellow household pets. If you're extremely busy and away from the home often, you may want to consider giving your Aby a companion cat that also loves to play.</p><p>Friendly to children and other pets</p><p>Playful with high energy levels</p><p>Low maintenance grooming</p><p>Needs exercise (playtime), which may be difficult for busy families</p><p>Prefers to have a companion cat</p><p>Sheds seasonally</p><h2>Where to Adopt an Abyssinian</h2><p>If you choose to purchase an Abyssinian from a breeder, conduct research to ensure they're ethical and responsible. An ethical breeder will work hard to uphold the breed standards and produce healthy cats. Be on the lookout for red flags, like multiple cats on-site or unhealthy cats. Never allow a breeder to ship a cat to your home or charge your payment online.</p>",935

This cat's short, dense hair is uniformly steel blue with an almost silvery cast, making it one of the most distinctive and beautiful cats in the world. Russian blues enjoy interacting and playing with their owners, but they also have an aloof quality that makes them less suitable for homes with rambunctious children or pets. Mellow dogs and gentle children are much preferred by this independent breed.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Friendly and intelligent but aloof, may be reclusive around strangers</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 24 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Steel blue</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid</p><p>Eye Color: Green</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Somewhat</p><p>Origin: Russia</p><h2>Russian Blue Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The Russian blue is a medium-sized cat when it reaches maturity at about a year old. It is friendly and enjoys being near familiar people in calm surroundings. If strangers, rowdy dogs, or overly affectionate kids approach, though, the Russian blue is likely to retreat for the safety of a hiding spot where it will stay until the environment has returned to normal.</p><h2>History of the Russian Blue Cat</h2><p>Although the Russian blue's full breed history is not known, these cats are thought to have originated on Archangel Island (Arkhangelsk) in northern Russia where they were once called Archangel cats. They were favored by the Russian czars.</p><p>Upon gaining popularity among the Russian royalty, the beautiful blue cats were shipped to many parts of Europe. Russian blues were among the contestants of the very first cat shows held in England in the 1880s.</p><p>In the United States, the Russian blue is recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association and The International Cat Association.</p><h2>Russian Blue Cat Care</h2><p>The Russian blue's trademark coat is easy to care for, requiring minimal grooming. Because it sheds less than other cats' coats, occasional brushing is optional. The Russian blue frequently appears on lists of ""hypoallergenic"" cat breeds. Although no cat breed is truly non-allergenic, it seems that some allergy sufferers can live successfully with certain cat breeds, including the Russian blue.</p><p>Trim your Russian blue's nails regularly and check inside the ears for dirt and debris on a weekly basis. If you see a little debris in the ears, use a gentle pet ear cleaner to wipe them out with a cotton ball ( a cotton swab).</p><p>Russian blues are intelligent cats. They are entertaining and playful and can be trained to play fetch. Although not a particularly vocal breed, they usually will respond when talked to and encouraged to ""talk"" back.</p><p>For exercise, make sure your cat has a scratching post for some necessary stretching. This breed can keep busy and exercise on its own, which is great for families that maintain a busy lifestyle. Regulate weight by controlling the portions of cat food. If your cat starts to get pudgy, reduce the food given and talk to your veterinarian about its diet.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Although some purebred cats are prone to certain hereditary diseases, the Russian blue is generally healthy with no known genetically linked disorders.</p><p>The breed enjoys a long life span, often living into the upper teens or longer. Work with your vet to make sure your Russian blue is up to date on its vaccines, annual exams, routine testing, and dental care.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Russian blue's trademark coat is a shimmery blue with a silvery cast. The short, dense, plush coat is wonderfully easy to care for, requiring minimal grooming. Its coat naturally does not shed much. Occasional brushing will keep the coat soft and silky.</p><p>Even more striking perhaps than the Russian blue's coat are its large, wide-set, emerald-green eyes. The wedged shape of the head and face gives the Russian blue a charming expression that makes it look like it is perpetually smiling.<br/></p><p>The medium-sized Russian blue cat is fine-boned and elegant, but ideally lean and muscular as well.<br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>It is always recommended that you speak with your veterinarian about the best food to feed your Russian blue. The Russian blue is known to love eating, so one thing to watch out for is overfeeding. Keeping your Russian blue lean is the best way to avoid weight-related health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis.</p><p>Feed your Russian blue measured amounts of cat food at regular meal times two to three times a day. Although leaving food out all day may be convenient, it can lead to constant snacking, which can contribute to an overweight cat. Always have fresh water available 24 hours a day.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Russian Blue Cat</h2><p>If you like the Russian blue cat and want to learn more, check out the Cat Fanciers' Association's list of Russian blue breeders near you so you can ask more questions and meet a Russian blues in person.</p><p>You can also try to find a cat show in your area.

The breed originated as a guard dog, and its enormous size is certainly imposing. Overall, it has a well-balanced, muscular build. Its head is very large and broad with almond-shaped eyes and triangular ears. And its neck has a fair amount of loose skin, which helps to protect more vulnerable internal areas. This dog can be a sweet companion and gentle giant with its family, but it does require an owner who's knowledgable in training and socialization to prevent it from becoming overprotective and aggressive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Working</p><p>Height: 28 to 35 inches</p><p>Weight: 140 to 200 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth double coat<br/></p><p>Coat Color: Black, fawn, red, wolfgray, or yellow with/without white and/or brindle markings</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 12 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, protective, alert</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Spain</p><h2>Characteristics of the Spanish Mastiff</h2><p>Spanish mastiffs generally have an affectionate and easygoing personality around their family. But wariness of strangers and even other dogs also can greatly impact their temperament. They don't bark excessively, but they will use their deep bark as an alert to perceived threats.</p><h2>History of the Spanish Mastiff</h2><p>The Spanish mastiff is an ancient dog breed whose ancestors date back more than 2,000 years to the Iberian Peninsula. Its exact origin is unknown. But this dog's primary role was to protect livestock from wolves and other threats. </p><p>Around the 10th century, sheep farming was one of Spain's main economic drivers. And the Spanish mastiff became even more valuable to defend the flocks. The dog was bred for its size and strength, as well as its alert nature. However, an official breed standard wasn't developed until the 1900s. </p><p>The breed remains rare today, especially outside of Spain. The American Kennel Club admitted the Spanish mastiff to its Foundation Stock Service in 2008, which helps to keep track of breeding.</p><h2>Spanish Mastiff Care</h2><p>The Spanish mastiff isn't a high-energy breed, but it still needs sufficient room for daily exercise. Its grooming requirements are fairly straightforward. But training and socialization should receive extra attention to ensure that the dog is friendly and well-mannered.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to give your dog at least an hour of physical activity each day. Walks, hikes, and vigorous games of fetch all are ideal activities. And puzzle toys can help to challenge your dog mentally.</p><p>It's ideal for this big dog to get some time to run around off leash in a securely fenced area. However, because the breed doesn't always get along well with other dogs, it might not be a good candidate for dog parks.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog's coat weekly to remove any loose fur and dirt. Expect periods of higher shedding often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to brush more frequently. In addition, bathe your dog every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. Spanish mastiffs tend to drool a lot. So it's a good idea to keep a drool cloth nearby, and be sure to keep the skin folds around your dog's neck clean and dry.</p><p>Furthermore, plan to trim your dog's nails roughly every month. Check its ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. And attempt to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socialization ideally when your Spanish mastiff is a puppy. An adult Spanish mastiff with poor manners can be very difficult to manage due to its size. A puppy class is a great way to teach basic commands and manners. Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, and keep training sessions fun and varied. </p><p>Furthermore, aim to expose your Spanish mastiff to a variety of people and other dogs starting from an early age. The more positive experiences it has, the less likely it will be for your dog to view strangers as threats.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Spanish mastiff is generally a healthy breed. It is not prone to any known hereditary health issues, though it still can face common health concerns that affect many dogs as they age, such as arthritis.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your Spanish mastiff. And feed it a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure that your dog is getting the correct amount. Moreover, the Spanish mastiff might benefit from a dog food that's formulated for large breeds. So be sure to discuss both the type of food and the amount with your veterinarian. Also, be mindful of treats and other extra food to help prevent excess weight gain, which can put too much stress on this big dog's joints.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Spanish Mastiff</h2><p>The Spanish mastiff is a rare breed. So it's unlikely but not impossible to find one available for adoption. You might have to wait some time and travel a great distance, depending on where you live. Breeders also can be difficult to come by. For a puppy from a responsible breeder, expect to pay around $1,200 to $1,800 on average.</p><h2>Spanish Mastiff Overview</h2><p>Loyal and protective </p><p>Gentle and loving with family</p><p>Doesn't need a lot of exercise</p><p>Needs extensive socialization</p><p>Drools a lot</p><p>Difficult breed to find</p>",856

Often called the Newfie, the breed is intelligent, sweet, and very loyal. They make for affectionate companions, and they naturally take to work in water rescue and other jobs. These dogs were bred for life on the water with a thick coat to insulate them and webbed paws for swimming. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Working</p><p>HEIGHT: 26 inches (female), 28 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 100 to 120 pounds (female), 130 to 150 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, brown, gray, white and black</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 9 to 10 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, sweet-tempered, gentle</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Canada</p><h2>Characteristics of the Newfoundland</h2><p>Newfoundlands generally have a very sweet personality, and they love people. They're even typically great around kids thanks to their calm and gentle temperament. Newfies have a moderate energy level and thus don't need an excessive amount of exercise and play each day.</p><h2>History of the Newfoundland</h2><p>The Newfoundland originates from the Canadian province of Newfoundland, where it has a rich history as a working dog. Dating back to the early 1800s, Newfies were used to assist fishermen, aid in water rescues, and haul fishing nets and carts. It is believed that the ancestors of Newfies were brought to Newfoundland by European fisherman. Although their exact lineage is widely debated, the most popular theory suggests that the Newfie evolved from Great Pyrenees dogs and black retrievers.</p><p>Newfoundlands made their way to England in the 1800s, where the bred was further refined. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1886.</p><p>There have been several famous Newfies throughout history. Explorers Lewis and Clark brought a Newfoundland named Seaman with them as they journeyed across the land. Other famous owners include Emily Dickinson, Ulysses S. Grant, Lyndon B. Johnson, Robert F. Kennedy, composer Richard Wagner, and ornithologist John James Audubon.</p><h2>Newfoundland Care</h2><p>Newfies have a strong drive to work and protect. They need daily exercise and proper training and socialization to ensure they are well-mannered dogs. Plus, their thick coat requires a moderate amount of grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Newfies should get at least a half hour to an hour of daily exercise to keep them fit and happy. Most love long walks and hikes, and they adore swimming. In addition, training in dog sports, such as dock diving, and other canine activities, such as search and rescue, can help satisfy their need for a job and provide both mental stimulation and physical activity.</p><p>While Newfoundlands generally do well in cold weather, their thick coat can cause them to overheat in hot weather. So keep outdoor activities short in the heat, and make sure your dog always has a place to go to cool down. For indoor play, Newfies should have a home that has space for them to move around freely.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Newfoundlands have a thick, medium-length double coat that serves as insulation from cold waters. Plan to brush at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent mats. Shedding can increase as the weather changes in the spring and fall, potentially requiring daily brushing to keep up with all the loose fur.</p><p>Baths will be required roughly every month or two unless your dog gets dirty. Many owners take their Newfie to a groomer because its large size can be difficult to manage in an at-home bath. The breed also can drool quite a bit and require regular cleanup with a damp cloth.</p><p>Moreover, nail trims will be necessary every month or so, depending on how much your dog naturally wears down its nails. And it's ideal to brush a Newfie's teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Newfies are intelligent dogs, and they respond fairly well to training. Their giant size makes both training and socialization essential, so you can maintain control of your dog. Aim to start early in puppyhood with basic obedience and exposing your Newfie to different people, other animals, and situations. Newfies learn well with lots of consistent and positive reinforcement; harsh methods can hinder training.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide fresh water for your Newfie. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced dog food typically in two meals per day. Discuss the variety and quantity with your vet, as this can vary based on age, activity level, and other factors. Newfies generally eat more than the average-size dog, so be prepared to have a high budget for dog food. However, always monitor your dog's weight and treat intake to ensure it's not overeating.</p><p>Like other deep-chested dog breeds, Newfoundlands can experience bloat and stomach torsion, which is a medical emergency. This can be the result of eating too quickly. To help prevent this condition, an option is to feed smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day. You also can slow eating with a puzzle toy.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Newfoundland</h2><p>Check local animal shelters and breed-specific rescue organizations for a Newfoundland in need of a home. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $2,000 to $3,000 on average, though this can vary widely depending on such factors as age and bloodline.</p><h2>Newfoundland Overview</h2><p>Loyal companion</p><p>Instincts to protect and assist</p><p>Generally calm and sweet</p><p>Requires spacious home</p><p>Large size can complicate grooming</p><p>Slobbery dog</p>",846

The dense coat insulates the Lapphund against extreme temperatures, allowing it to work as a herding dog for reindeer in cold Finnish climates. The breed sports triangular, upright ears and oval eyes, which sometimes feature markings around them that are referred to as ""spectacles."" Overall, this is an agile, alert dog that's capable of quick bursts of speed.

They love their family and can even be good around kids. High intelligence also helps to shape their personality, along with the ability to excel in training. </p><h2>History of the Finnish Lapphund</h2><p>The Finnish Lapphund got its name from Lapland, a region by the Arctic Circle where its spitz-type ancestors originated centuries ago. People there developed thick-coated dogs that they used first for hunting and then herding reindeer. </p><p>These dogs had to be nimble and quick to avoid the hooves and antlers of stubborn reindeer. Today's Lapphund still has a strong ""startle reflex,"" meaning it reacts quickly to movements and noises. </p><p>It wasn't until the mid-1900s that a breed standard was developed for the Finnish Lapphund. And the American Kennel Club didn't recognize it as a breed until 2011. It's not very common in North America but is still popular in Finland. It even continues to work as a reindeer herder, though not as frequently as it once did.</p><h2>Finnish Lapphund Care</h2><p>Finnish Lapphunds prefer to be active with their owners, so plan on some exercise every day. They also need regular grooming, as well as consistent training and socialization.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least an hour per day exercising your Finnish Lapphund. These dogs aren't as high energy as many other herding dogs, but they still like to be active. Daily walks, jogging, hiking, and vigorous play sessions all are ideal ways to get out some of their energy. And puzzle toys can provide mental challenges. Finnish Lapphunds also can excel at dog sports, including agility and herding trials.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your Finnish Lapphund's coat at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles. Plan on periods of higher shedding often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to brush up to daily to keep up with the loose fur. Never shave your dog, as that can harm the coat's ability to keep the dog warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. </p><p>Finnish Lapphunds don't typically have an odor. But still plan on a bath every month or so, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Check your dog's ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. And trim its nails roughly every month. Also, aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your Finnish Lapphund ideally when it's a puppy. A puppy obedience class can help it learn both basic commands and manners. Plus, aim to expose your puppy to different people, other dogs, and various locations to help boost its comfort and confidence.</p><p>Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. These dogs are generally smart and learn quickly, as long as training sessions are positive and fun. </p><p>You might have to work extra on teaching your dog to be comfortable when left alone. Finnish Lapphunds prefer to be with their humans and might develop separation anxiety when alone for long periods. A professional dog trainer or behaviorist can give you tips to help combat this. But this breed is best for a household where someone is home for most of the day. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure fresh water is accessible for your dog. And offer a high-quality canine diet with balanced nutrition, typically via two measured meals per day.

Also, be mindful of treats to prevent overeating and excess weight gain.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Finnish Lapphund</h2><p>The Finnish Lapphund is not a very common dog breed in North America, but it's still worth checking animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home.

People are often preferred, but oriental longhairs also appreciate the companionship of other cats and gentle dogs.</p><h2>History of the Oriental Longhair</h2><p>Oriental cats can be categorized as long or short-haired, with the short-haired variety being much more common. While it is rumored that an early version of the oriental longhair was developed in Turkey in the 19th century, the introduction of the popular Persian cat rendered the lesser-known long-haired cat obsolete.</p><p>In the mid-20th century, breeders wanted to develop Siamese-like cats with a greater variety of coat colors and patterns. They began crossing Siamese with other breeds like Russian blues, British shorthairs, and Abyssinians. This was how the oriental cat was first born, and by the 1970s, they were being imported to the United States where they became incredibly popular.</p><p>The oriental shorthair cat was recognized as a breed by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1977, not yet accepting the longhair as a distinct breed. The International Cat Association (ICA) recognized the oriental longhair as a breed in its own right in 1979, but it wasn't until 1995 that the CFA officially added the longhair to its listing.</p><p>While the short and long-haired varieties are similar in temperament, the longhair has a more lustrous, silky coat, and has an impressive plumed tail. This breed is sometimes also referred to as the British angora, which it was called until the early 21st century.</p><h2>Oriental Longhair Care</h2><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The oriental longhair has a lot of energy, so it loves to explore, play games, and tackle toys. One fun way to interact with this curious kitty (and keep its brain busy) is training. As far as cats go, this breed is surprisingly trainable. The longhair is incredibly smart and inquisitive and responds well to positive reinforcement training methods. This will strengthen the bond you have with your cat while keeping it stimulated and entertained.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The oriental longhair does not have a double coat so, even though the hair is long, it doesn't require the intensive grooming of longer-haired breeds like the Persian. A good brush-out once a week to remove dead hairs should suffice.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The oriental longhair looks similar to a Siamese, with its triangular heads, large ears, and almond-shaped eyes. But, the longhair has an even lankier and more slender body with a long, plumed tail.</p><p>The breed is also known for its vast array of coat colors and patterns. At close to 300 variations, the oriental longhair offers significantly more variety than any other breed except its short-haired counterpart.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The breed is prone to periodontal disease, presumably because its long, slim face and jaw contribute to accumulated bacteria and plaque. It is important to feed high-quality food, preferably dry food in addition to canned, to help remove build-up. Tooth brushing if your cat tolerates it as well as veterinary dental cleanings can also be beneficial.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Oriental Longhair</h2><p>Seeking out a reputable breeder will help to ensure that your kitten is healthy and well socialized when you bring it home. Make sure that you do a ton of research before deciding if an oriental longhair is the right cat for you (remember, this is a very vocal breed). Talk to other owners, breeders, and breed clubs to get more information.</p><p>A good place to start your research is through the Cat Fanciers' Association's list of recognized breeders.</p><p>Adopting a cat can be hugely rewarding, so you can try reaching out to your local shelter or searching Petfinder for an oriental longhair. While these pure-bred cats are not extremely common, you never know when one might be abandoned and need a home.<br/></p><h2>Oriental Longhair Overview</h2><p>Oriental longhairs share many traits with their Siamese relatives. They are exceptionally curious and clever and, unless you keep them appropriately stimulated, they can get into mischief to entertain themselves. For this reason, they are best suited to households where they will have plenty of company.</p><p>Their affectionate and amiable personality means they also thrive among families with respectful kids as well as multi-pet households. If introductions are done properly, it is not uncommon for an oriental longhair and a dog to become fast friends.</p><p>Affectionate and sociable</p><p>Enjoys the company of children and other animals</p><p>Playful and intelligent</p><p>Very vocal</p><p>Needs a lot of company and stimulation</p><p>Prone to periodontal disease</p>",928

Native to upstate New York, and born in a barn, the wirehair carries a natural genetic mutation that creates its unique wiry coat. Although it is generally wary of strangers, this cat reserves its affection for its family and makes a great pet for a loving, laid-back home with plenty of opportunities for exploration and play.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Quiet, affectionate, shy with strangers, energetic, and playful</p><p>Weight: Up to 8 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 15 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Medium hair</p><p>Coat Colors: White, black, blue, red, cream, silver,</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby, tortoiseshell, calico, bicolor</p><p>Eye Color: Gold or blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 20 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>American Wirehair Characteristics</h2><p>Known for being shy or reserved with unfamiliar people, the American wirehair may take its time getting to know you. But, once you're friends, this cat's true personality shines through. The wirehair is extremely affectionate and friendly with its family and can be quite silly and kittenish. While this breed has a generally calm, quiet temperament, it also has a lot of energy for exploring and playing. According to the International Cat Association (TICA), the American wirehair is extremely tolerant of children.</p><h2>History of the American Wirehair</h2><p>The discovery of this breed can be traced back to 1966 when, on a farm in upstate New York, a domestic shorthair barn cat had a litter of kittens from which only two survived. The little ginger-and-white male kitten caught the farmer's eye because of his unusually wiry coat.</p><p>The farmer contacted a reputable local breeder to come and take a look, and she was also surprised by the kitten's appearance. She bought both kittens to attempt to replicate the wiry coat characteristic in her breeding program with American shorthair cats.</p><p>The kitten's wiry hair is believed to have occurred as a result of a rare spontaneous mutation. It is a dominant gene mutation, meaning that at least half the kittens born from a parent with wiry hair will also be born with wirehair coats. Interestingly, the wirehair mutation has not been reported in cats from any other country in the world.</p><p>The American wirehair cat breed was promptly recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1967 and was accepted for championship competition in 1978. The breed was registered with the International Cat Association (TICA) in 1979. Although still relatively rare, the breed is now being propagated across the United States and is well-loved by its enthusiasts.</p><h2>American Wirehair Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The coarse coat of the American wirehair is low maintenance. It does not shed much, so a gentle weekly brushing will suffice to remove any loose hair. Take care not to rake through the coat too vigorously because the wiry hair may break more easily than the smooth coats of other cat breeds.</p><p>The wirehair's ears tend to accumulate a bit of wax, presumably because of coarse hairs growing just inside the ears. If you inspect them weekly and use a gentle ear cleanser when necessary, the ears should remain healthy and infection-free.</p><p>Routine nail trims and dental cleanings will also help keep an American wirehair in tip-top shape.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The American wirehair is not a breed that is content with just lying around on your lap all day. While wirehairs do enjoy affection, they are also agile and energetic. They thrive on exercise and enrichment to keep them from becoming bored.</p><p>If you are away from home most of the day, then the American wirehair may not be the best breed for your situation. These cats enjoy being surrounded by familiar company, including respectful children and even family dogs too, providing they are introduced carefully.</p><p>While this breed is not known for being vocal, it is a prolific ""purrer,"" so you will have no trouble recognizing that your kitty is content.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The American wirehair is one of the healthiest cat breeds. They have been bred via a rigorous and reputable breeding program that is dedicated to perpetuating their hardy genetics.<br/></p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The American wirehair is a small to medium-sized cat with a rounded head, medium-sized ears, and large eyes. While similar in appearance to the American shorthair, the wirehair's coat and more prominent cheekbones give it a distinctive appearance.</p><p>The springy, rough nature of the American wirehair's coat can vary according to the texture of the parents' coats. Some have slightly smoother coats; others can be quite coarse. The cats that are considered the best in the breed have hard, wiry hair all over their bodies.</p><p>The colors and patterns of the American wirehair breed can vary widely according to breed standards. The only exclusions are chocolate, lavender, and a Himalayan pattern.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like any cat, the American wirehair should be fed a high-quality diet. Cats are natural carnivores and, as such, they need a high protein diet with a careful balance of vitamins and minerals.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an American Wirehair</h2><p>In general, American wirehair breeders are known for being very responsible the trouble is finding one. The CFA and TICA maintain breeder lists but currently feature no listings for the American wirehair cat. Because this breed is still relatively rare and has few breeders, you may be subject to a waiting list when you locate a source.</p><h2>American Wirehair Overview</h2><p>The rare American wirehair cat has a uniquely coarse coat that sets it apart from the rest of its kind. It is a shy cat, at first, but it bonds deeply with its family and loves children. The breed has no specific health problems and is low maintenance in terms of grooming. The only problem with this cat is finding one because breeders are few and far between.</p><p>Affectionate and playful</p><p>Quiet</p><p>No genetic health issues</p><p>Rare (few breeders)</p><p>Needs a lot of attention</p><p><br/></p>",952

Contrary to its tough appearance, the Stafford is a gentle, loyal, and highly affectionate dog breed and was recognized by the American Kennel Club in the 1970s.</p><p>Praised for its ""nanny-like"" instincts, the Stafford gets along remarkably well with children when properly trained and socialized. However, because of this breed's strong prey drive and dog-fighting ancestry, use caution around other pets.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h2><p>Overall, Staffordshire bull terriers have friendly, gentle dispositions and make lovely companions for many types of households. If raised together, well-trained, and closely supervised, this breed may even learn to get along with other animals beautifully, but some of Staffies will be best suited for a one-pet household.</p><h2>History of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h2><p>The Staffordshire bull terrier was developed in England during the 19th century for dogfighting. To create a faster and more compact dog breed, bulldogs were crossed with small terriers, most likely Manchester terriers and similar breeds. At the time, bulldogs were large, fierce, and intrepid, much different than today's bulldog.</p><p>Before landing on its current name, Staffords have been called bull-and-terrier dogs, bulldog terriers, and old pit bull terriers. Once dogfighting was made illegal during the early 20th century, Staffords became more widely recognized as loyal and affectionate companion dogs.</p><p>The Staffordshire bull terrier was brought to the U.S. towards the end of the 19th century but was not officially recognized by the American Kennel Club until 1974.</p><h2>Staffordshire Bull Terrier Care</h2><p>Staffordshire bull terriers should never be walked off-leash as they can be aggressive with unknown dogs and will chase any small animals they consider to be prey. They are unlikely to do well at free-run dog parks. These strong dogs will need training to avoid pulling on the leash, but they need little to average grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Stafford is an athletic dog breed with plenty of energy, so routine exercise is essential. Give your dog an hour total of vigorous walking daily. Be careful not to overdo it in warmer weather, as the breed is typically sensitive to heat. Staffords will especially benefit from dog sports that challenge them mentally and physically. A securely fenced yard is a good play area, but be aware that the Stafford is a terrier and will dig an escape tunnel if able. You may wish to reinforce the bottom of fences.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The short, smooth coat of the Stafford requires little more than routine grooming. This breed tends to shed at a low to moderate rate, though shedding does increase seasonally. Keep the nails neatly trimmed for healthy, comfortable feet.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>As with any dog breed, proper training is a must for the Staffy. This is a very intelligent dog breed that can be stubborn, following its own will if permitted. Therefore, obedience training is essential to manage your dog and provide structure. Socialization is just as important, so your dog will be comfortable in all kinds of situations.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Responsible breeders strive to maintain the highest breed standards as established by kennel clubs like the AKC. Dogs bred by these standards are less likely to develop hereditary conditions. However, some hereditary health problems can occur in the Staffordshire bull terrier breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The Staffordshire bull terrier should be fed two meals a day of dry dog food. Each feeding should be a maximum of 1 cup of food. A dog's individual needs will be determined by age, activity level, and health conditions. It's best not to exercise your dog for an hour after eating in order to help reduce the risk of bloating and stomach torsion.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Staffordshire Bull Terrier</h2><p>Staffordshire bull terriers may be available at local shelters or with rescue groups. They can cost a few hundred dollars as a rescue or cost an average of $2,000 from a breeder. Check with breed-specific rescue groups to see if they have information on Staffies in your area.</p><h2>Staffordshire Bull Terrier Overview</h2><p>Minimal grooming</p><p>Loyal, kind, and protective of children</p><p>Affectionate and playful</p><p>Needs a lot of exercise but are also sensitive to heat</p><p>May be aggressive toward other animals and may need to be in a one-pet household</p><p>Tends to chew and dig, especially as puppies</p>",704

It is a close relative of the smooth-coat vizsla but is a bit hardier largely thanks to its thick, protective coat. These dogs are generally lively but gentle, and they are strong athletes. They are comfortable on land and in water. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 21.5 to 23 inches (female), 23 to 25 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 55 pounds (female), 55 to 65 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Short, wiry, thick</p><p>COAT COLOR: Golden rust</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Loyal, affectionate, gentle</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Hungary</p><h2>Characteristics of the Wirehaired Vizsla</h2><p>Wirehaired vizslas typically have a very affectionate personality. They can even be good with kids and strangers. Their temperament also is marked by their high energy and intelligence. They like a lot of physical activity and mental stimulation.</p><h2>History of the Wirehaired Vizsla</h2><p>The traditional smooth-coat vizsla can trace its history all the way back to the 800s. People in what's now Hungary bred their dogs to be quick, agile, and powerful. They also bred for loyal temperaments that made their hunting dogs trainable and eager to please. </p><p>Wirehaired vizslas didn't arrive on the scene until the 1930s. Hunters in Hungary wanted a dog like the vizsla that could better withstand cold weather, icy waters, and rugged terrain. Breeders crossed vizslas with German wirehaired pointers, among other dogs. The eventual result was a sturdy dog with a dense coat.</p><p>Wirehaired vizslas made their way to North America in the 1970s. But the American Kennel Club didn't recognize the breed until 2014. It still remains rare around the world. </p><h2>Wirehaired Vizsla Care</h2><p>Wirehaired vizslas need lots of exercise and mental stimulation every day, but they have minimal grooming needs. They also require training and socialization from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These high-energy dogs should receive at least one to two hours per day of exercise. And rather than just letting them loose in a fenced area, they would prefer to be active with their humans. They love long walks, running, hiking, cycling, and swimming. Dog sports, such as agility and dock diving, also are ideal to challenge them mentally and physically.</p><p>Make sure always to keep your dog on a leash or in a securely fenced area when you're out and about. This breed has a high prey drive and can quickly take off to follow perceived prey if it's not contained.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The wiry coat of a wirehaired vizsla doesn't tend to get dirty easily, and it doesn't shed much. Plan on a monthly bath, depending on how dirty your dog gets. You can use a damp cloth in between baths to freshen up the coat. Also, run a grooming mitt or brush over the coat every week or so to remove loose fur. And once or twice a year plan to strip the coat to remove dead fur.</p><p>Check your dog's nails roughly once a month to see whether they're due for a trim. And aim to brush its teeth daily. Also, look in its ears at least weekly and especially after swimming for any wax buildup, debris, and other abnormalities. Be sure to dry the ears well after swimming, too.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Wirehaired vizslas are generally eager to please and take well to training. But they also are sensitive dogs. So you must use positive training methods; harsh corrections can cause them to shut down and not learn. Start training from as young of an age as possible, keeping sessions short and fun. </p><p>Also, socialize your dog from a young age by exposing it to different people, other dogs, and various situations. You also might have to work on making your dog comfortable with being left alone for stretches. Wirehaired vizslas typically always want to be by your side and thus are prone to separation anxiety. They do best in a home where someone is with them for most of the day. <br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The wirehaired vizsla is overall a healthy dog breed. But it's still prone to some genetic health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always make sure your dog has access to fresh water. And feed a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's common to feed two measured meals per day. But discuss both the type of diet and the amount with your vet. High-energy dogs like the wirehaired vizsla often require a more nutrient-dense diet. But you still need to be mindful of treats and other extra food to prevent overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Wirehaired Vizsla</h2><p>While this breed isn't common in the United States, it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups for a wirehaired vizsla in need of a home. If you're looking for a reputable breeder puppy, expect to pay around $1,000 to $4,000, though this can vary widely. You also might have to wait a while for a puppy, as there aren't many breeders. </p><h2>Wirehaired Vizsla Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and loyal</p><p>Intelligent and eager to please</p><p>Low-maintenance grooming</p><p>Needs lots of exercise and enrichment</p><p>Can be prone to separation anxiety</p><p>Can have a high prey drive</p>",837
259,https://www.thesprucepets.com/siberian-cat-4178148,Cats > Cat Breeds > Long-Haired Cat Breeds,<h1>Siberian Cat: Cat Breed Profile</h1>,"<h1>Siberian Cat: Cat Breed Profile</h1><h2>Characteristics, History, Care Tips, and Helpful Information for Pet Owners</h2><p>The Siberian cat is a medium-sized, semi-longhaired cat that is both breathtaking to behold and an affectionate pet. Siberian is a forest cat native to snowy Russia, where it needed its luxurious triple coat to protect against cold. This breed has a delightful personality outgoing, affectionate, friendly, and energetic making it an exceptional feline companion. They enjoy the company of other cats and even dogs and are good with gentle, respectful children.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 15 to 20 pounds</p><p>Length: 17 to 25 inches</p><p>Coat: Varies from coarse to soft; moderately long to longhaired triple coat with a full collar ruff</p><p>Coat Color: Any color combination or pattern</p><p>Eye Color: All colors</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 18 years</p><h2>Characteristics of the Siberian Cat</h2><h2>History of the Siberian Cat</h2><p>Siberian cats hail from Russia, where they are cherished as a national treasure. It's hard to say just how long Siberian cats have existed in Russia, but based on Russian fairy tales and children's books, they have likely been around for hundreds of years and maybe as long as 1,000 years.</p><p>Siberian cats were described in a book called ""Our Cats and All About Them""by Harrison Weir, which was originally published in 1889. The United States got their first glimpse of the Siberian cat after the Cold War thawed in the 1990s, and it was love at first sight. The Siberian cat is recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association and The International Cat Association.</p><p>The Siberian cat's trademark sweet expression comes from its modified wedge head with rounded contours, moderately short muzzle with slight curvature, and medium-to-large, almost round eyes, which come in shades of green, gold, green-gold, or copper (white cats may have blue eyes or ""odd eyes,"" eyes that are two different colors).</p><h2>Siberian Cat Care</h2><p>The Siberian cat is intelligent and exceptionally playful. The breed is known to be slow to mature, taking as long as five years to graduate from kitten-like antics. This means the Siberian cat is a lot of fun to have around.</p><p>This breed loves to climb, explore, and play. To keep your Siberian cat mentally stimulated and physically enriched, expose it to a variety of fun toys and play lots of games.</p><p>Trim its nails regularly and inspect its ears for dirt and debris. Wipe the ears out with a cotton ball and gentle ear cleanser. Never stick a cotton swab or anything else down into the ear canal. If the ears look red or excessively dirty, schedule a checkup with your veterinarian.</p><p>The Siberian cat's luxurious, thick, full coat may come in any color or pattern, with or without white markings. The triple coat is made up of three layers: a shorter, dense undercoat of downy hair (the hair closest to the skin); a layer of slightly longer ""awn hair"" in the middle, and an even longer outer coat layer (called ""guard hair"").</p><p>In warm weather, the Siberian cat will shed the heavy coat in favor of a shorter, thinner summer coat. In winter, the coat will be at its thickest and longest. Despite its thickness and length, the Siberian cat's coat tends to resist matting, so it only requires occasional brushing (more during the seasonal heavy shed).</p><p>Occasional baths will help loose hair come out and remove dust and dander from the coat.</p><p>Even with its thick, long coat, some consider the Siberian cat to be hypoallergenic. Although no scientific studies prove it, some allergy sufferers say that they can live successfully with a Siberian cat. As it turns out, cat dander, urine, and saliva, not necessarily cat hair itself, is the main culprit for allergies.</p><p>Most cat-allergic people are sensitive to a protein called Fel D1, which is found in cats' skin cells (as well as dried remnants of saliva and urine that coat the cat's fur). It seems that some cat breeds, including Siberian cats, produce less dander than other cats.</p><p>For mild allergy sufferers, this might mean that Siberian cats elicit little or no allergic reaction. However, all cats and all people are different. If you suffer from allergies and are interested in finding out if you will react to a Siberian cat, find a local breeder who will allow you to visit their adult cats to test the theory.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a form of heart disease that causes thickening of the heart muscle, is more prevalent in certain breeds, including Siberians. Mutations of several cardiac (heart) genes have been identified in some cats with this disease, which suggests that genetics plays a role.</p><p>Responsible breeders screen their cats for this disease to avoid breeding affected cats and passing it along to future generations.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Work with your veterinarian to choose the best food for your Siberian cat. Although dry food is convenient, canned food contains fewer carbs and has a lot of extra moisture. Most cats don't drink enough water, which can affect their overall health, including their kidney health. Feed measured amounts of food at scheduled times, two to three times a day. Don't leave food out all day, as this can contribute to an overweight cat.</p><p>Potentially hypoallergenic for some allergy sufferers</p><p>Affectionate, playful, and energetic; gets along well with children and other animals</p><p>Can handle colder weather and likes water play</p><p>Long hair requires more grooming than other cats; sheds winter coat in warmer months</p><p>A little noisemaker that likes to mew, chirp, and trill a lot</p>",882

These bright-eyed, muscular cats are highly sociable and intelligent and love to jump and play. While the elf cat requires no brushing, its grooming regimen can be demanding, as lacking fur requires different cleaning practices. Elf cats have existed for less than 20 years, so there is still a lot left to be understood about the breed, but rest assured, they make for excellent pets and offer years and years of loyal companionship. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: n/a</p><p>Personality: Sociable, intelligent, affectionate</p><p>Weight: 10 to 15 pounds</p><p>Length: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Hairless</p><p>Coat Colors: Grey, black, beige, pink</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, spotted</p><p>Eye Color: All colors</p><p>Lifespan: Eight to fourteen years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Elf Cat</h2><p>The elf cat has a friendly, gentle personality, can quickly adapt to most household settings and family structures, and tend to get along with other pets in the home. They are intelligent and playful and are known to demand attention. Elf cats are best for owners who can give their pets ample attention. Potential elf cat owners should know that these cats love to climb onto high surfaces, so a stimulating play environment and high lounging spots are a must. Elf cats usually stop growing at one year of age.</p><h2>History of the Elf Cat</h2><p>Because the Elf cat is a new and extremely rare breed, its history is somewhat limited. Breeders Karen Nelson and Kristen Leedom are considered to be the elf cat's creators when, in 2004, they came together with a vision of breeding a cat with curled ears that retained the personality and physical attributes of their beloved sphynx cats. The elf cat was successfully developed by crossing the sphynx and American curl, yielding a hairless cat with curled ears.</p><p>Although the elf cat has been around for less than 20 years, it has made its mark in cat shows run by TICA (The International Cat Association). Still, the elf cat isn't recognized as a breed of its own but rather a variation on the sphynx.</p><h2>Elf Cat Care</h2><p>Understanding how best to care for your cat improves its quality of life. The elf cat's exercise needs are straightforward, but, contrary to what you may assume, hairless cats have more grooming needs than cats with coats.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The exercise needs of an elf cat are standard to those of most domestic cats. Because hairless breeds are indoor cats, make sure to provide them with a stimulating play environment. It's advised to give your cat 15 minutes of active playtime every day, but creating surfaces for independent climbing and jumping will also help your cat get out some of its energy on its own.<br/></p><h3>Shedding</h3><p>Because the elf cat is hairless, owners won't need to worry about shedding. But, even if your cat has no fur, it still produces dander. A hairless cat is close to hypoallergenic, but an allergen-sensitive owner may still be affected.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Even though elf cats don't have fur, they require frequent baths and wipe-downs. Regular grooming is essential to remove secretions from the skin. Otherwise, an elf cat can become sticky to the touch or develop skin issues. Hairless cats perform some self-grooming, but due to their many folds, there are crevices they can't reach on their own. You should also moisturize your elf cat using a chemical-free product that contains SPF, as hairless cats are especially prone to sunburns.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The elf cat is considered a healthy cat, but as a newer breed, some genetic health issues have yet to be determined. Most health problems related to the elf cat are due to its hairlessness.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The medium to large elf cat has a hairless, athletic, muscular body and prominent cheekbones, similar to the sphynx, and its eyes range from blue to gold. The elf cat's whiskers and eyebrows are sparse and short, and its skin is wrinkled around the shoulders, ears, and muzzle. Its unique ears curl backward, an effect caused by a genetic mutation. This mutation causes some ear furnishings to be missing. The elf cat is so genetically close to its sphynx parent that most of its physical traits, save for its ears, are the same.<br/></p><p>Due to the newness of the cat, there is no breed standard. This means all variations of elf cat colors and patterns are considered normal.<br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>To maintain proper body temperature, hairless cats need to burn calories constantly. This means that the elf cat requires a high-calorie diet to stay warm. Elf cat owners should know that both the sphynx and American curl have robust appetites, so feeding these cats a proper, balanced diet is critical. Consult your vet to determine the right amount of food for your cat.<br/></p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Elf Cat</h2><p>Elf cats are very rare, and it is doubtful that you will find one in a shelter. Instead, visit an elf cat breeder to purchase a cat for upwards of $2000. </p><h2>Elf Cat Overview</h2><p>The gentle, playful elf cat makes for an excellent companion.

There's feathering on the ears, chest and stomach, legs, and tail. And typically the tan is on the muzzle and throat, lower legs, eyebrows, and rear. The breed's coat served to protect it from the terrain and weather as a hunting dog in Scotland. These dogs are still natural athletes, and they tend to be quite devoted to their humans.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 23 to 26 inches (female), 24 to 27 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 45 to 70 pounds (female), 55 to 80 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Medium-length double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black and tan</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 13 years</p><p>Temperament: Energetic, affectionate, courageous</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Scotland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Gordon Setter</h2><p>Gordon setters generally have a loyal and affectionate temperament with their owners. They are quite smart and eager to please. A high energy level also helps to shape their personality, and they need lots of exercise every day.</p><h2>History of the Gordon Setter</h2><p>The Gordon setter can trace its ancestors back to the 1600s, but the breed really started to take shape during the 1800s. People in Scotland and around the United Kingdom wanted a bird-hunting dog that would ""set,"" or quietly lie down when it located prey. Different setter breeds arose with the Gordon being the heaviest of the bunch, suitable for the rugged landscape in Scotland. </p><p>Alexander Gordon, the fourth Duke of Gordon, bred what were then called black and tan setters at the kennels of Gordon Castle. These dogs initially resembled the English setter. But adding other breeds, including black and tan collies, bloodhounds, black pointers, and black setters, helped to shape the modern Gordon setter. </p><p>The breed first arrived in the United States in 1842. And the American Kennel Club first recognized it in 1878. The breed's official name went from the black and tan setter to the Gordon Castle setter and finally to the Gordon setter in 1924.</p><h2>Gordon Setter Care</h2><p>Plan to spend ample time exercising this athletic breed. Gordon setters also need regular grooming to prevent tangles and mats. And they should receive training and socialization from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least two hours per day exercising your Gordon setter. These dogs were bred to run and have good endurance. You can meet their exercise needs via long walks, jogging, cycling, hiking, and vigorous playtime. Dog sports also can provide mental challenges as well as physical activity. </p><p>Be sure always to keep your dog on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. This breed has a high prey drive and might ignore your recall efforts if it sees prey it wants to chase.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog's coat at least once or twice per week to remove loose fur and prevent mats and tangles. Pay special attention to the areas with feathering, as they tend to tangle easily. Expect periods of higher shedding often in the spring and fall, during which you should increase your brushing frequency. </p><p>Bathe your dog roughly once a month, depending on how dirty it gets. And check its nails monthly to see whether they're due for a trim. Plus, look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. And brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training and socialization should ideally begin when your Gordon setter is a puppy. A puppy class can help to teach your dog basic commands and manners. This breed typically responds well to training, especially when positive-reinforcement methods are used. </p><p>Moreover, allow your Gordon setter to meet different people and other dogs from an early age. This will help to curb its reserved nature around strangers. The breed is moderately good with other dogs but might perceive smaller household pets as prey.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>This breed is generally healthy, but it is prone to some hereditary health issues, including: </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your Gordon setter. And provide a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. Discuss both the type of food and the amount with your veterinarian. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But this breed is prone to bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twisting, which can arise from eating too quickly. An option to help prevent this is feeding smaller, more frequent meals. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Gordon Setter</h2><p>Gordon setters are a somewhat common dog breed, so it is possible to find one in need of a home at an animal shelter or rescue group. You just might have to wait for longer than you would with the highly popular breeds. See whether you can get your name on a breed wait list at your local shelters. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $800 to $2,000 on average.</p><h2>Gordon Setter Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and loyal</p><p>Typically responds well to training</p><p>Good for an active owner</p><p>Needs lots of daily exercise</p><p>Typically not ideal for an apartment</p><p>High prey drive</p>",827

It's not an extremely high-energy dog like many other sporting breeds. But it still needs a fair amount of exercise.</p><h2>History of the Spinone Italiano</h2><p>The exact origin of the Spinone Italiano is unknown. But its ancestors likely have been present in Italy for hundreds of years. The breed is possibly a mix of coarse-coated Italian setters with white mastiffs, French griffons, and other dogs.</p><p>What resulted was a reliable hunting dog with an excellent nose. It could work in all types of weather and terrain, including water. And its thick, wiry coat served to protect it from the thorny vegetation that's found throughout Italy's Piedmont region where the modern Spinone developed.</p><p>The breed still remains fairly uncommon around the world. The Spinone Club of America formed in 1987, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized the breed in 2000.</p><h2>Spinone Italiano Care</h2><p>This breed enjoys being active with its humans every day. It does have some involved grooming needs to maintain its wiry coat. And it should receive training and socialization from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan on at least an hour or two of exercise per day for a Spinone Italiano. These dogs prefer to be active with you, rather than being left to their own devices. Walks, jogging, hiking, and swimming all are great ways to exercise your dog. Plus, dog sports, such as agility and tracking, can provide mental and physical challenges. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Spinone Italiano's coat should be brushed at least weekly to remove loose fur and dirt. The wiry fur doesn't need trimming. But it should be hand-stripped periodically to remove dead hair. </p><p>Plan on a bath roughly once a month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. And see whether it needs its ears cleaned at least weekly. Also, make sure its ears are dried well after swimming and baths. Check whether its nails need trimming about every month, and brush its teeth daily with a canine toothpaste.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>This breed is smart but can be stubborn about obeying commands. Aim to begin training during puppyhood to prevent bad habits and instill good manners. Use positive reinforcement, such as treats and praise. And be consistent in your commands; don't let bad behaviors slide. </p><p>Moreover, begin socializing your dog when it's a puppy. Expose it to new people, other dogs, and various locations to boost its comfort and confidence. </p><p>One area you might have to work extra on is leaving your dog home alone. The breed prefers to be around its family and thus is prone to separation anxiety. It's best for a household where someone is home for most of the day.

Its temperament also is marked by its moderate energy level and high intelligence, making exercise and mental stimulation a must.</p><h2>History of the Czech Sheepdog</h2><p>The Czech sheepdog can trace its roots back all the way to the 14th century in what's now the Czech Republic. People bred them to be loyal guard dogs for their property and family. And they used them for herding and other farm work. </p><p>The dogs were developed for their family-friendly temperament and working abilities rather than looks. The breed remained rare throughout the centuries and largely limited to the Czech Republic lands. </p><p>In the 1980s, a breed standard finally was established, with the first puppies bred according to this standard being born in 1985. It wasn't until 2019 that the American Kennel Club accepted the breed into its Foundation Stock Service, a program that keeps track of rare purebred dogs.</p><h2>Czech Sheepdog Care</h2><p>Czech sheepdogs prefer an active lifestyle, and they generally take well to training. Their medium-length coat does shed a moderate amount, but grooming it is fairly easy.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Czech sheepdogs enjoy being active and should receive at least an hour of exercise per day. Ideal activities include walks, jogging, hiking, and vigorous games of fetch. Dog sports, such as agility and herding, also are great ways to burn both mental and physical energy. When they receive sufficient exercise, Czech sheepdogs are typically calm in the house and happy to cuddle on the couch.</p><p>It's important to keep in mind that due to this breed's heavy coat, it doesn't tolerate hot weather well. So limit outdoor exercise sessions in the heat.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Plan to brush your dog's coat at least once a week to remove loose fur and prevent tangles and mats. Your dog will likely experience seasonal periods of higher shedding, often in the spring and fall, at which time you should increase your brushing frequency to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>A bath roughly once a month should suffice, depending on how dirty your dog gets.

But they also have a protective streak to their personality that makes them only moderately open to strangers. In addition, their high energy level makes them very bright and alert dogs.</p><h2>History of the Chesapeake Bay Retriever</h2><p>The Chesapeake Bay retriever can trace its roots to, naturally, the Chesapeake Bay area of Maryland and Virginia in the early 1800s. Waterfowl hunters in the region needed an athletic dog that could retrieve their game swimming in frigid waters. </p><p>Various breeds, including the Newfoundland, Irish water spaniel, and hounds, went into creating the Chessie. What arose was a dog with a thick, oily coat that repelled water and insulated the dog from the cold. It had excellent stamina, a wide chest that could break through ice in the water, strong legs for swimming, and even webbed feet. </p><p>Several prominent people, including President Teddy Roosevelt, have owned Chessies over the years. And it's even the official dog breed of Maryland. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1878.</p><h2>Chesapeake Bay Retriever Care</h2><p>Be prepared to spend lots of time and energy exercising your Chessie. Likewise, it's important to be consistent with training and socialization. Fortunately, this breed only requires basic grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Chessies don't seem to tire, and they prefer to be busy. They have lots of physical and mental energy to burn. Plan to spend ideally at least two hours per day exercising your dog. Brisk walks, running, hiking, and swimming all are good activities for the Chessie as is a rousing game of fetch for this retrieving dog. Plus, dog sports, such as dock diving, can help to exercise this breed both physically and mentally.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>This is a moderately shedding dog breed. Plan to brush your dog weekly to remove loose fur and prevent mats. You might see an increase in shedding a couple times a year, often in the spring and fall, that will require more frequent brushing to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your Chessie every couple of months or so, depending on how dirty it gets. This breed has a natural musky odor due to its oily coat. Check the nails roughly every month to see whether they need a trim. And look in the ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. Make sure to dry the ears well after your dog goes swimming or otherwise gets wet. Finally, aim to brush your dog's teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Training and socialization, ideally from a young age, are essential to have a well-mannered Chessie. This breed is smart and can learn quickly. But it also can be independent-minded and stubborn. So it's key to be consistent in your training to prevent bad habits from forming. Use only positive training methods for this sensitive breed; harsh corrections can cause it to shut down and not learn.</p><p>Aim to expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various settings from as young of an age as possible. Having positive experiences can help to offset the breed's protective instinct and make it comfortable and confident around strangers. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog.

While they don't usually bark excessively, they will alert you to something they find unusual or threatening.</p><h2>History of the Greater Swiss Mountain Dog</h2><p>The Greater Swiss mountain dog developed in the Swiss Alps. It's theorized that it descended from the breeding of native dogs and mastiff-type dogs that were brought to the area when the Romans invaded Switzerland in 58 B.C. </p><p>As industrialization grew and farmers ceased to rely on working dogs, the Greater Swiss mountain dog breed nearly disappeared. However, in the early 1900s people began to take an interest in them again, and a breed club formed.</p><p>These powerful and hard-working dogs helped out with hauling heavy loads during World War II. And finally they made their way to the United States in the mid-1900s. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1995, and it still remains relatively rare.</p><h2>Greater Swiss Mountain Dog Care</h2><p>Greater Swiss mountain dogs only need a moderate amount of activity to exercise their big bodies.

The dog was specifically bred for this weather-resistant coat, so it could be used for hunting in harsh terrain and water. It also has webbed feet to help it in the water. Overall, German wirehaired pointers have a muscular build with large drop ears and a medium-length beard and eyebrows.

The German wirehaired pointer broke out as a separate breed in the latter part of the 1800s. Its trademark coat was achieved through crosses among the German shorthaired pointer, pudelpointer (a poodle-pointer mix), wirehaired pointing griffon, and other breeds.</p><p>The German wirehaired pointer made its way to North America in the 1920s.

It is essentially a perfect mix of the two breeds, bearing the general appearance of a sphynx atop its shockingly short legs.</p><p>The controversy surrounding this breed stems from the concern that deliberately bred short-limbed cats are vulnerable to health problems and pain due to their anatomical abnormality. In addition, the sphynx breed carries its own set of hereditary issues and is prone to skin damage from the sun. For these reasons, the breed is considered ""experimental"" and is discouraged by the Cat Fanciers' Association.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Affectionate, active and playful but not overly energetic</p><p>Weight: Up to 9 pounds<br/></p><p>Length: Up to 17 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Hairless</p><p>Coat Colors: Black, white, cream, brown, fawn</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, pointed, shaded, bicolor</p><p>Eye Color: Blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 12 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes (somewhat)</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Bambino Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The bambino is affectionate and full of character, enjoying the company of its family and reluctant to be alone for very long. This small to medium-sized cat enjoys playing but doesn't need too much exercise. Because it is hairless, the bambino is more vulnerable to injuries than other cats and should be protected from other pets' bites or scratches as well as excessive sun exposure (even through windows), which might burn the bambino's delicate skin.</p><h2>History of the Bambino Cat</h2><p>The bambino breed was launched in 2005 by Stephanie and Pat Osborne, owners of the Holy Moly Cattery in Arkansas, which is no longer in operation. The Osbornes bred sphynx cats, carrying the recessive hairless gene, with munchkin cats that carried the dominant short-legged gene. They called the new breed bambino (the Italian word for ""baby"").</p><p>The International Cat Association (TICA) recognized the bambino as an ""experimental"" breed in 2006. But, neither the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) nor the American Cat Fanciers' Association (ACFA) will allow the breed's registry because they don't want to encourage the propagation of genetic abnormalities for aesthetic reasons.</p><p>The intentional breeding of genetically disfigured cats like the short-legged bambino and munchkin is a controversial and divisive practice among cat professionals, veterinarians, and the public. Even so, the bambino appears to be gaining popularity as a ""fad"" breed.</p><h2>Bambino Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Some people are attracted to the bambino for its hypoallergenic potential, but no cat is completely hypoallergenic, and the bambino still produces some dander that may irritate sensitive individuals. Surprisingly, the slight ""down"" of the bambino's coat also needs more care than most people think.</p><p>Because they lack a normal absorbent coat, bambinos' skin tends to be oily, making them more susceptible to skin problems like bacterial or fungal infections. Regular bathing and gentle wipes with a moist cloth will help keep their skin and downy coat clean.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Despite their short legs, bambinos are known for being energetic and surprisingly agile. They enjoy playing with toys and having other forms of kitty enrichment around their home. Their shorter legs can tire more easily than ""normal"" cats, so they don't need tons of exercise, but they still like to scratch and climb on low cat trees (jumping from high surfaces is not a good idea and shouldn't be encouraged).<br/></p><p>Bambinos are likely to get sunburned outdoors. If you do take your bambino outside, use a vet-approved feline sunscreen (human sunscreen is toxic to pets) or avoid direct sunlight for more than a few minutes. Cold weather is also dangerous for this hairless cat, and their skin can get injured more easily on brambles or sticks. Overall, bambinos are best suited to an indoor lifestyle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Because the bambino is such a new breed, the extent of its genetic health problems is not yet known. However, it is safe to assume it may be prone to issues that affect both the sphynx and munchkin breeds.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>All cats need to be fed a quality diet, and the bambino will be no exception. They are obligate carnivores, and their food needs to be a high-protein one specifically developed for cats. In addition, it's important to offer measured portions at scheduled meal times (twice per day) so that the bambino does not become overweight, which puts extra pressure on the spine and increases the likelihood of developing feline diabetes.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bambino Cat</h2><p>Bambino cats are still rare, so you may encounter waiting lists or need to travel to buy a kitten. Because of the rarity and increasing popularity of the breed, watch out for unscrupulous ""backyard"" breeders with less-than-ethical practices that seek to take advantage of the market. Kittens from these breeders are more likely to be inbred or carry undocumented health problems.</p><p>Some reputable sphynx breeders also specialize in bambinos, so they are a great resource when looking for a bambino kitten.</p><h2>Bambino Overview</h2><p>Bambinos are known for being very playful and affectionate. They love to be surrounded by company and may become depressed if left alone for more than a few hours. They enjoy homes with gentle children and pets, as they are sociable and friendly, but care must be taken to protect bambinos' delicate skin from injury when playing.</p><p>Their skin requires more care than the average cat because of its tendency toward oiliness. Otherwise, the bambino is a fairly low-maintenance cat that is well-suited to indoor life.<br/></p><p>Playful and affectionate</p><p>Minimal dander (somewhat hypoallergenic)</p><p>Moderate energy level</p><p>Controversial breed due to genetic deformity</p><p>Skin is easily injured</p><p>Downy coat and skin need regular bathing</p>",899

Its head is big and blocky with a relatively short nose and V-shaped ears that hang down. The overall appearance of the boerboel displays power and courage. This mastiff-type dog was bred to be a guardian, and it can even defend property against lions. It's generally very devoted to its family.

It can even be good around kids, but it's often wary of other dogs and strangers. High intelligence, sometimes with a stubborn streak, also helps to shape this dog's personality.<br/></p><h2>History of the Boerboel</h2><p>The powerful boerboel was chiefly developed by Dutch and other European settlers arriving in South Africa during the 1600s to guard their homestead. They brought with them their mastiff-type and bulldog-type breeds, which ultimately interbred with other breeds to give rise to the modern boerboel.</p><p>These dogs could run off lions, leopards, and baboons from their property. They were alert, powerful, and courageous. And they wouldn't back down from a threat. </p><p>Today's boerboel still retains those characteristics. But it also tends to be gentle and friendly with its family. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 2015, and it still remains fairly uncommon in North America. </p><h2>Boerboel Care</h2><p>This large dog breed needs plenty of space to exercise every day. Its grooming needs are fairly straightforward. Plus, early and consistent training and socialization are essential for a well-mannered dog.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least an hour exercising your boerboel every day. Long walks, jogging, hiking, and vigorous playtime all are ideal ways to get some of the dog's energy out. Puzzle toys also can present mental challenges for this intelligent breed.</p><p>Be sure never to let your boerboel off leash unless it's in a securely fenced area outside. This dog might become aggressive around strangers and other dogs. As such, it's often not a good breed to take to a dog park.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The boerboel typically only requires basic grooming. Brush it weekly with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Expect periods of higher shedding often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to increase brushing to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your dog every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. But check whether its ears need cleaning at least weekly. Trim its nails roughly once a month, and aim to brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your boerboel when it's a puppy to instill good behaviors. A full-size boerboel with poor manners can be very difficult to handle. This intelligent breed typically learns quickly and responds well to positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. But it can be stubborn and independent. So it's essential that you are consistent with your commands and don't let bad behaviors slide. </p><p>When boerboel puppies are regularly exposed to different people, other dogs, and various locations, their protective instinct might be able to be somewhat muted. Having lots of positive experiences around strangers is key. But they likely will always have some degree of wariness around strangers.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your boerboel. And feed it a quality canine diet with balanced nutrition, typically via two measured meals per day. Discuss the type of food and the amount with your vet.

Cotons were bred to be friendly companion dogs. They generally form incredibly close bonds with their family and are good with kids, strangers, and other pets. They're adaptable to different living situations, though they don't like being left alone and can develop separation anxiety. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: 9 to 10 inches (female), 10 to 11 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 8 to 13 pounds (female), 9 to 15 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Waxy, long double coat</p><p>Coat Color: White, can have gray or yellow markings</p><p>Life Span: 15 to 19 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, companionable, playful</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Madagascar</p><h2>Characteristics of the Coton de Tulear</h2><p>The Coton de Tulear generally has a very sweet personality. It loves people and even other dogs. It also can have quite a lively and playful temperament but doesn't tend to bark much. </p><h2>History of the Coton de Tulear </h2><p>The Coton de Tulear gets its name from its cotton-like coat and the seaport town of Tulear in Madagascar. The breed's history is unclear, but its ancestors likely arrived in Madagascar in the 16th and 17th centuries. During that time, sailors kept little canine companions, such as the Maltese, and even used them as barter. The small dogs that arrived in Madagascar bred with the native dogs, ultimately creating the Coton de Tulear. </p><p>The people of Madagascar doted on these little white dogs and largely kept the breed isolated to the island. Through selective breeding, they fine-tuned the dogs' health, temperament, and appearance. In fact, today's Cotons rarely have genetic health issues as long as they come from reputable breeders. </p><p>French tourists stumbled upon the breed in the 1960s, and after that it began to spread around Europe. It made its way to North America soon after that. And the American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 2014.</p><h2>Coton de Tulear Care</h2><p>The Coton de Tulear has moderate exercise needs and usually responds well to training. But its grooming requirements are high.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Cotons are medium-energy dogs. But thanks to their small size, roughly an hour of exercise per day should suffice. Morning and evening strolls are ideal, along with games of fetch and other playtime. Plus, this breed tends to enjoy dog sports, including obedience, rally, and agility.</p><p>Puzzle toys are also a great way to exercise a Coton's body and mind. These dogs can get bored easily without enough activity, and they might find destructive ways to entertain themselves. So make sure you can dedicate enough time to exercising your dog.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Because the Coton de Tulear has long, dense hair, its coat should be brushed at least three times per week with a pin brush. Take extra care around the ears, legs, and elbows where the coat is more likely to mat or tangle. If your Coton has very tough mats or tangles, try spritzing them with a conditioning spray and gently remove them with your fingers.<br/><br/>How often your Coton de Tulear needs a bath depends largely on its exposure to dirt and dust and the frequency with which you brush it. In general, more brushing means fewer baths. When you bathe your Coton, pat it dry don't rub to prevent tangling the hair.</p><p>Check your Coton's ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. And check its nails roughly once a month to see whether they need a trim. Also, plan to brush its teeth daily.<br/></p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start obedience training with your Coton from as young of an age as possible to prevent bad habits from forming. These dogs typically respond well to positive training methods and are eager to please. But they might shut down and refuse to learn if harsh corrections are used. </p><p>Likewise, aim to expose your Coton to different people, other dogs, and various locations from an early age to build its comfort and confidence. Most Cotons tend to be charming and curious when meeting new people, and having positive experiences can reinforce this.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Cotons are generally an extremely healthy breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your Coton. And feed a high-quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day.

They are hardy and feisty little dogs that were bred down from the larger standard schnauzer. They can adapt to living in an apartment or roaming around a farm. And they generally are very alert and family-oriented.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Terrier</p><p>HEIGHT: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 11 to 20 pounds<br/></p><p>COAT: Medium-length, wiry double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Black, black and silver, or salt and pepper</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Friendly, lively, alert</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Germany</p><h2>Characteristics of the Miniature Schnauzer</h2><p>Miniature schnauzers typically have a bright and vigilant temperament. They tend to be quite vocal and make for good watchdogs. They also generally have very affectionate personalities and enjoy playtime.</p><h2>History of the Miniature Schnauzer</h2><p>The standard schnauzer can trace its roots back to the 15th century in Germany. They were sturdy working dogs on farms that were used to protect property, assist in herding livestock, exterminate vermin, and more. The giant schnauzer spun off this breed for these tasks as well.</p><p>Then, in the late 19th century, farmers wanted a smaller dog that could hunt vermin. Besides the standard schnauzer, the poodle and affenpinscher also went into creating the mini schnauzer. The combination of these breeds made the mini schnauzer more friendly and eager to please than many other dogs in the terrier group.</p><p>Thus, the miniature schnauzer also quickly caught on as a lovable companion dog. Actor Mary Tyler Moore, politicians Elizabeth and Bob Dole, martial artist/actor Bruce Lee, and other famous figures were mini schnauzer owners. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1926.</p><h2>Miniature Schnauzer Care</h2><p>Miniature schnauzers need a moderate amount of exercise each day, and they should receive training and socialization from a young age. Plus, their coat needs regular grooming.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Miniature schnauzers are no couch potato. These little dogs should get at least an hour of exercise per day in the form of walks, jogging, running freely in a secure area, games of fetch, and more. Puzzle toys also can provide these smart dogs with mental stimulation. And dog sports can challenge them both mentally and physically. </p><p>Make sure always to keep your mini schnauzer on a leash or in a fenced area when exercising outdoors. The breed's strong prey drive can cause it to quickly take off after perceived quarry when given the chance.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The miniature schnauzer has a double coat consisting of a wiry topcoat and soft undercoat. It doesn't shed much, but it must be regularly brushed and trimmed. A quick daily brushing is recommended to remove any loose fur and prevent tangles. Then, most owners opt to take their dog to a groomer every one to two months to have the coat clipped, though you also can learn to do this at home.</p><p>Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Check your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup and abnormalities. And see whether it needs a nail trim about every month as well.

Start from as young of an age as possible to prevent bad habits from forming. The breed generally learns quickly, but due to its high intelligence it can become bored with repetitive training. Thus, it's important to keep training sessions fun, using positive reinforcement methods.</p><p>Aim to expose your dog from a young age to different people, other dogs, and various locations. Mini schnauzers are generally moderately open to meeting strangers and other dogs. But due to their prey drive, they might not be able to coexist peacefully with smaller household pets, such as rodents.</p><p>Furthermore, be aware that this breed has a tendency to be quite vocal at times. So it is important to start working on bark control early to prevent problem barking.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your miniature schnauzer.

The dog has a wedge-shaped head with a long nose, almond-shaped eyes, and upright ears that slightly fold over. Many people recognize this breed thanks to the popularity of Lassie, a rough coat collie. And like Lassie, collies are known for being devoted companions that are quite in tune with their owners.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Herding</p><p>Height: 22 to 24 inches (female), 24 to 26 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 50 to 65 pounds (female), 60 to 75 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Long/rough, short/smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Black, white, and tan; blue merle; blue merle and white; blue merle, white, and tan; sable; sable and white; sable merle; white; sable merle and white; white merle<br/></p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Loyal, affectionate, attentive</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom</p><h2>Characteristics of the Collie</h2><p>Collies tend to have quite a friendly and attentive personality. They have good temperaments for households with children, as long as they have proper training and socialization. Collies are fairly active and playful dogs, and they can be rather vocal.</p><h2>History of the Collie</h2><p>The collie's ancestors can be traced back thousands of years in Scotland. They likely were Roman herding dogs that bred with the local dogs. But the first mention of the collie wasn't until around the year 1800. </p><p>Queen Victoria, whose rule started in 1837, took a liking to these collies during her trips to the royal family's Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And it's largely thanks to her that the breed became popular throughout the United Kingdom in the latter half of the 1800s. </p><p>Collies made their way to North America during that time as well. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1885. The collie's popularity later received a huge boost thanks to the ""Lassie"" TV series that first aired in 1954.<br/></p><h2>Collie Care</h2><p>Collies like an active lifestyle, but they can relax too. How much grooming you'll have to do largely depends on whether you have the smooth or rough coat variety. Also, plan on consistent training and socialization to keep your dog friendly and well-mannered.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Collies should get at least one to two hours of exercise per day via walks, jogs, hikes, vigorous play, and more. Having a fenced yard is ideal to allow them to run freely. They also tend to love dog sports, such as agility and herding, which will help them burn some physical and mental energy. Collies prefer to be active with their humans. When left to their own devices, they might develop problem behaviors, such as excessive barking. But when properly exercised, they're usually calm in the house.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Plan to brush a smooth collie at least weekly to remove loose fur. But rough collies will need brushing at least a few times per week to prevent tangles and mats. Be sure to work slowly and diligently through the whole coat, as mats can often be hiding in the thick fur. Also, expect periods of higher shedding once or twice a year, during which you'll have to brush both varieties more frequently. </p><p>Bathe your collie roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. Check its nails once a month as well to see whether they need a trim. Look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup and abnormalities. And brush its teeth ideally every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Collies are generally smart and eager to please. They tend to do quite well with training and thrive with positive reinforcement; harsh corrections can cause them to shut down. Start both training and socialization from a young age to instill good manners. Besides formal dog training courses, aim to have your collie meet different people and other dogs, and take it to various locations. Positive experiences will help to build its comfort and confidence.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available to your collie. Feed a high-quality canine diet that's nutritionally balanced. It's common to feed two measured meals per day. However, collies are prone to bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twisting, which can be triggered by eating too quickly.

They can be quite vocal, barking at perceived threats. Their personality also is marked by their high intelligence and ability to excel in training. </p><h2>History of the Canaan Dog</h2><p>The ancestors of Canaan dogs came from throughout the Middle East, dating back millennia. In fact, artifacts from as many as 4,000 years ago depict dogs that look quite similar to today's breed. These dogs likely assisted people in herding livestock and guarding property.</p><p>In 70 A.D., the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, and many Israelites fled without their dogs. The Canaan dogs returned to the wild and remained relatively unchanged and undomesticated until the 20th century. Then, people began to domesticate these canines again, often for use as guard dogs as well as companions. </p><p>The re-domesticated Canaan dogs proved to be highly trainable and served in the military and law enforcement. Some also became service dogs. Plus, the breed even became the national dog of Israel. The American Kennel Club first recognized the Canaan dog in 1997, yet it still remains rare around the world. </p><h2>Canaan Dog Care</h2><p>Early and consistent training and socialization are key for a well-adjusted Canaan dog.

Plus, it's ideal to allow your dog to run freely off leash in a secure area, playing fetch and other games.

Also, look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, irritation, and other abnormalities. </p><h3>Training</h3><p>Canaan dogs are smart and generally respond well to positive training techniques, such as clicker training. Start training as young as possible. They are a sensitive breed and will shut down if you try using harsh training methods with them. It's much better (and more effective) to make training fun for a Canaan dog by practicing in short sessions and giving lots of praise and rewards.</p><p>Moreover, Canaan dogs retain many of their wild instincts, one of which is wariness. For this reason, early and regular socialization is of the utmost importance for Canaan dogs, so they don't become overly fearful or shy.</p><p>Expose your dog from as young of an age as possible to different people and various locations. This can help Canaan dogs accept guests you invite into your home. Canaan dogs usually can get along with respectful children when raised with them.

It is a sturdy spitz-type dog that people used for both herding and guarding property, as well as for companionship. </p><p>It's thought that when Vikings raided areas of Britain, they either brought their vallhunds with them or brought early versions of the Welsh corgi back to Sweden, which accounts for the similarities between the modern breeds.

The Beauceron, a French herding breed, is speculated to be part of the catahoula leopard dog's ancestry. </p><p>Early catahoula leopard dogs were valued as exceptional hunting companions. They were also used to herd wild cattle and hogs that were prevalent in Louisiana. People who bred the dogs prioritized their working abilities over appearance.</p><p>The catahoula leopard dog is still a rare breed today. It's recognized by the United Kennel Club (where it is known as the Louisiana catahoula leopard dog). And it's part of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service, which is the first step in the process toward full breed recognition. </p><h2>Catahoula Leopard Dog Care</h2><p>Catahoula leopard dogs need lots of exercise to be happy and healthy. They also require consistent training and socialization from an early age. Fortunately, their grooming needs are fairly straightforward.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Catahoula leopard dogs need both ample exercise and mental stimulation to be content and well-behaved at home. They're prone to becoming destructive if they don't get their energy out in a constructive manner. Aim for at least two hours a day of activity via walks, running, cycling, swimming, hiking, and vigorous playtime. Dog sports, such as agility and rally, also are ideal to challenge a catahoula both mentally and physically. And puzzle toys can keep your dog busy when you need a break.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Grooming is relatively easy for a catahoula. The short coat only requires a weekly brushing to remove loose fur and dirt and to distribute skin oils. Plan on a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. </p><p>Check your catahoula's nails about every month to see whether they need a trim. This breed's nails tend to grow quickly. Check your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup and abnormalities, and make sure to dry them thoroughly after baths and swimming. Also, aim to brush your dog's teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socialization from as young of an age as possible. Catahoulas tend to be independent and territorial, and this can result in bad habits forming if you don't guide your dog. Use positive training methods, and aim to keep training sessions fun. But always be consistent in your commands, so your dog knows it can't get away with bad behavior. </p><p>Moreover, expose your catahoula to different people, other dogs, and various locations from an early age to boost its comfort and confidence. Having positive experiences in different situations can help to quell its territorial nature.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed a high-quality canine diet that is nutritionally balanced. It's typical to give two measured meals per day to avoid overfeeding. But you should always discuss both the amount and type of diet with a vet. Likewise, be mindful of treats and other extra food to prevent excess weight gain. </p><h2>How to Adopt or Buy a Catahoula Leopard Dog</h2><p>While catahoulas are a relatively rare breed, it's still worth checking animal shelters and breed-specific rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $600 to $2,000 on average.</p><h2>Catahoula Leopard Dog Overview</h2><p>Loyal to family</p><p>Good watchdog</p><p>Interesting coat coloring and patterns</p><p>Can be territorial</p><p>Needs lots of exercise and mental stimulation</p><p>Typically not a good choice for city life or apartments</p>",810

Also referred to as the Terv, this breed is known for its love of hard work. It needs daily mental and physical challenges to keep it happy and healthy. Yet it's also a friendly companion that typically bonds closely with its family.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 22 to 24 inches (female), 24 to 26 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 45 to 60 pounds (female), 55 to 75 pounds (male)</p><p>COAT: Medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Fawn and black, mahogany and black</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 14 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, energetic, alert</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: Belgium</p><h2>Characteristics of the Belgian Tervuren</h2><p>The personality of a Belgian Tervuren revolves around its high intelligence and energy. This dog loves to learn new things and face challenges. Moreover, it has a moderately affectionate and friendly temperament overall.</p><h2>History of the Belgian Tervuren</h2><p>Belgian Tervurens stem from four Belgian herding dogs the others are the Groenendael, Malinois, and Laekenois that were once categorized as the same breed. To originate the Terv at the turn of the 20th century, a breeder named M.F. Corbeel crossed long-hair fawn Belgian shepherds, which then had black and other fawn dogs added to their mix. </p><p>Farmers used these dogs both for herding and guarding property. They appreciated them not only for their strength and stamina but also their intelligence and ability to assist in a variety of tasks. </p><p>After many of their farm jobs became mechanized, Tervs found other work in law enforcement, in search and rescue, and as service dogs. The American Kennel Club recognized the breed in 1959.</p><h2>Belgian Tervuren Care</h2><p>Expect to dedicate a lot of time to a Belgian Tervuren. It's ideal that these dogs have an active owner who can provide extensive mental and physical challenges, along with consistent training and socialization. Fortunately, the breed's grooming needs are fairly straightforward. </p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These dogs were bred to be always on the move. And they prefer to exercise with their owners rather than be left to their own devices. Provide them with at least one to two hours of exercise per day in the form of brisk walks, running, hiking, fetch, and other active games. Puzzle toys also can help to challenge them mentally. In addition, dog sports, such as herding and agility, are a great way to provide both mental stimulation and physical activity. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Terv has a moderately shedding thick double coat. Plan to brush at least one to two times per week to remove loose fur, dirt, and tangles. And expect periods of higher shedding typically in the spring and fall as the weather changes, which will require more frequent brushing to keep up with all the loose fur. </p><p>Plan on a bath every month or two, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Check its ears weekly for dirt, debris, and any signs of irritation or infection. Also, check its nails roughly every month to see whether they need a trim. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Consistent training and socialization are a must for a well-behaved Belgian Tervuren. Start as young as possible by enrolling your dog in a puppy obedience class and exposing it in a positive manner to different people, other dogs, and various situations to build its comfort and confidence. Tervs aren't always dog-friendly, but having positive experiences with other dogs from a young age can help.</p><p>Tervs generally respond very well to positive training methods. Making training like a game to challenge them mentally will help to keep their focus. And always be consistent in your commands.

Overall, the dog has a well-balanced build that's a happy medium between slender and muscular. Its head is slightly longer than it is wide, and its drop ears are fairly long with some feathering. The breed's name roughly translates to ""stand by me,"" a nod to how devoted these dogs can be. They were bred to be all-purpose working dogs, as well as gentle and affectionate family companions. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 19 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 40 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat: Medium-length, smooth double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black and white, brown and white, or orange and white with/without ticked, spotted, and/or roan markings</p><p>Life Span: 13 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, companionable, energetic</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Netherlands</p><h2>Characteristics of the Stabyhoun</h2><p>Stabyhouns generally have a friendly and loving temperament with their family.

Dogs that looked similar to the modern breed are depicted in centuries-old Dutch artwork. These dogs were used for hunting, as well as a variety of farm chores. They also were loving companions.</p><p>Until the 20th century, the stabyhoun was often mixed with another Dutch breed, the Wetterhoun. But breeders began to set individual standards for both breeds starting in the mid-1900s. </p><p>In 1994, the first recorded stabyhouns were born in the United States. But the breed still remains rare today, with only several thousand around the world. It's part of the American Kennel Club's Foundation Stock Service, which helps to monitor breeding problems, but it's not yet an officially recognized breed.</p><h2>Stabyhoun Care</h2><p>Plan to spend ample time exercising your stabyhoun every day. Fortunately, grooming is fairly straightforward. And the breed is typically very trainable.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>At least an hour of exercise is essential for a stabyhoun every day. Walks, jogging, hikes, and even swimming are good ways to expend some of the dog's energy. Adequate mental stimulation is just as important for this intelligent breed. A bored stabyhoun might begin to engage in problem behaviors, such as unwanted chewing or digging. Offering puzzle toys can keep your dog happy throughout the day. Dog sports are another great way to exercise your dog both mentally and physically.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The stabyhoun's coat stays relatively clean on its own. Plan to brush weekly to remove loose fur. But expect periods of higher shedding typically twice a year, often in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to brush more frequently. Pay special attention to the areas of the coat with feathering, as they can get tangled more easily. </p><p>Plan on a bath only when your dog gets dirty.

The pointer's shape is instantly recognizable; both its long head and slender tail help do their job of pointing toward game for the hunter. A pointer will stand tall and still with one foot off the ground, tail extended, and nose upturned to point the hunter in the right direction. While they were bred to be dependable hunting dogs, pointers also have become active, affectionate, playful, and sometimes mischievous companions at home. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Sporting</p><p>Height: 23 to 26 inches (female), 25 to 28 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 45 to 65 pounds (female), 55 to 75 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Black, black and white, lemon, lemon and white, liver, liver and white, orange, or orange and white with/without ticked markings, black points, liver points, or self-colored points</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 17 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, even-tempered, energetic</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: England</p><h2>Characteristics of the Pointer</h2><p>Pointers tend to have a loyal and eager-to-please personality. They're generally friendly and adaptable. A high energy level also shapes their temperament, and they prefer an active lifestyle. </p><h2>History of the Pointer</h2><p>The origin of the pointer isn't clear. But a common theory is the breed is a descendant of Spanish pointers that arrived in England during the 1700s. English breeders added other dogs to the mix, including setters, bloodhounds, foxhounds, and greyhounds.</p><p>What resulted was a devoted hunting dog that was swift and agile. Hunters would use pointers in tandem with their hounds. The pointers would locate and then point toward the prey with their bodies, and the hounds would move in to secure the prey. Pointers are said to start showing this hunting instinct as early as 2 months old. </p><p>Pointers were first registered in the U.S. in 1878, and the American Kennel Club officially recognized them upon its founding in 1884. Today, pointers are still used for hunting. They also tend to excel as search-and-rescue dogs, as well as therapy and service dogs. </p><h2>Pointer Care</h2><p>Plan to give your pointer lots of exercise each day. Fortunately, its grooming needs are relatively straightforward, and the breed typically takes well to training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least two hours per day of exercise for a pointer. Long walks, running, cycling, hiking, and play sessions all are ideal ways to burn some energy. Many pointers also enjoy dog sports, such as agility and tracking, which can exercise their minds and bodies. When a pointer doesn't receive sufficient mental stimulation and exercise, it might engage in problem behaviors in the house, such as excessive chewing.</p><p>It's best that a pointer has access to a securely fenced yard where it can run freely to burn energy. Be sure either to keep your dog in a fenced area or on a leash when outside. Otherwise, a pointer's high prey drive might cause it to run off chasing perceived prey.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The pointer doesn't shed or drool excessively. Brush your pointer weekly to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Plan on a bath every month or so, depending on how dirty your dog gets. Look in its ears at least weekly for dirt, wax buildup, and other abnormalities. Also, check your dog's nails roughly every month to see whether they need a trim. Aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training </h3><p>Begin training and socializing your pointer ideally when it's a puppy. A puppy class is a great way for your dog to learn basic commands and manners. Always use positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. Pointers can be sensitive to harsh corrections. Be consistent in your commands. </p><p>Pointers tend to do well with other dogs, especially when socialized from a young age. They even are typically good about meeting strangers. But they might view smaller household pets as prey.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Pointers are overall a very healthy dog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your dog. Feed your pointer a quality canine diet that's nutritionally balanced. Discuss the amount and type of food with your vet. Two measured meals per day are common. But because pointers are prone to bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twisting, which can arise from eating too quickly, you might want to feed smaller, more frequent meals. Food puzzles also can help to slow down their eating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pointer</h2><p>Pointers aren't a highly popular dog breed, but they still can be found for adoption.

They can be quite playful and sometimes even a little mischievous. High intelligence also helps to shape their personality, though they can be stubborn about training at times.</p><h2>History of the Lakeland Terrier</h2><p>The Lakeland terrier can trace its roots back to the 1700s. It's actually one of the United Kingdom's oldest terrier breeds, and its name comes from the Lake District of Northern England. It has also been known as the Fell, Patterdale, Cumberland, and Westmoreland terrier. Farmers in this area used packs of terriers to exterminate vermin on their property, as well as to hunt foxes that threatened their sheep and other livestock. </p><p>The Lakeland's breed standard was honed in the early 1900s. The now-extinct Old English black and tan terrier and the Welsh terrier are thought to be part of its makeup. And the Bedlington terrier, wire fox terrier, border terrier, and Dandie Dinmont also might have contributed to the modern breed.</p><p>The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1934. And the United States Lakeland Terrier Club formed in 1954.<br/></p><h2>Lakeland Terrier Care</h2><p>The Lakeland terrier prefers a fairly active lifestyle. Its coat stays relatively clean, but it does need some specific grooming. And the breed should receive training and socialization from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to give your Lakeland terrier at least an hour of exercise per day. Long walks, jogs, hikes, and vigorous games of fetch all are ideal activities. Dog sports, such as tracking and agility, also can provide some much-needed mental stimulation for this smart breed. </p><p>Always keep your Lakeland terrier on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. The breed's strong prey drive can cause it to take off quickly chasing perceived prey, and it might ignore your recall commands. </p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your Lakeland terrier's coat at least weekly to remove any loose fur and dirt. The coat also should be hand-stripped periodically to remove the dead fur that doesn't shed out on its own. Clipping the coat will change its texture, turning it softer and not as weather-resistant. </p><p>Bathe your dog every four to six weeks, depending on how dirty it gets.

One of their favorite spots will probably be snuggling in your lap.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Non-Sporting</p><p>HEIGHT: 9.5 to 11.5 inches</p><p>WEIGHT: 12 to 18 pounds</p><p>COAT: Long, curly</p><p>COAT COLOR: White, white and apricot, white and buff, white and cream </p><p>LIFE SPAN: 14 to 15 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Affectionate, friendly, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: Yes</p><p>ORIGIN: Spain</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Joyful Bichon Frise</h3><h2>Characteristics of the Bichon Frise</h2><p>Bichons tend to have a very playful and affectionate personality, and they love people. They also have a good temperament for kids and other household pets. They respond fairly well to training and typically don't bark a lot.</p><h2>History of the Bichon Frise</h2><p>The earliest bichons can be traced back to the 13th century in the Canary Islands. Sailors took them aboard their ships and used them in trade, thus making the dog popular around Europe. Aristocrats especially took a shine to these fluffy little canines and treated them as pampered lapdogs.</p><p>Many bichons lost their aristocratic owners during the French Revolution. But luckily street performers picked some up and trained them to perform tricks for money. The breed ended up being a staple at circuses and fairs. </p><p>The bichon struggled again during the World Wars, but people in France and Belgium worked to preserve the breed and set its official standard. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1972.</p><h2>Bichon Frise Care</h2><p>Bichons don't need an excessive amount of activity, but they shouldn't be couch potatoes either. They also require proper training and socialization to be well-mannered dogs. And their grooming is somewhat involved.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Bichons often have bursts of high energy followed by restful spells. They should get at least an hour of exercise per day via activities such as walks and play sessions. It's ideal to have a fenced area where they can run freely, as well. Many bichons also enjoy dog sports to challenge their bodies and minds.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The soft, curly coat of the bichon grows continuously and sheds minimally. Because of this coat type, routine grooming is an absolute necessity. Otherwise, the coat can become matted and tangled. Bichons should be brushed at least two to three times per week. Haircuts are usually necessary every four to six weeks. Make sure to keep the hair around the eyes trimmed to maintain a clear sightline</p><p>Bichons also will need a bath roughly every month, depending on how dirty they get. Their white fur shows dirt easily, and they are prone to developing tear stains around their eyes. Check the nails about every month to see whether they need a trim. And look in your dog's ears weekly for any wax buildup, dirt, and other abnormalities. Finally, aim to brush your bichon's teeth daily to help prevent dental disease.</p><h3>Training</h3><p><br/>The bichon needs proper training and socialization to be happy and well-adjusted. Do not make the mistake of skipping training just because the bichon is a small and generally affable dog. Bad habits can develop when you let training slide. Bichons tend to learn quickly, though housebreaking can take some extra effort. They respond well to positive training methods; harsh corrections can cause them to shut down and not learn.</p><p>Socialize your bichon with different people and in various scenarios to boost its comfort and confidence. Bichons tend to be adaptable dogs who are friendly with strangers, but it's good to reinforce this with positive experiences.</p><p>If you must be away from home for long periods on most days, a bichon might develop separation anxiety and destructive habits. Having another dog for company might help. Crate training can also help curb destructive behavior when you are away from home.</p></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And provide a quality, nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But discuss the quantity and type of diet with your vet to make sure you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Even though these dogs often know how to work their owners for treats, be mindful of extra food to prevent overeating. Even a pound of weight gain is significant for a small dog. </p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bichon Frise</h2><p>Because bichons are quite popular dogs, it's worth checking local animal shelters for one in need of a home. Also, see whether there are any breed-specific rescue groups in your area. For a reputable breeder puppy, expect to pay around $700 to $2,500 on average, though this can vary widely.</p><h2>Bichon Frise Overview</h2><p>Generally very sweet and friendly</p><p>Often good around kids</p><p>Can live in a small space</p><p>Needs more than basic grooming</p><p>Prone to separation anxiety</p><p>Prone to allergies and dental disease</p>",804

Many tend to love kids and even other dogs. They are moderately energetic and enjoy playtime with their humans.</p><h2>History of the American Cocker Spaniel</h2><p>The American cocker spaniel's ancestors hail from England, where spaniels of different body types were routinely classified by weight rather than lineage. The larger, heavier dogs were called field spaniels or springer spaniels, and the smaller dogs were called cocker spaniels.</p><p>Breeders in the United States refined and standardized the American cocker as a distinct breed from its similar English cocker spaniel cousin. The American cocker is smaller and has a shorter muzzle and more profuse coat. The English and Canadian kennel clubs recognized the American and English cockers as separate breeds in 1940. And while the American Kennel Club first recognized the cocker spaniel in 1878, it didn't list the American and English cockers as separate until 1946.</p><p>In the United States, the American cocker spaniel's popularity has ebbed and flowed over the years. It was exceedingly popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. Disney's 1955 animated film even featured an American cocker spaniel as the sweet and gentle Lady.</p><h2>American Cocker Spaniel Care</h2><p>American cocker spaniels require a moderate amount of exercise, as well as early and consistent training and socialization. They also have fairly high grooming needs.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Although American cocker spaniels are moderately energetic, they don't need hours of daily exercise like some other sporting breeds. Their small size is an asset in this department. At least an hour of exercise per day should suffice via walks, games of fetch, and other playtime. Your cocker might also enjoy short jogging sessions, hiking, and really any activity where it can spend time with its favorite humans. To give it both a physical and mental challenge, consider training for a dog sport, such as agility or flyball.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Cockers require a lot of upkeep on their coat if you intend to keep it long. If you're new to the breed, discuss proper grooming with a vet or professional groomer. It's ideal to brush daily with a comb and then a brush to remove loose fur and tangles. Otherwise mats can easily form. You also can opt for a shorter puppy cut, which requires less frequent brushing. </p><p>Baths are often required every one to two weeks, depending on how long the coat is and how dirty your dog gets. Be sure to rinse out shampoo thoroughly to prevent skin irritation, and then dry the coat with a dryer that's warm but not hot.</p><p>Thoroughly dry your dog's ears anytime they get wet to help prevent infection. And check them ideally once or twice a week for any abnormalities. In addition, aim to brush your cocker's teeth every day. And check its nails roughly once a month to see whether they need a trim.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Cockers are usually eager to please and respond well to positive training methods. Avoid harsh corrections, as they can cause this sensitive breed to shut down and not learn. Start with puppy training classes to teach your dog basic obedience and manners. This will help to prevent bad habits from forming. </p><p>Also, aim to socialize your dog from as young of an age as possible to ensure it's well-adjusted. Expose it to different people, other dogs, and various locations.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Your dog should always have access to fresh water.

In fact, the mini American shepherd was bred down from the Aussie and still possesses the athleticism and intelligence of its larger cousins. These small dogs can be quite adventurous and adaptable, and they enjoy an active lifestyle. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>GROUP: Herding</p><p>HEIGHT: 13 to 17 inches (female), 14 to 18 inches (male)</p><p>WEIGHT: 20 to 40 pounds</p><p>COAT: Medium-length double coat</p><p>COAT COLOR: Blue, blue merle, red, or red merle with/without white markings and/or tan points</p><p>LIFE SPAN: 12 to 13 years</p><p>TEMPERAMENT: Intelligent, active, playful</p><p>HYPOALLERGENIC: No</p><p>ORIGIN: United States</p><h2>Characteristics of the Miniature Australian Shepherd</h2><p>The miniature American shepherd generally has a lively and loyal temperament. It is a friendly, playful breed that loves people and even other dogs. Its temperament also is marked by its high intelligence and ability to learn various tricks.</p><h2>History of the Miniature American Shepherd</h2><p>The creation of the miniature American shepherd is closely tied to that of its larger cousin, the Australian shepherd. Both breeds emerged in California in the 1960s. The predecessor of both breeds was a type of herding dog from the Pyrenees Mountains that came to the U.S. by way of Australia. California ranchers admired the dogs and referred to them as Australian shepherds, or Aussies.</p><p>Some people began purposely breeding smaller Aussies, and they became popular on the rodeo circuit. They had the stamina and herding skills of their larger counterparts but were more portable and suitable for indoor living.</p><p>By the mid-1970s, there was a consistent version of mini Aussie, as the dogs were called at the time. The name later was changed as people pursued a separate breed recognition. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 2015.</p><h2>Miniature American Shepherd Care</h2><p>The miniature American shepherd needs a lot of exercise every day. It also requires proper training and socialization, in which it typically excels. And its grooming needs are fairly straightforward.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>These are smart, athletic dogs that need mental and physical challenges to keep them happy and healthy. Otherwise, they might develop problem behaviors, such as excessive barking and unwanted chewing. Plan on at least one to two hours of exercise per day via walks, jogging, hikes, and playtime. They prefer to be active with their humans rather than being left to their own devices.</p><p>In addition, dog sports, such as agility, are a great way to exercise them both physically and mentally. And puzzle toys can provide mental stimulation as well.<br/></p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The miniature American shepherd's coat is fairly wash-and-wear. It needs no trimming or shaving. Brush it at least weekly to remove loose fur and prevent tangles. A couple times a year, often in the spring and fall, shedding will increase. During that time, brush at least a few times per week to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your dog roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. And check its nails to see whether they need trimming on a monthly basis. Also, be sure to look in its ears at least weekly for wax buildup, debris, and irritation. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>These dogs are typically quite smart and eager to please, thus making them highly trainable. Start from as young of an age as possible with basic obedience to prevent bad habits from forming. And always use positive training methods. </p><p>In addition, start socializing your dog when it's a puppy with different people, other dogs, and in various locations. This will build its comfort and confidence, helping it grow into a well-mannered and adaptable companion.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Mini American shepherds are mostly a healthy dog breed.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water available for your dog. And feed a nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's common to feed two measured meals per day, but you should discuss both the type of food and quantity with your vet. If your dog leads a very active lifestyle, it might need more calories. But you should always watch treats and other extra food, as even a pound of weight gain can be a lot for a small dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Miniature American Shepherd</h2><p>The miniature American shepherd isn't a very common breed, but it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue organizations for a dog in need of a home.

The dog has a moderately long head with bushy eyebrows and drop ears. And overall, this scenthound is slightly longer than it is tall, which helps to give it a smooth stride and good endurance. The Griffon Nivernais is an athletic breed that loves being outdoors and would do best with an active household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 20.5 to 23.5 inches (female), 21.5 to 24.5 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 45 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Long, rough</p><p>Coat Color: Wolf gray, blue gray, or gray grizzle with/without tan, white, and black markings</p><p>Life Span: 10 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Independent, fearless, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: France</p><h2>Characteristics of the Griffon Nivernais</h2><p>The Griffon Nivernais tends to have an affectionate temperament with its family, but it can be somewhat reserved around strangers. A stubborn streak also can be part of this dog's personality, complicating training at times. Plus, the breed is known for its vocal nature, though that can vary by individual dog.</p><h2>History of the Griffon Nivernais</h2><p>The Griffon Nivernais can trace its ancestors back to the 1200s in France. These scenthounds were used for hunting, particularly wild boar and wolves, and protecting property. However, by the 1800s the breed had virtually disappeared, especially as faster hounds had been developed. </p><p>Then, in the early 1900s, Griffon Nivernais enthusiasts attempted to reconstruct the breed. They mixed some of the last remaining breed representatives with other dogs, including the otterhound, Griffon Vendéen, and French foxhound. This modern Griffon Nivernais is smaller than its ancestors, but it still closely resembles those ancient dogs.</p><p>The breed is still very rare today, especially outside of France. The American Kennel Club does not officially recognize it. But the United Kennel Club lists it as part of its Scenthound Group.<br/></p><h2>Griffon Nivernais Care</h2><p>The Griffon Nivernais needs a good amount of daily exercise. Its coat stays fairly clean but does have some specialized grooming needs. And it should receive training and socialization ideally from a young age.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan to spend at least one to two hours per day exercising your Griffon Nivernais. Long walks, jogging, cycling, and hiking all are ideal activities to burn some of this breed's energy. Plus, dog sports, such as tracking, can provide mental challenges. </p><p>Always keep your Griffon Nivernais on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outdoors. This breed has a high prey drive. And it might ignore recall commands in favor of chasing a small animal or other perceived prey.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Griffon Nivernais's coat should be brushed weekly to remove loose fur. The coat naturally repels dirt and isn't prone to tangling or matting. But it should be hand-stripped a couple times per year to remove dead fur. </p><p>Because the coat stays relatively clean on its own, a bath will likely only be necessary when the dog gets dirty generally every one to two months. But make sure to check your dog's ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Also, plan to trim its nails every month or so. And brush its teeth every day.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your Griffon Nivernais when it's a puppy to instill good manners and prevent bad habits from forming. The breed is known for having a stubborn and independent streak. But it typically takes well to positive-reinforcement training methods. Avoid harsh corrections, which can cause your dog to shut down and refuse to learn. And be consistent in your commands; don't let bad behaviors slide.</p><p>Aim to expose your dog to different people and other dogs from an early age to boost its comfort and confidence. The breed often gets along well with other dogs, as long as it's had proper socialization. And while it can be reserved around strangers, having positive experiences around a variety of people can help to make it more open and friendly.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Griffon Nivernais is generally a healthy dog breed with no known hereditary health issues. That said, it still can develop age-related health issues that affect many dogs, such as arthritis.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your dog. And feed it a high-quality canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day to ensure proper nutrition. But you should always discuss both the type of food and the amount with your vet. Age, activity level, and other factors can influence a dog's dietary needs. In addition, be mindful of treats and other extra food to avoid overfeeding your dog.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Griffon Nivernais</h2><p>Depending on where you live, it can be extremely difficult to locate a Griffon Nivernais at a rescue organization or reputable breeder.

Puppies actually are usually born with a dark coat, which grows out to the wheaten color as the dog matures. The coat doesn't shed much and instead continuously grows and must be trimmed. Overall, the wheaten has a square, muscular build. It was bred to be a hard-working farm dog as well as a cuddly companion.</p><h3>Breed Characteristics</h3><p>Group: Terrier</p><p>Height: 17 to 18 inches (female), 18 to 19 inches (male)</p><p>Weight: 30 to 35 pounds (female), 35 to 40 pounds (male)</p><p>Coat: Wavy, silky, medium-length</p><p>Coat Color: Wheaten</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 14 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, lively, affectionate</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Ireland</p><h2>Characteristics of the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier</h2><p>Soft-coated wheaten terriers tend to have an upbeat, extroverted temperament. They are typically loving with and devoted to their owners, and they are moderately wary when it comes to strangers. A bubbly, high energy level also shapes the wheaten's personality.</p><h2>History of the Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier</h2><p>The soft-coated wheaten terrier originated in Ireland roughly 200 years ago. It comes from the same ancestor as the Kerry blue and Irish terriers. And all three terriers were bred to be all-purpose farm dogs. </p><p>They could herd livestock, protect property, and even exterminate rodents. Plus, they were lovable companions to their families. Today's wheatens still have that prey drive, as well as a protective streak when it comes to their family and property. </p><p>The Irish Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1937. And wheatens made their way to the United States in the 1940s. The American Kennel Club didn't recognize the breed until 1973.</p><h2>Soft-Coated Wheaten Terrier Care</h2><p>Soft-coated wheaten terriers need plenty of exercise each day, and they tend to remain energetic well into their old age. Their coat does require quite a bit of upkeep. And they need early and consistent training and socialization.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Plan on at least one to two hours of exercise per day for a wheaten. These dogs prefer to be active with their owners rather than being left to their own devices. Walks, jogging, hikes, and games of fetch all are ideal activities. Plus, dog sports, such as agility and herding, are a great way to burn both mental and physical energy. </p><p>When outdoors, keep wheatens either on a leash or in a securely fenced area. Both their herding instinct and their prey drive can make them want to chase moving objects, including cars and small animals. And they might ignore your attempts to call them back.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The wheaten's coat requires daily brushing, as it tends to mat easily. Use a pin or slicker brush to remove any loose hair and dirt. And follow that with a comb to make sure to get out all the tangles. </p><p>Plan on a bath at least every month, depending on how dirty your dog gets. And trim the coat roughly every four to six weeks, paying special attention to the hair around the eyes and the beard to keep them neat. Check your dog's nails every month to see whether they're due for a trim. And try to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Wheatens are smart, but they also can be stubborn and strong-willed. Aim to start training and socialization when your dog is a puppy to prevent bad habits from forming. Always use positive-reinforcement methods, and try to make training sessions fun. Be consistent and firm in your commands. But avoid harsh corrections, as they can cause this sensitive breed to shut down and refuse to learn.</p><p>Moreover, having positive experiences with new people and dogs from an early age can help to make the wheaten more comfortable around strangers.

You're in luck the Tonkinese cat is the best of both worlds. Smart, sweet, and sociable, the Tonkinese is a hybrid (mix) of the Siamese and the Burmese. This beautiful, pointed cat has soft, muted colors with a lean yet sturdy build. Complementing its charming personality is a chirp-like voice. While this cat likes to ""talk,"" it doesn't share the loud, demanding meow of its notably vocal relative.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Tonk</p><p>Personality: Friendly, sociable, playful, intelligent</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 28 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Platinum, champagne, blue, and natural</p><p>Coat Patterns: Colorpoint, solid, and mink</p><p>Eye Color: Blue, gold, or green</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 16 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United States</p><h2>Tonkinese Cat Characteristics </h2><p>Active and intelligent, the Tonkinese loves to play, but its easygoing temperament makes it content to spend time with its family without a lot of attention or stimulation. It is happy to ""speak"" when spoken to but doesn't vocalize excessively. The Tonk has an irrepressible people-loving personality. It is eager to be pet, held, talked to, played with, and cuddled on a warm lap. Families with young children who need a tolerant, playful cat may find the Tonkinese to be the perfect pet.</p><h2>History of the Tonkinese Cat</h2><p>The Tonkinese breed came to be because Siamese and Burmese enthusiasts wanted a cat that looked a lot like a Siamese but with a sturdier build and mellower temperament.</p><p>Though it was not yet an established breed, the Tonkinese arrived in the US in 1930 in the form of a female cat named Wong Mau. Imported from Burma by retired Navy doctor Joseph Thompson, Wong Mau was originally considered a poor-quality Siamese by US breeders. She is now credited as the ""mother"" of the Burmese breed the Tonkinese breed because genetic testing has since determined that Wong Mau was, in fact, a Burmese-Siamese cross.</p><p>It wasn't until the 1960s that the Tonkinese breed was firmly established by Jane Barletta, a Siamese breeder in New Jersey, who was determined to develop a ""moderate"" Siamese. While several other breeders sought to create a similar breed that balanced the Siamese with the qualities of the Burmese, it was Barletta who worked most diligently in establishing the Tonkinese.</p><p>She advertised this ""beautifully balanced"" breed in magazine, spoke about it on national television, and initiated a nationwide network of breeders that eventually culminated in the formation of the Tonkinese Breed Club.</p><p>Due, in large part, to Barletta's efforts, The Tonkinese breed was accepted by the Cat Fanciers' Association in 1979.</p><h2>Tonkinese Cat Care</h2><p>The Tonkinese is a breeze to care for. With a short coat that requires minimal upkeep, grooming is a rare necessity. Regular play is all they need as far as exercise goes, and occasional puzzle toys are appreciated by this curious cat. </p><p>If you don't have other pets in the home, consider a second kitty the Tonkinese loves to have a playmate and companion when their human is away. If you do have other pets in the home, you can look forward to the Tonkinese making animal buddies right away. <br/></p><p>While its grooming needs are minimal, the Tonkinese is prone to gingivitis, so begin tooth brushing early in life to establish it as a routine.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Regular vet visits and a proper diet are essential to maintaining the health of any cat, so make sure your Tonkinese gets annual exams and stays up to date on vaccinations.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The short and stocky Burmese contributes a bulkier build to the Tonkinese, but the lanky Siamese gives it some height and agility. The coat is short and sleek (though there is a longer-haired version that is generally referred to as a Tibetan). The head shape is also a balance of the two parent breeds, neither too blocky nor dramatically wedge-shaped.</p><p>The color points of the Tonkinese are more muted than a Siamese, creating a softer look, but the eyes are ideally blue (they can be gold or green like the Burmese).</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like many cats today, the Tonkinese is at risk for obesity and should be fed an appropriately balanced diet in moderation.

They are also often vocal and rather demanding. The breed arose as a result of a spontaneous genetic mutation in pure breed Siamese that caused the cats to develop a longer coat type.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Weight: 6 to 11 pounds</p><p>Length: About a foot and a half long</p><p>Coat: Long</p><p>Coat Color: Creamy white body with a variety of possible color points on the face, ears, legs, and tails</p><p>Eye Color: Deep, vivid blue</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 20 years</p><h2>Characteristics of the Balinese</h2><h2>History of the Balinese</h2><p>The Balinese does not have any links with Indonesia (their Siamese relatives are actually originally from Thailand), the name was created as the breeders thought the cat's grace and elegance mirrored that of the dancers in the Temples of Bali.</p><p>The breed doesn't have a long history. They were first introduced in the 1940s in America after long-haired Siamese kittens appeared in a litter. This spontaneous mutation caused the breeders to strive towards nurturing more of this variety, and the first Balinese breeding program was introduced in the 1950s.</p><p>While some people may simply view the Balinese as a long-haired variety of the Siamese Cat, this caused uproar amongst the purists and is one of the reasons they are no longer referred to as 'Long-haired Siamese' within breeding circles.</p><p>The Cat Fanciers' Federation gave the Balinese official championship status in 1961.</p><h2>Balinese Care</h2><p>The Balinese is generally a very active, intelligent, affectionate and particularly social, medium-sized cat. They enjoy playing and are very curious, so it is important that you have lots of toys, scratching posts and enrichment ideas ready to keep them entertained and stimulated.</p><p>Their clever personalities mean that they can be trained more easily than many other breeds using positive reinforcement methods. While they are smart and very graceful, they are still sometimes referred to as clowns because of their goofy and fun antics.</p><p>They also crave company. They are not a cat that would suit being left alone for long periods at a time, and this could result in them becoming distressed and possibly exhibiting destructive behavior. With proper introductions, they are a breed that can live well alongside children, dogs, and other pets. They are often a popular choice as a family cat.</p><p>Like many cats, they do like to find high vantage points, so make sure that you keep surfaces clear and provide them with suitable ""hiding"" spots to allow them peace should they desire it. This could save your curtains from being ruined and your fragile items from being shattered.</p><p>If you enjoy a tranquil home, the Balinese may not be the cat for you; they are known for being particularly vocal and do like to chat with their owners, often demanding attention. They are generally accepted as being slightly quieter than a normal Siamese though.</p><p>The Balinese has a medium length, silky coat, and while they do shed seasonally, their coat does not require too much maintenance. They don't have an undercoat and this means they are not so prone to getting tangles or mats. A good brush out of any loose, dead hair around once a week should be enough to keep their coat in good condition.</p><p>The breed comes in a variety of different colors. The main body of the coat is usually a creamy white, but they have distinctive color points that are found on the face, ears, full tail and legs. The most common of these are seal, chocolate, blue and lilac, and these are the four that are recognized as acceptable official breed standards. They can also come in red, lynx and tortoiseshell color points.</p><p>With their bright blue eyes, large ears, impressive plumed tail, and muscular physique, they are a strikingly beautiful and athletic creature. Their large ears may need a little more attention paid to cleaning than some cats though.</p><p>Some Balinese lovers claim that they are a hypoallergenic breed. There is no scientific basis behind this though. The fact that the Balinese does not have an undercoat means that they shed less and this could minimize a potential allergic reaction, but it is certainly no guarantee.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While they are generally a healthy breed, the Balinese can develop some of the same hereditary conditions as the Siamese. A good breeder will do rigorous health checks to minimize any problems developing.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Balinese, like any cat, should be fed a high-quality diet that is appropriately portion-controlled to avoid any weight-related health problems. They are known for being picky eaters so you may find they are more inclined to eat a wet diet than dry kibble. If they are on a wet diet, they may need a more regular dental hygiene regime to prevent them from developing gum disease.</p><p>Balinese are friendly, playful, family pets who thrive on company</p><p>Their beautiful coats do not require a lot of maintenance</p><p>They are very clever and are more trainable than many breeds</p><p>They can be very vocal, and their constant chatter can grind on some peoples nerves</p><p>They are not suited to being left for long periods on their own</p><p>Their intelligence and activity levels mean they need a lot of stimulation and engagement to avoid them resorting to destructive behavior</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Balinese Cat</h2>",877

Despite its small size, the Singapura is energetic and athletic. There is some controversy on the origins of the Singapura, but consensus is that the breed occurred naturally in Singapore, where it was collected and brought it back to the US to start a breeding program in the 1970s. Once a common street cat in Singapore, these purebred felines are now rare, prized pets. Singapuras are loving, loyal pets that make for years and years of close companionship.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Kucinta, Pura</p><p>Personality: Energetic, intelligent, social</p><p>Weight: Four to eight pounds</p><p>Length: Nine to twelve inches </p><p>Coat Length: Short </p><p>Coat Colors: Sepia agouti </p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby</p><p>Eye Color: Green, hazel, or yellow</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Singapore</p><p>Lifespan: 11 to 15 years</p><h2>Characteristics of the Singapura</h2><p>The Singapura has a very social personality. loves to be involved in your daily activities, and is happiest when they are with family. Singapuras thrive on company, both human and animal including dogs when introduced at an early age. As a result, they do not do well when left alone for long periods. Singapuras usually stop growing at around two years of age.<br/></p><h2>History of the Singapura</h2><p>The history of the Singapura is somewhat controversial. The widely accepted narrative is that the Singapura originated naturally on the streets of Singapore, where two American breeders, Tommy and Hal Meadow, spotted the cats and flew them back to the US in 1975. They then began a breeding program with three Singaporian brown ticked cats in the late 1970s. However, in 1987, another American breeder, Jerry Mayes, came across importation papers that suggested that the original three cats had been flown from the US to Singapore in 1974. The Meadows brothers were accused of passing off an Abyssinian/Burmese mix as a novel breed. A CFA investigation found no wrongdoing on behalf of the Meadows, but there is still doubt as to whether or not the Singapura is a natural breed, and the overall truth of the Meadows' story.</p><p>After the CFA completed its investigation, Singapore adopted the Singapura as a tourism mascot for the city. The Singapura was accepted by TICA in 1979, by CFA in 1982, and was granted championship status in 1988.</p><h2>Singapura Care</h2><p>Caring for a Singapura cat is relatively straightforward. As always, understanding how best to care for your cat improves its quality of life.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>The Singapura is a naturally curious and athletic cat, so mental and physical stimulation is important for its health and wellbeing. The exercise needs for the Singapura are standard to those of most domestic cats. Light, daily exercise using toys, jumping posts, or fetch should be enough to satisfy the breed's needs. The Singapura is intelligent and can be trained to do tricks.</p><h3>Shedding</h3><p>Although not considered hypoallergenic, the Singapura is a light shedder. It has a short coat and fine hair, making it a good option for a dander-sensitive owner.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The Singapura requires minimal grooming. Weekly brushing, ear-debris checking, and occasional nail-trimming will be enough to meet your cat's grooming needs. Periodic tooth-brushing is also a good idea.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Every cat owner should be on the lookout for common health issues, no matter the breed, and the Singapura is no exception. The Singapura has a few predispositions that are important to be aware of.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Singapura is among the littlest domestic cats. Despite its miniature size, its frame is muscular and athletic, with strong legs and a stocky neck. The Singapura has a rounded head, pointed ears, large angular green, hazel, or gold eyes, and a relatively short tail. It has ticked tabby markings and a short, glossy, sepia coat. The Singapura is not hypoallergenic, but its short coat creates only minimal shedding.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>To ensure a long and healthy life for your Singapura, feed it high-quality cat food, suitable for the cat's small size and high energy level. You may opt for a raw food diet, in which case, consult your vet to ensure it includes all necessary nutrients. Singapuras are grazers, meaning they like to return to their food throughout the day and not eat it all at once.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Singapura</h2><p>The Singapura is an uncommon breed, which may make it challenging to find these cats in local shelters, or even shelters specializing in purebreds. However, it's always good practice to check with local rescue organizations before you contact a breeder. Buying a Singapura from a breeder typically costs between $800 and $2000, and competition-eligible Singapura cats can cost over $3000.</p><h2>Breed Overview</h2><p>The Singapura makes for a great addition to any family. Its high activity level and playful nature are best suited for owners able to give the cat ample attention. The Singapura's love for jumping and climbing may cause some frustration, but your cat's naughty desires will likely be satisfied with adequate play and stimulation.</p><p>Extremely affectionate and social</p><p>Enjoys playtime and learning new tricks</p><p>Short coat is easy to groom</p><p>Requires plenty of mental and physical exercise</p><p>May suffer from separation anxiety without human or animal companions</p><p><br/></p><p>Mischievous tendencies</p>",851

The breed is larger than a beagle but smaller than a foxhound. It's a well-balanced and muscular dog, bred for good endurance. And it has an excellent nose for catching scents while on the hunt. Overall, the harrier is a cheerful and energetic dog that's best for an active household.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 19 to 21 inches</p><p>Weight: 45 to 60 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short double coat</p><p>Coat Color: Black, white, and tan; lemon and white, or red and white</p><p>Life Span: 12 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Friendly, energetic, sociable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom</p><h2>Characteristics of the Harrier</h2><p>The harrier generally has a very upbeat and outgoing personality. It loves people and even other dogs, though it might view smaller household pets as prey. High energy and a tendency to bark also help to shape this dog's temperament.</p><h2>History of the Harrier</h2><p>The harrier's origin story is murky. It's believed that dogs resembling harriers appeared in England during the 1200s and were used for hunting hares (hence the breed's name) and other quarry in packs. This is why today's harrier typically still gets along well with other dogs.<br/></p><p>Some think bloodhounds, basset hounds, and other hound breeds played a role in the harrier's development. Another theory is that the modern harrier is simply a smaller version of the English foxhound.<br/></p><p>Harriers arrived in the United States during Colonial times and were favored among hunters. They also potentially contributed some genetics to American hound breeds. The American Kennel Club first recognized the harrier in 1885, and today it is rare to find in North America.</p><h2>Harrier Care</h2><p>Plan to provide your harrier with lots of daily exercise. Fortunately, the breed's grooming needs are minimal. And it typically takes well to training, though it can be stubborn at times.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Harriers have a high energy level, as they were bred to run for hours on hunts. At least two hours of exercise per day is ideal to make sure your dog is calm and well-behaved when it's in the house. A bored harrier might become destructive and engage in behaviors, such as unwanted chewing or excessive barking. Long walks, jogging, cycling, and hiking all are great ways to get some of their energy out. Dog sports, such as tracking and agility, also can help to challenge their minds along with their bodies. </p><p>Always keep your harrier on a leash or in a securely fenced area when outside. These hunting dogs will quickly take off following a scent and often will ignore a recall command.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your harrier's short coat weekly with a soft-bristle brush or grooming mitt to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Plan on periods of higher shedding often when the weather changes in the spring and fall, during which you'll have to brush more frequently. </p><p>Bathe your dog every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. But check its ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Trim your dog's nails roughly once a month or as needed. And aim to brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Start training and socializing your harrier when it's a puppy to instill good manners and prevent bad habits from forming. These dogs typically respond well to positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. It's also important to be consistent in your commands, as harriers can be stubborn at times. Don't let bad behaviors slide. </p><p>A puppy class can teach your dog basic obedience and social skills. Also, aim to expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations to ensure proper socialization. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always provide fresh water for your harrier. And feed a nutritionally balanced canine diet typically via two measured meals per day. Be sure to discuss both the type of food and the amount with your vet to verify that you're meeting your dog's individual needs. Dietary needs can change with age, activity level, and other factors. Plus, be mindful of treats and other extra food to prevent overeating.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Harrier</h2><p>Harriers are not a common dog breed in North America. But it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. Put your name on a breed wait list if possible. Likewise, you might have to travel far and wait some time for a puppy from a reputable breeder, depending on where you live.

However, they can be wary of strangers. And while they don't have an extremely energetic temperament, they still prefer lots of daily activity to thrive.</p><h2>History of the American Water Spaniel</h2><p>European settlers in the Great Lakes region of the United States wanted a gun dog that could navigate the cold waters of the large lakes. The exact origin of the American water spaniel breed is unclear. But it's likely that the Irish water spaniel, curly-coated retriever, and (now-extinct) English water spaniel played a role in its development. </p><p>The resulting dog not only was skilled at retrieving in the water, but it also could hunt small game on land. However, as hunting transitioned from a means for survival to a sporting endeavor for many people, the breed's numbers dropped. </p><p>In the early 1900s, breeders worked to keep the American water spaniel alive. The American Kennel Club first recognized the breed in 1940, and it became the state dog of Wisconsin in 1985. Today, it is still a rare dog breed.<br/></p><h2>American Water Spaniel Care</h2><p>The American water spaniel prefers an active, outdoorsy lifestyle. Its coat is fairly easy to care for. And it is known to be a highly trainable breed.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least an hour per day of exercise for your American water spaniel. Walks, jogging, hiking, and swimming all are ideal activities, along with energetic play sessions. Plus, dog sports, such as dock diving and agility, can challenge your dog's body and mind. </p><p>When an American water spaniel doesn't get enough physical activity and mental stimulation, it can become destructive and/or bark excessively. Puzzle toys can help to keep your dog occupied, but you'll also have to make time to exercise it daily.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog weekly to remove any loose fur. A slicker brush can help to remove the dead fur from the breed's dense undercoat. Expect more shedding as the weather gets warmer and the undercoat thins, at which time you'll likely have to brush a little more frequently. But overall the breed sheds minimally. </p><p>Bathe your dog roughly once a month, depending on how dirty it gets. Be sure to dry its ears well after baths and swimming, and check the ears at least weekly to see whether they need cleaning. Also, trim your dog's nails every month or so, and brush its teeth daily.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socialization ideally when your American water spaniel is a puppy. This breed takes quite well to positive-reinforcement training methods, such as treats and praise. In addition to obedience commands, aim to expose your dog to different people, other dogs, and various locations from a young age.

Part of the Siamese family of cat breeds (which also includes the Balinese and oriental longhair), this beautiful ""rainbow cat"" is intelligent, athletic, and vocal it is not shy about demanding attention. The oriental shorthair craves affectionate interaction with its family, both the human members and other pets.<br/></p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Other Names: Rainbow cat, Ornamental</p><p>Personality: Affectionate, playful, sociable, and vocal</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair</p><p>Coat Colors: White, black, gray, brown, orange (300 variations)</p><p>Coat Patterns: Solid, shaded, smoke, and tabby</p><p>Eye Color: Green, blue, gold, yellow; odd-eyes are possible</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes (somewhat)</p><p>Origin: England</p><h3>Hypoallergenic?</h3><p>The oriental shorthair is often considered a ""hypoallergenic"" cat. While no breed of cat is truly hypoallergenic, this breed generally produces less of the Fel d 1 protein that is responsible for triggering allergies in humans.</p><h2>Oriental Shorthair Characteristics</h2><p>Considered an excellent pet, the oriental shorthair is outgoing and fun. This cat is gregarious by nature and, unlike many other breeds, can become withdrawn and depressed when left alone for more than a few hours at a time.</p><p>Most orientals enjoy meeting new people. Occasionally, a cat may become fixated on one person and be more evasive with other people, but this is more of an exception than the rule.</p><p>It should be noted that vocalization is a key part of the oriental shorthair's personality, a trait shared among most cats of the Siamese family. An oriental will express excitement, interest, despair, or other emotions with a wide range of vocal sounds. Many oriental owners report that their cats carry on ""conversations"" with various meows and chirps.</p><h2>History of the Oriental Shorthair</h2><p>The oriental shorthair resulted from the crossbreeding of several other cat breeds. In the wake of World War II, many domestic cat breeds were in jeopardy. To revive the Siamese, English breeders introduced Russian blues, Abyssinians, and British shorthairs into their lines.</p><p>At first, each non-pointed hybrid received a unique breed distinction, but breeders soon realized that the gene pool of these cats harbored a vast array of color combinations. To simplify classification, all non-pointed kittens became known as orientals.</p><p>The oriental was introduced to the United States in the 1970s and quickly gained championship status from the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) in 1977. Initially, the breed was only a short-haired variety, but further crossbreeding in the US led to both the oriental shorthair and oriental longhair breed varieties. The oriental longhair received championship status from the CFA in 1995.</p><p>Crossbreeding in the United States further expanded the breed's coat color combinations, leading to the approximate 300 varieties of colors and patterns existing today. The oriental is sometimes called the ""rainbow cat"" for its colorful coat.</p><h2>Oriental Shorthair Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>The oriental's short, silky coat is low-maintenance, and this cat does an excellent job of self-grooming. However, your cat might appreciate an occasional brushing to remove any loose hair and stimulate the skin. </p><p>Regular ear-checks, dental cleanings, and nail trims are also important parts of keeping any cat well-groomed.<br/></p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Oriental shorthairs thrive on interactive stimulation and enjoy learning skills such as walking on a harness, performing tricks, and playing fetch. These cats are considered to be very interactive and enjoy playing with human family members or other cats or even dogs. It's often recommended that you make sure your oriental has a furry companion.</p><p>Orientals love leaping and climbing to high vantage points like refrigerators or cabinets to keep an eye on activities down below. You can encourage safe (and potentially less destructive) climbing by providing a tall cat tree with lots of levels for active play.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>With a genetic history closely intertwined with the Siamese, oriental shorthairs are predisposed to the same health problems as their pointed relatives. In general, however, the breed is considered healthy.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>A smooth, silky coat that lies close to the body accents the breed's angular face, wide-set ears, and long legs. The oriental shorthair is a medium-sized cat with a long, lean build and somewhat exaggerated features (ears, nose, and eyes).</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Keeping your oriental shorthair healthy requires feeding high-quality cat food. Feed the appropriate amount of food at scheduled times to avoid excessive snacking and weight gain.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Oriental Shorthair</h2><p>The oriental shorthair gained rapid popularity after being imported to the United States, and today the breed enjoys a healthy fan base. Because of this popularity, there are many oriental shorthair breeders. In addition, regional and national groups help re-home displaced oriental shorthair cats.</p><h2>Oriental Shorthair Overview</h2><p>The oriental shorthair looks svelte and elegant while retaining a playful personality. It loves being with humans cuddling, walking, playing, and ""talking"" with its distinctive voice. The only trouble with owning an oriental is the fact that this cat requires attention. Almost dog-like in its personality, the oriental loves being involved in its owner's daily life and will almost certainly become depressed if ignored or left alone for too long.</p><p>Outgoing and friendly</p><p>Beautiful coat colors</p><p>Generally healthy</p><p>Tends to vocalize a lot</p><p>Climbs to high places</p><p>Needs almost constant companionship</p>",848

A Peterbald is naturally outgoing and friendly, and it wants to be involved in any activities that might be happening around the house. When everyone settles down, this kitty is happy to nestle onto a lap for quiet cuddles.</p><h2>History of the Peterbald Cat</h2><p>A newer cat breed, the Peterbald was first developed in 1994 when a Russian breeder named Olga S. Mironova crossed an Oriental shorthair cat with a Don Sphynx cat. The resulting breed is now called the Peterbald after its popularity among cat enthusiasts of St. Petersburg, Russia.</p><p>The Peterbald breed was accepted by The International Cat Association (TICA) in 1997 and was recognized for championship status in 2005. TICA accepted the breed's brush coat variety for championship status in May 2008; one of the first brush coat Peterbald cats to achieve championship status was named Blue Belle.</p><p>Today, though relatively rare, the breed is recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association (CFA).</p><h2>Peterbald Cat Care</h2><p>The Peterbald cat is generally considered to be a low-maintenance breed. Potential Peterbald owners won't need to worry much about shedding, but the hairless varieties benefit from an occasional bath or wipe-down so that skin oils don't build up and cause irritation. These cats should be kept indoors because their lack of hair causes them to get cold very easily.</p><p>Peterbalds are very intelligent and can learn tricks like dogs. These active and highly athletic cats love nothing more than to spend their time playing with their humans, and they're eager to participate in games with toys or puzzles.</p><p>Because the Peterbald is so active and playful and craves interaction with its family it makes an excellent family pet. However, playtime with children or other pets should generally be supervised, as the cat's lack of fur means that it is vulnerable to injury.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Because many Peterbald cats are hairless, sunburn, sensitivity to hot and cold weather, and other skin issues are potential concerns. Their delicate skin can also be easily injured, such as when playing with a cat companion or roughhousing with children.</p><p>Otherwise, these cats are associated with surprisingly few breed-related health issues, provided they are properly cared for and receive scheduled vaccinations.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The Peterbald's hair varies in type, from a fuzzy velour coat to a completely ""nude,"" hairless body. There's even an ""ultra-bald"" type that doesn't even have whiskers or eyebrows (and their skin often feels sticky to the touch).</p><p>Interestingly, a Peterbald's coat at birth may not represent its adult appearance. Peterbalds' coats can change significantly throughout the first two years of life. Their hair texture can change, or they may grow or lose hair.</p><p>The Peterbald retains distinct characteristics from its ancestry. It owes its variable hair, dexterous front paws, and wrinkly skin to the Don Sphynx, while its long, lithe body and oblong head shape can be attributed to the Oriental shorthair.</p><p>One unique feature about Peterbalds is that they have long front toes with webbing, which allows them to hold and manipulate toys and other items.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Like all breeds, the Peterbald cat can be susceptible to weight-related issues such as obesity or heart disease, so they should be fed a high-protein, high-quality diet and receive plenty of exercise in the form of playtime with their families.</p><p>The good news is that, also due to their lack of fur, Peterbalds typically have a faster metabolism than cats with full coats, which means that they have healthy appetites; their high metabolism also helps them heal faster than fully-coated kitties when it comes to wounds or scratches.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Peterbald Cat</h2><p>Peterbald cats are still somewhat rare, so it may be difficult to find a breeder for a Peterbald kitten; additionally, hairless cats are often sold for high prices. If possible, talk to other Peterbald cat owners, reputable breeders, and rescue groups to learn more about locating this particular breed.</p><h2>Peterbald Cat Overview</h2><p>Peterbald cats are exceptionally outgoing and energetic. They are a smart and independent breed that will form strong bonds with their family members, including other cats (and even dogs). These energetic cats are actually considered to be rather ""dog-like"" in that they are affectionate and cuddly while also wanting to be involved in the day-to-day activities of the household. In addition, like some dogs, they tend to use their voices to communicate with their owners.</p><p>Social and affectionate</p><p>Generally healthy</p><p>Fun to play or just interact with</p><p>Highly sensitive to temperature extremes</p><p>Susceptible to injury</p><p>Difficult to find and expensive</p>",898

These sleek dogs were bred to be companions. And if there's a warm lap for them to curl up in, that's where they'd love to spend their time. Still, these dogs are quick and nimble with a hound's hunting instinct, and they love to play too.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Toy</p><p>Height: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 14 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short, smooth</p><p>Coat Color: Gray, black, fawn, chocolate, tan, cream, red, sable, or a combination</p><p>Life Span: 14 to 15 years</p><p>Temperament: Affectionate, playful, companionable</p><p>Hypoallergenic: Yes</p><p>Origin: Italy</p><h2>Characteristics of the Italian Greyhound</h2><p>Italian greyhounds generally have a sensitive and sociable personality. And playfulness is typical of their temperament. They love to be around people and even get along well with other dogs. </p><h2>History of the Italian Greyhound</h2><p>The Italian greyhound is an ancient dog breed that originated over 2,000 years ago in the Mediterranean region. Artifacts from the area show images of the breed, and the dogs' miniature skeletons have been discovered in archaeological digs. These dogs were likely kept around for both companionship and small-game hunting.</p><p>In Renaissance Italy, the breed became a lapdog of the wealthy. It was beloved by royal families and aristocrats, and many Renaissance-era portraits even depict nobles with their canine companions. </p><p>The breed made its way to North America in the 19th century. The American Kennel Club first recognized it in 1886.</p><h2>Italian Greyhound Care</h2><p>Italian greyhounds need some exercise and mental stimulation to get their energy out every day. And they should receive consistent training and socialization. Their grooming typically is not a huge time commitment.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Italian greyhounds love napping in a cozy spot, but they also need regular exercise to be healthy and happy. Aim for at least an hour per day of physical activity. Typically a couple of short walks plus playtime throughout the day should suffice. You also can offer puzzle toys or enroll in dog sports to provide both mental stimulation and physical activity. </p><p>Don't forget about this small hound's high prey drive when heading outside. Always keep it in a securely fenced area or on leash to prevent it from running off to chase perceived prey. Furthermore, if you live in a cold climate, keep outdoor time brief in chilly weather. This breed is sensitive to the cold because of its short coat and low body fat. Many owners have coats and sweaters to provide extra warmth for their dogs.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Use a grooming mitt on the Italian greyhound's short, smooth coat roughly every week to remove loose fur and debris, and distribute skin oils. The coat typically stays relatively clean, but you can bathe your dog roughly every month, depending on how dirty it gets. </p><p>Aim to brush your dog's teeth daily, as this breed is prone to dental issues. Discuss the need for professional teeth cleanings with your vet as well. Look in your dog's ears at least weekly for wax buildup and irritation. Check its nails about once a month to see whether they need a trim.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Always use positive, rewards-based training methods with this breed. Italian greyhounds can be sensitive and stubborn when it comes to harsh corrections, potentially shutting down and refusing to learn. Immediately offer praise and/or a treat for positive behavior, and be consistent with your commands. Aim to begin training from a young age to prevent the development of bad habits.</p><p>Moreover, make an effort to socialize your Italian greyhound ideally from an early age. Expose it to different people, other dogs, and various locations. This will help to boost its comfort and make it a more adaptable, well-adjusted dog.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Always have fresh water accessible for your dog. Feed a nutritionally balanced canine diet. It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But you should always discuss the recommended type and amount of food with your vet. Monitor treats and other extra food closely to prevent your dog from overeating. Even minor weight gain can be significant for such a small dog and put unnecessary pressure on its joints.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Italian Greyhound</h2><p>Italian greyhounds aren't a common dog breed, but it's still worth checking local animal shelters and rescue groups for a dog in need of a home. If you're looking for a puppy from a reputable breeder, expect to pay around $600 to $1,200, though this can vary widely.</p><h2>Italian Greyhound Overview</h2><p>Affectionate and family-oriented</p><p>Adaptable to different living situations, including small homes</p><p>Simple grooming needs</p><p>Prone to dental problems</p><p>Doesn't tolerate cold weather well</p><p>Can be sensitive and stubborn about training</p>",765

People who had previously engaged in stag hunting with their packs of dogs had turned their attention to a new target in the fox due to the decrease in the deer population. So they crossed their large stag-hunting hounds, with their sharp noses and good endurance, with faster and more agile greyhounds and similar dogs. </p><p>The English foxhound took shape, and today's version still strongly resembles the dog that arose hundreds of years ago. Fox hunting was still an elite pastime during the 1700s.</p><p>The English foxhound still remains relatively rare in North America, compared to the American foxhound. The American Kennel Club first recognized the English version in 1909.</p><h2>English Foxhound Care</h2><p>Expect to spend lots of time exercising this active breed. Fortunately, it generally only requires basic grooming. And it usually takes well to training.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Aim for at least two hours per day of exercise for an English foxhound. This dog loves to run and explore outdoors. But it's important to keep it on a leash or in a securely fenced area; otherwise it can quickly run off chasing perceived prey. Long walks, hikes, running, and cycling all are ideal activities to get some of a foxhound's energy out. Plus, dog sports, such as agility and tracking, can provide mental stimulation as well as physical activity.</p><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Brush your dog weekly to remove loose fur and distribute skin oils. Expect periods of higher shedding, often in the spring and fall as the weather changes, during which you'll have to brush more frequently to keep up with the loose fur. </p><p>Bathe your foxhound every month or so, depending on how dirty it gets. And see whether its ears need cleaning at least weekly. Also, make sure to dry the ears well anytime they get wet. Trim your dog's nails roughly once a month. And aim to brush its teeth every day with a canine toothpaste.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Begin training and socialization ideally when your dog is a puppy to instill good manners and prevent bad habits from forming. A puppy obedience class can teach both basic commands and social skills. </p><p>English foxhounds typically respond well to positive training methods, such as treats and praise. But they can be a bit stubborn.

It's typical to feed two measured meals per day. But because this breed is prone to bloat and potentially life-threatening stomach twisting, which can arise from eating too quickly, you might want to feed smaller, more frequent meals. Also, aim to keep your dog calm around mealtimes.

Norfolks are sturdy and athletic little dogs, as they were originally bred to exterminate rodents in barns. They have a well-balanced body with dark, oval eyes and small, drop ears. Longer fur around the neck and shoulders creates a mane.

Breeders were developing small working terriers primarily to be used for ratting, as well as fox hunting. </p><p>This is how both the Norfolk and Norwich terriers arose. They initially were considered one breed, even though the Norfolk has drop ears while the Norwich has upright ears. It's thought that small local terriers were crossed with short-legged Irish terriers and red Romani terriers to get this breed.</p><p>Interbreeding between the Norfolk and Norwich terriers ceased after World War II.

The American Kennel Club accepted the breed in 1979.</p><h2>Norfolk Terrier Care</h2><p>Norfolk terriers are active, playful dogs, but it doesn't take an extreme amount of exercise to tire them out. They do require some specialized grooming.

The breed name is also sometimes spelled Xoloitzcuintle. The Xolo (show-low), as it's affectionately known, comes in three sizes: standard, miniature, and toy. Although the hairless variety is the best known, the Xolo also comes in a coated variety. Coated Xoloitzcuintli sport a short, smooth coat that covers the entire body. Hairless Xolos are completely bare-skinned, although they sometimes sprout a few tufts of hair on the top of the head, on the feet, and on the last third of the tail. Although breeders might focus on one size or coat variety, all three sizes and the two different coat types can pop up in the same litter. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Non-Sporting</p><p>Height: Standard: 18 to 23 inches tall at the shoulder; Miniature: 14 to 18 inches; Toy: 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: Standard: 30 to 55 pounds; Miniature: 15 to 30 pounds; Toy: 10 to 15 pounds</p><p>Coat: Hairless: A small amount of short, coarse hair may appear on the top of the head, the feet, and the end of the tail. Coated: Short, smooth, and close-fitting coat</p><p>Coat Color: A range of dark colors, including black, gray-black, slate, red, liver (brown), or bronze</p><p>Lifespan: 14 to 17 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent and protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No. Despite its hairlessness, most of the dander lives in its saliva</p><p>Origin: Mexico<br/></p><h2>Characteristics of the Xolo</h2><p>The Xoloitzcuintli is active and agile. They are generally calm indoors as long as they get enough exercise in the form of daily walks and romps in the backyard. They are intelligent and sensitive,</p><p>You might think that with no hair, the Xolo is hypoallergenic. Although it's true that the breed might be good for some allergy sufferers, it depends on whether the individual is sensitive to dog hair or dog dander (dried saliva and material shed from an animal's skin). The Xolo lacks hair, but has plenty of dander. It's best for allergy sufferers to spend lots of time with adult Xolos (preferably in a home where Xolos live) in order to determine if they react to them or not. That said, in general, the Xolo is one of the breeds considered good for people who suffer from dog allergies. </p><h2>History of the Xolo</h2><p>The Xoloitzcuintli is an ancient breed that traces its roots back to the time of the Aztecs, making the breed at least 3,500 years old. According to the Xoloitzcuintli Club of America, the breed name is a combination of the name of the dog god Xolotl and the Aztec word Itzcuintli, which means dog. The Xolo is the national dog of Mexico. The Xoloitzcuintli is recognized by the American Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club, the Canadian Kennel Club, the Mexican Kennel Club, and the international kennel club Fédération Cynologique International.</p><p>In ancient Mexico, the Xoloitzcuintli was sacred. The dogs were frequently sacrificed and placed in the graves of their recently deceased owners because they were thought to help safely guide their owners' souls into the land of the dead. They were also thought to cure various health conditions.</p><h2>Xoloitzcuintli (Mexican Hairless Dog) Care</h2><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Xoloitzcuintli are pretty low maintenance where exercise is concerned: several daily walks are all they need to stay healthy and in good shape.</p><h2>Grooming</h2><p>In addition to skin or coat care and bathing, your Xolo needs regular toothbrushing and nail trimming.</p><h3>Training</h3><p>Xolos are easy to train as long as you use positive methods and don't overwhelm them. Socialization is extremely important for this breed, which can be wary and cautious of strangers. Start socializing early in puppyhood, and continue throughout the life of the dog. </p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>The Xoloitzcuintli is quite healthy. Some hairless Xolos may not have a full set of teeth (something that is likely correlated to the gene that causes hairlessness), but this does not usually cause any problems for the dog. Responsible breeders perform standard tests on their Xolos before breeding them, including screening for hip dysplasia and patella luxation, as well as heart and eye diseases. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Some Xoloitzcuintli are prone to becoming overweight. Feed your Xolo high-quality dog food and measure out regular meals with a measuring cup or scale to avoid overfeeding. Free feeding (leaving food out all day) can lead to weight gain. Overweight dogs may experience joint or hip issues, and other health conditions like diabetes. Ask your breeder or veterinarian to recommend the best food for your Xolo.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Xoloitzcuintli</h2><p>The Xoloitzcuintli is a rare breed. Some adults might find their way into rescue, but usually, people wanting to bring home a Xolo will be buying a puppy. Make sure yours comes from a reputable breeder.

If you see a little debris in the ears, use a gentle pet ear cleanser to clean the ears with a cotton ball and (never stick a cotton swab into a cat's ear). If the ears look inflamed or excessively dirty, or if your cat is shaking his head or scratching his ears, schedule a checkup with your veterinarian.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>There are a few ways you can help your colorpoint shorthair get enough exercise and indoor enrichment. First, provide plenty of places to climb and perch (cat trees and kitty condos). Also, all cats need to scratch, which is a natural and enjoyable behavior. To keep your couch and rugs in good shape, give your colorpoint shorthair a variety of acceptable scratching places, both vertical and horizontal (cardboard or sisal scratchers that lie on the ground).</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>All cats can develop health issues throughout their lives, but as with all pedigreed cats, the colorpoint shorthair has some known congenital problems in its background.</p><p>Reputable breeders test their adult cats for health problems and avoid breeding affected cats. Most reputable breeders also usually offer a health guarantee.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Like its Siamese cousin, the elegant colorpoint shorthair is long and lean with a fine bone structure and firm musculature. Its distinctive wedge-shaped head is set off by large ears and accentuated by almond-shaped blue eyes. The close-lying short coat is glossy with a fine texture. </p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Colorpoint shorthairs should be long and lean, and keeping your cat at an ideal weight can prevent health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and arthritis. Feed your colorpoint shorthair measured amounts of cat food regularly (twice a day for adult cats), and avoid free-feeding (leaving food out all day), which encourages continuous snacking.</p><p>Ask your veterinarian or breeder for advice about the best food to feed your colorpoint shorthair cat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Colorpoint Shorthair</h2><p>If you're thinking about buying a colorpoint shorthair kitten, consider going to a local cat show, which is a great way to connect with reputable breeders. Cat shows are lots of fun and you can see many different cat breeds all in the same place.</p><h2>Colorpoint Shorthair Overview</h2><p>With all the loud, loving feline fabulousness of a Siamese and a rainbow of gorgeous coat colors, the colorpoint shorthair makes a delightful pet for attentive owners. This cat will thrive with nearly constant companionship from humans (including kids), other cats, or gentle dogs. Besides its neediness, this breed is low maintenance, requiring little in the way of grooming.</p><p>Affectionate, friendly and outgoing </p><p>Entertaining and talkative </p><p>Low shedding</p><p>Doesn't do well if left alone</p><p>Loud for a cat (lots of vocalization)</p><p>Prone to a few genetic health problems</p>",828

One calico may be a bold combination of vibrant red and black, while another is a more subdued shade of cream mixed with blue. In feline genetics, the latter is known as a ""dilute calico.""</p><p>The various patterns of the calico patches are almost as unique as snowflakes, so you'll never see two exactly alike. Their personalities are equally interesting; calico cats are known for their sass and spunk, but they are also loving and loyal companions for owners of all ages.</p><p>Interestingly, calicoes are almost all female, and the rare male is always sterile.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Sassy, spunky, bold, affectionate, independent, loyal</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: About 18 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair and Long Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Black and red, blue and cream, or lilac and cream</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tri-color (calico)</p><p>Eye Color: Yellow, green, or blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Possibly Egypt and the Mediterranean Coast</p><h2>Calico Cat Characteristics</h2><p>The calico is a medium-sized domestic cat renowned for its spunky, assertive personality. While it's a generally independent cat that doesn't require constant attention, the calico is also sweet, loving, and loyal. It will readily bond with a single owner but enjoy the company of an entire family, too.</p><p>Calicoes differ from tortoiseshell cats, whose colors (red and black) are interwoven throughout the coat instead of appearing in distinct patches of solid color.<br/></p><h2>History of the Calico Cat</h2><p>No one is sure where the calico breed originated, though it is speculated that it emerged from Egypt and was traded along the Mediterranean</p><p>Researchers began seriously studying calico cats in the 1940s. Murray Barr and his graduate student E.G. Bertram noticed dark, drumstick-shaped masses inside the nuclei of nerve cells of female cats, but not in male cats. These dark masses eventually were called Barr bodies. In 1959, Japanese cell biologist Susumu Ohno determined the Barr bodies were X chromosomes. In 1961, Mary Lyon proposed the concept of X-inactivation: one of the two X chromosomes inside a female mammal shuts off. She observed this in the coat color patterns in mice, similar to the patterns of calico cats.</p><p>Calico cats are believed to bring good luck in the folklore of many cultures. In the United States, these are sometimes referred to as ""money cats."" In Japan, Maneki-Neko are good luck figures that depict calico cats.</p><h2>Calico Cat Care</h2><p>The care of a calico cat will largely depend on its breed rather than its coat pattern. Shorthaired calicoes' coats, for example, will require less brushing than those of longhaired breeds.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>Regardless of the breed, a male calico cat is prone to a genetic health condition called Klinefelter's Syndrome. In addition to being sterile, these cats experience cognitive and developmental issues, behavioral problems, reduced bone mineral content, and obesity.</p><p>Female calico cats do not have health problems that correlate with their color patterns, but they may have issues specific to their respective breeds.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Calico cats are some of the most strikingly patterned cats, wearing bold patches of colors that include red, black, white, blue, and cream. According to the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) show standards for Calico Persians, the cat should be a tri-color cat of black, red, and white with white feet, legs, belly, chest, and muzzle. The cat should also have a colored tail and one or more colored patches on the head and/or body.<br/></p><p>Calicoes' eye colors include copper, blue, green, or odd-eyed. (In show-quality Persians, odd-eyed bi-colors should have one blue and one copper eye with equal color depth.)</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A wholesome cat food, dried and/or canned, is generally a great option for feeding calicoes of any breed. However, research your specific breed of cat to find out if it has any unique dietary requirements.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Calico Cat</h2><p>Calico cats are not rare but finding one at a local shelter can be hit-or-miss. Check with breeders in your areas to see if any specialize in calico patterns, or search online adoption sites to locate a kitten or cat in your area.</p><h2>Types of Calico cat</h2><p>It would be easier to give a list of those breeds which do accept calicoes than those that do. Calicoes are not allowed in pointed breeds, such as the Siamese or Himalayan, nor those which allow only solid colors, such as the Bombay, Russian blue, and the British shorthair.</p><h2>Breed Overview</h2><p>The calico is not a breed and has no technically identifiable personality traits, but owners and enthusiasts often insist that the calico pattern seems to impart a particular pep and sass in female felines that carry the colorful genes. These friendly, outgoing cats have a flair for independence but also enjoy socializing with their human families and other pets.<br/></p><p>Striking color pattern</p><p>Friendly and outgoing</p><p>Considered ""good luck"" cats</p><p>Can not be bred because males are sterile</p><p>Males are rare but prone to health problems</p><p>Might be hard to find a calico locally</p>",801

Known for its playfully curious nature, the Somali enjoys interacting with humans and does not adjust well to boredom. It makes a wonderful cat companion for someone who spends most of their time at home or has other pets to keep the Somali company. Solitary Somalis, however, are notorious mischief-makers.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Playful, intelligent, sociable, affectionate, mischievous</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 26 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Medium-long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Red, ruddy, blue, fawn, and sorrel</p><p>Coat Patterns: Ticked</p><p>Eye Color: Green or gold</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 14 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Australia</p><h2>Somali Cat Characteristics</h2><p>You'll rarely find a Somali lying around this cat has energy to burn! Active, curious, and sociable, the medium-sized Somali is always on the lookout for something to do and someone to do it with. If unsupervised or under-stimulated for too long, the Somali is likely to create its own entertainment. Climbing curtains, scaling the refrigerator, or tipping knick-knacks off shelves are just a few of the fun activities that may be on the menu. Svelte and muscular, the long-haired Somali is beautiful to behold, which may make up for some of the mischief it may make when left alone.</p><h2>History of the Somali Cat</h2><p>Essentially a longer-haired version of the Abyssinian cat, the Somali cat has a rather mysterious history. Some experts theorize that a recessive gene was introduced into the Abyssinian breed population in the early 1900s through crossbreeding with long-haired cats of unknown origin.</p><p>The one thing breed historians know for sure is that the first Somali, then referred to as a ""long-haired Abyssinian,"" appeared in Australian cat shows in 1965. Thereafter, breeders began actively developing Somalis as a breed. Today, all major cat associations recognize the unique and relatively rare Somali cat breed.</p><h2>Somali Cat Care</h2><h3>Grooming</h3><p>Somali cats have soft, silky coats that require regular brushing (once or twice a week) to keep their coats free from tangles. Somali cats often enjoy being groomed, which makes the job much easier.</p><p>These cats also benefit from regular tooth brushing because they are prone to periodontal disease, and occasional veterinary dental cleanings will also help prevent the development of gum or tooth issues.</p><h3>Exercise</h3><p>Rambunctious, intelligent, and active, Somalis have relatively high exercise needs compared to other cat breeds. Play with your Somali multiple times a day to help it burn energy and to strengthen your bond with your cat.</p><p>If you're feeling adventurous, you can even take your Somali cat on leashed walks. Somalis love the outdoors and spending time with their humans, so this is a win-win. And because Somali cats are so intelligent and eager to exercise, they are easily trained. They are known to play fetch on occasion and learn commands like ""sit"" and ""stay"". Just make sure to keep sessions positive and rewarding.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>If you're purchasing your Somali from a breeder, ask for proof that their cats are free of these conditions before committing to buy.<br/></p><p>Like most other cat breeds, the Somali is prone to plaque and tartar buildup, which can lead to periodontal disease.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Somalis are stunning cats with flowing, soft coats and muscular bodies. While their coat is medium length over most of their bodies, they have longer, fluffy tails and tufts of hair between their toes. Inspired by their ruddy coloration and plumed tails, these cats have been called ""fox-like"" in appearance. Somalis have large ears and eyes that always seem alert and attuned to any action happening around them.<br/></p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>Because Somalis are so active and muscular, they need high-quality cat food with plenty of protein to remain in good shape. Stick to foods with quality meat-based ingredients and avoid ones with unnecessary fillers or grains with little nutritional value.</p><p>Your best resource is your veterinarian. They will be able to let you know which foods will be best suited for your Somali cat.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Somali</h2><p>Somalis are a relatively rare breed, but the Somali Breed Council maintains a directory of reputable breeders.

Check Petfinder for cats with Somali characteristics.<br/></p><h2>Somali Overview</h2><p>With regular exercise like intensive training sessions to tire out their minds and bodies, Somalis are less likely to get into trouble in the house. But if you leave your Somali home alone for long, you may return to ripped-up tissues or a dumped-over garbage can.

It came about as the result of an accidental mating between a Burmese and a Chinchilla Persian in the 1980s. This sturdy yet elegant cat boasts a silvery-white coat and almost appears to be wearing eyeliner and nose liner! The breed, while still relatively rare, is beloved by its enthusiasts for being playful, inquisitive, and gentle.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Friendly, playful, curious, and sociable with an independent streak</p><p>Weight: Up to 12 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 20 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short hair or semi-long hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Silver-white with tips or shading that can include black, blue, chocolate, cream, lilac, and tortoiseshell</p><p>Coat Patterns: Shaded or tipped</p><p>Eye Color: Green</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 15 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: United Kingdom</p><h2>Burmilla Characteristics</h2><p>The burmilla breed is affectionate and sweet-natured. It loves attention but not in the sometimes demanding manner of the Burmese. It tends to be relatively quiet, although it is generally more playful and curious than the Persian. Burmillas can even be a bit mischievous and are known for having slightly goofy, almost clown-like characters.<br/></p><p>Although they do enjoy the company of their people, they have an independent streak, so they make great cats for working owners. They also tend to get along well with other cats and dogs, providing the introductions have been done carefully.<br/></p><h2>History of the Burmilla</h2><p>The burmilla has a rather noble and recent history. The breed began quite by accident in the early 1980s when a Chinchilla Persian and a Burmese, owned by a baroness in the United Kingdom, mated unexpectedly.</p><p>The resulting kittens had darkly shaded, thick, short coats. They were so striking that the Baroness, who already bred Persians, decided to develop a breeding program for this type of cross.</p><p>They gained championship status in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, but it wasn't until 2011 that the Cat Fanciers' Association recognized the burmilla breed.</p><h2>Burmilla Care</h2><p>Short-haired burmillas require little in the way of grooming; an occasional brushing will help remove loose hair and keep their coats shiny. Longer-haired burmillas benefit from regular (weekly) brushings and an occasional bath to keep their silky hair free of tangles.<br/></p><p>Burmilla cats often retain a kitten-like exuberance for life well into adulthood, making them fun pets. Because of this playful and curious streak, though, you should make sure your burmilla is getting enough stimulation and enrichment around the home. A bored burmilla could seek out its own means of entertainment and that could include destructive behavior.<br/></p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>So far, the burmilla does not appear to have any specific genetic problems. Periodontal disease is one of the most common health problems for any cat breed. Making sure you provide a good quality diet and trying to introduce a dental hygiene regime from a young age can be beneficial.</p><p>If your cat tolerates having its teeth brushed a few times a week, this can make a big difference. You should always introduce the toothbrush gradually, keeping sessions short. If you pair it with lots of positive rewards, then your cat should learn to accept these sessions more willingly.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>The burmilla is a muscular yet elegant medium-sized cat with a thick double-layered coat that feels soft and silky. Occasionally, burmillas can have a slightly longer coat that is classed as semi-long hair. This is a result of the recessive gene from the Chinchilla.</p><p>Burmillas come in a variety of coat colors and patterns. They are either tipped or shaded. If they have a tipped coat, this means they have a light color that covers a silver or golden undercoat. The silver-tipped cats can often look close to white. Shaded burmilla have a darker color pattern that primarily appears over the top of their back and shoulders and on the outside of their legs.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>The burmilla, like all cats, will need a quality, high-protein diet. They are not as prone to obesity as some other breeds, but care should still be taken to ensure you do not overfeed them.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Burmilla</h2><p>Because of their rarity, you may have to travel a fair distance or be on a waiting list to secure a burmilla kitten. The Fanciers' Breeder Referral List (FBRL) maintains a directory of cat breeders, including the few burmilla breeders in the United States.</p><h2>Burmilla Overview</h2><p>The burmilla is a very adaptable breed, and they make excellent family pets.

Tabbies are often thought of as a breed, but their characteristic markings are a coat pattern that can appear in different breeds with a surprising amount of variation. Tabbies can be brown, gray, orange, or even black, and their markings include stripes, spots, whorls, and bands.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Personality: Friendly, independent, outgoing, adventurous</p><p>Weight: Up to 18 pounds</p><p>Length: Up to 40 inches</p><p>Coat Length: Short Hair or Long Hair</p><p>Coat Colors: Brown, gray, orange, or black</p><p>Coat Patterns: Tabby</p><p>Eye Color: Green, gold, or blue</p><p>Lifespan: Up to 18 years</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Ancient Egypt</p><h2>Tabby Cat Characteristics</h2><p>It is no surprise the tabby cat is ubiquitous-the gene for the tabby pattern can be found in all domestic cats (look at a coal-black cat in the sun, and you may see hidden tabby markings). These wildly patterned pets vary in size and temperament because they encompass so many different breeds, but tabby enthusiasts agree that friendly, curious, outgoing personalities are common among tabbies.</p><h2>History of the Tabby Cat</h2><p>Some say the tabby originated with the Mau, an ancient Egyptian breed developed from the domestication of the African wildcat. Its modern descendant is the Egyptian Mau, which bears a tabby pattern. Perhaps the most distinctive feature seen in the Mau and other tabby cats is the vague marking of the letter ""M"" on their foreheads. </p><p>According to a Biblical legend, a tabby visited the manger. When Mary asked the stable animals to surround the manger and warm baby Jesus, a little tabby cat nestled next to the baby with soothing warmth and purrs. Mary was so grateful she bestowed her initial, ""M,"" on the cat's forehead.</p><p>Islamic legends tell of how much Mohammed loved cats. He once cut off a sleeve of a garment when he had to leave to attend prayer rather than disturb his cat, Muezza, who was sleeping upon the sleeve. Such stories assume that Mohammed bestowed the ""M"" marking on tabbies to symbolize his adoration. Today, cats are still generally protected and respected in the Islamic world; they are even permitted inside mosques.</p><p>The word ""tabby"" was originally an English name for striped silk fabric in the 17th and 18th centuries. It was first used to describe striped cats in the 1690s. In 1871, a 21-pound ""English tabby"" was documented as having appeared at the very first cat show in the world held at the Crystal Palace in London.</p><h2>Tabby Cat Care</h2><p>The care of a tabby will largely depend on its breed rather than its coat pattern. For instance, a Maine coon tabby will require more brushing, coat care, and possibly hairball medication than a Manx tabby. When it comes to exercise, an Ocicat will need a lot more room to play than a Persian tabby.</p><h2>Common Health Problems</h2><p>While a mixed breed tabby is generally healthy and robust, many pure breeds have health problems that are unique and require individualized care.</p><h2>Appearance</h2><p>Tabby cats range in size and shape from petite to ponderous. They even have a great deal of variation within their tabby patterns.</p><p>A fifth pattern is recognized when patches of tabby markings appear on a calico or tortoiseshell cat. They are referred to as caliby and torbie, respectively.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition</h2><p>A wholesome cat food, dried and/or canned, is generally a great option for feeding tabbies of any breed. However, research your specific breed of cat to find out if it has any unique dietary requirements.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Tabby Cat</h2><p>Since tabbies are so common among the general cat population, finding one can be as simple as visiting your local shelter and adopting a kitten or adult cat.

This athletic breed is known for the ridge of hair along its back that grows in the opposite direction from the other hair. Thai Ridgebacks are deeply loyal, fierce, protective, and hard-working dogs that are rarely seen outside of Thailand.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Group: Hound</p><p>Height: 20 to 24 inches</p><p>Weight: Males: 50 to 60 pounds; Females: 35 to 55 pounds</p><p>Coat: Short and smooth</p><p>Coat Colors: Black, blue, fawn, or red</p><p>Life Span: 12-15 years</p><p>Temperament: Intelligent, loyal, independent, bold, protective</p><p>Hypoallergenic: No</p><p>Origin: Thailand<br/></p><h2> Characteristics of the Thai Ridgeback </h2><p>While they may boast a somewhat intimidating appearance, Thai Ridgebacks are among the most loyal and underrepresented dog breeds. Their playful and energetic nature makes them perfectly suited to an active household, and they respond well to firm but kind training.</p><h2> History of the Thai Ridgeback </h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is considered a ""pariah-type"" dog, a term used to describe partially wild, free-range dogs that live on the outskirts of human civilization and reproduce almost entirely by natural selection. Pariah dogs like the Thai Ridgeback have remained much the same over time because there were few opportunities for them to breed with different types of dogs.</p><p>The pariah dog ancestors of Thai Ridgebacks can be traced back to ancient Thailand and likely originated around the time dogs first began to evolve from wolves. It is unclear when the Thai Ridgeback actually evolved from Asian pariah dogs, but evidence of the breed can be found in Thai writings from the 17th century. Thai Ridgebacks can be found primarily in Eastern Thailand and the islands of Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam. It is believed that Thai fishermen once brought the breed to neighboring islands.</p><p>Thai Ridgebacks were historically used as watchdogs, hunting dogs, and to escort carts. They were even used to kill cobras in some areas. The Dog Association of Thailand was founded in 1976 and recognized the indigenous Thai Ridgeback as an official breed. Thai Ridgebacks were first brought to the United States in 1994 by rare dog breed enthusiast Jack Sterling. The breed has been a member of the AKC's Foundation Stock Service since 1997 and has been designated part of the Hound group.</p><h2> Thai Ridgeback Care </h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is a low-maintenance breed that will be happy in your home does best in moderate to warm climates and is not well-suited for cold temperatures. This breed should live indoors and have access to a yard with a fence if possible.</p><h3> Exercise </h3><p>Thai Ridgebacks are athletic dogs that need daily exercise to keep them in shape and provide an outlet for energy and prevent boredom. Active dogs may benefit from involvement in various dog sports, and puzzles or games are a great indoor option for cold weather climates.</p><h3> Grooming </h3><p>The Thai Ridgeback needs minimal grooming. Occasional brushing is typically all that is needed to keep the coat shiny and remove dead hairs. This breed has no undercoat and tends to shed very little. However, shedding will increase seasonally and can be reduced by brushing their coat and bathing as needed. As with any dog, their nails should be trimmed regularly and their ears should be checked and cleaned periodically.</p><h3> Training </h3><p>Training and socialization are essential for the independent and sometimes stubborn Thai Ridgeback. Begin a training routine with your dog or puppy as soon as possible, whether doing it on your own or getting help from a dog trainer. Be consistent and firm yet gentle, using positive reinforcement methods over aversives. Thai Ridgebacks are independent and bold, so they respond best to people with natural leadership qualities.</p><p>Be sure to socialize your Thai Ridgeback at an early age, exposing them to as many people and animals as possible. This breed has a high prey drive and is likely to chase small animals like cats. Some Thai Ridgebacks can be aggressive with other dogs if not properly socialized. In addition, these dogs should be exposed to children at a young age and taught how to behave properly so they will be kid-friendly as adults.</p><h2> Common Health Problems </h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is generally a healthy dog breed. Responsible dog breeders take care to breed to ensure health problems are not passed on to puppies. There are few conditions known to affect Thai Ridgebacks.</p><h2> Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Proper nutrition is important for all dogs, and the Thai Ridgeback is no exception. Choose a high-quality dog food rich in animal proteins. A combination of wet and dry food can help entice your dog to eat well and will also help maintain hydration. Puppies should be fed food labeled for growth until about one year of age.</p><h2> Where to Adopt or Buy a Thai Ridgeback </h2><p>The Thai Ridgeback is a rare dog breed outside of Southeast Asia, so it may be difficult to find an established breeder or rescue group in your area. Contact local dog breeders, veterinarians, and pet professionals to find out if Thai Ridgebacks are available in your region. Visit nationally recognized breed groups to find out more about opportunities to get your own Thai Ridgeback.</p><h2> Thai Ridgeback Overview </h2><p>Fiercely loyal to family</p><p>Needs little grooming</p><p>Athletic and hard-working</p><p>High prey drive may pose a risk around cats and other smaller animals</p><p>Rare and may be difficult to find purebred puppies</p><p>Can be stubborn</p>",892
