There are more than 30 species of Amazons; 10 types are common as pets. Most Amazon parrots have a green body. Depending on the species, they can have distinct feather colorings on their head that include red, lilac, yellow, purple, blue, and more. Some display various colors on their shoulders, tail feathers, and beak.</p><p>These medium-to-large birds can live for decades with good care. They require consistent attention, a varied diet, space for exercise, and training, especially if you want a less noisy, gentle bird. Several species are pretty good talkers and mimics, too. </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Double yellow-headed Amazon, yellow-naped Amazon, yellow-fronted Amazon, blue-fronted Amazon, orange-winged Amazo, green-cheeked Amazons, Panama Amazon, white-fronted Amazon (spectacled Amazon), mealy Amazon, red-lored Amazon, lilac-crowned Amazon</p><p>Adult Size: Roughly 10 to 20 inches from head to tail (varies by species)</p><p>Lifespan: 30+ years</p><h2>Amazon Parrot Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Amazons are brilliant and playful birds that love being the center of attention. They need lots of affection and time with their owners. They are curious and athletic, and they seem to enjoy entertaining their owners with clownish antics. Amazons that have been hand-tamed from a young age typically are comfortable with handling and make loving, affectionate pets.</p><p>However, Amazon parrots can be somewhat moody as they reach sexual maturity and might become aggressive if not trained and handled correctly. This is called abluffing stage. While the phase does pass, it can sometimes last for up to two years. During the bluffing stage, Amazons might bite and show other aggressive behaviors. It's more apparent in males, and some birds act out more than others. Because of this, you might want to consider a female parrot or an older bird.</p><p>Owners can learn to read their Amazon's body language to understand its mood. For instance, a parrot with narrowing pupils and raised head feathers might be overexcited and prone to biting if it's not given a chance to calm down.</p><p>In general, most Amazon species can learn to talk. As for other vocalizations, Amazons can be quite loud and chatter frequently. They are also good screechers, though not as loud as cockatoos or macaws. These loud vocalizations are how birds communicate with their flockusually indicating danger, anger, excitement, or calling for attention.</p><p>Except to spend several hours per day interacting with your bird, as well as feeding it and maintaining its habitat. Amazons can become bored, depressed, and destructive if they're left alone too much. They can enjoy the company of other birds, though they must be introduced slowly and carefully to make sure they're a good match. They also often can coexist with other well-mannered household pets, including cats and dogs, but they should be supervised.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>In general, Amazons are around 10 to 20 inches long measured from head to tail. They weigh on average between 1 and 2 pounds. </p><h2>Housing </h2><p>An Amazon parrot's cage should be as large as you can fit and afford. At minimum, the cage should be 2 feet by 3 feet by 4 feet, but the bigger the better. Some owners even dedicate small rooms as free-flight aviaries for their pet birds. Make sure the cage bar spacing is narrow enough that your bird can't get any body parts stuck. </p><p>In the enclosure, including toys, swings, ladders, and perches of various sizes. Amazons like to chew, so make sure all items in the cage are safe and nontoxic. Moreover, include food and water dishes positioned in a spot where bird droppings won't fall in them.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>Many owners line the cage floor with dye-free paper, paper towels, or a similar material. Cages with grates allow waste to drop through, so your bird isn't walking in droppings. However, if the cage floor is a grate, make sure your bird has access to a flat surface somewhere to rest its feet.</p><h2>What Do Amazon Parrots Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Amazon parrots eata variety of seeds, nuts, fruits, berries, and vegetation in thewild. Pet Amazons should eat a pelleted bird food, along with fresh fruits and vegetables, every day. Discuss the quantity and variety with your vet, as nutritional requirements can vary based on size, age, and activity level.</p><p>Birds like to graze throughout the day, so place a day's worth of pellets in a chew-proof and tip-proof dish in the cage. Stainless steel dishes that attach to the side of the cage are a good option. Then, discard any uneaten pellets after 24 hours before adding the next day's portion. Fresh foods should be fed in a separate dish, ideally in the morning when your bird is waking up and hungry. Remove them after a few hours to prevent spoilage.</p><p>Finally, make sure your parrot always has access to fresh water. You can either use a water dish or a bottle that attaches to the side of the enclosure. Many birds like to dunk food in water dishes or even bathe in them, so bottles are typically easier to keep sanitary. But make sure your bird knows how to drink from the bottle before removing its water dish. Refresh the water daily. </p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Amazons are relatively healthy, long-lived birds.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians see birds as patients. So before acquiring a parrot, make sure there is an avian vet near you who can treat it.</p><h2>Training Your Amazon Parrot </h2><p>Hand-taming is the primary training most owners do with their birds to get them acclimated to household life. Allow your parrot to settle for at least a few days after bringing it home. Sit by it and talk to it, so it becomes comfortable with your presence. Start to offer treats through the cage bars to encourage the parrot to come toward you.</p><p>After it's comfortable with this, hold a perch in front of the bird's stomach, and give the command ""step up."" You can very gently press the perch into its stomach and hold a treat in front of the perch to encourage it to step up. Always hold the perch steady, and pause the training if your bird ever becomes stressed.</p><p>Finally, once your Amazon steps up onto a perch comfortably, give the same ""step up"" command while holding your hand in front of the bird's stomach. Offer treats and praise to make the handling a positive experience. </p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Because Amazons love to eat and are prone to obesity, they need lots of exercise to keep them healthy. Physical activity also provides essential mental stimulation for their intelligent brains. An Amazon needs at least three hours of out-of-cage time per day where it can move freely and stretch its muscles.</p><p>Keep toys both in and out of the cage to encourage activity. A bird play gym outside of the cage is a great option to interest your bird and get it moving. Puzzle toys also can offer both mental stimulation and exercise.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Most Amazon parrots love to bathe. And regular baths help to keep the bird's feathers in good shape. You can spritz your bird with warm water from a spray bottle, or offer it a shallow dish that it can splash around in. Some birds even enjoy getting in the shower with their owners. Offer a bath a few times a week (sometimes your bird might not be interested), and make sure your bird never gets chilled with wet feathers.</p><p>Furthermore, Amazons typically need periodic nail trims because they don't wear down their nails naturally like they would in the wild. A vet can trim your bird's nails for you and teach you how to do it at home.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary monthly cost for your Amazon will be its diet. Expect to spend around $15 to $25, though this can vary depending on the types of food you offer. You'll also have to periodically replace toys and other worn items in your bird's habitat, costing around $10 to $25 on average. Plus, make sure to budget for routine vet visits, such as wellness checkups and nail trims, and emergency care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping an Amazon Parrot as a Pet </h2><p>Amazon parrots can be very fun, entertaining, and affectionate pets. Most are quite social with their owners. However, they are a long-term commitment, which might not work for everyone's situation. And they need a lot of mental stimulation and exercise to keep them happy and healthy.</p><h2>Similar Pet Birds to the Amazon Parrot </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other large birds that can be your new pet. </p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Amazon Parrot </h2><p>It's best to go to a reputable breeder or rescue organization to acquire an Amazon parrot. You might see them in some pet shops, but those shops aren't always able to give good information on the bird's health, history, and temperament. Amazons can range in cost from around $100 and $1,000 on average, though this can vary widely depending on factors such as the bird's age. Adoption fees are typically less than breeder costs.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Local avian veterinarians might be able to direct you to a good Amazon parrot breeder or rescue. These birds are often seen for adoption because owners can't keep them for their full lifespan. The main benefit of going to a breeder is you'll likely have a wider selection of younger birds.</p><p>Aim to visit with the bird before bringing it home. Look for a bird that is active, alert, and in good body condition. Ask the seller about the bird's daily routine, diet, health, level of tameness, and any other questions you might have before committing.</p><p>Furthermore, in some Amazon species you can tell the males and females apart on sight while others require a DNA test. If you're interested in keeping more than one bird of the same species, ask the seller or a vet to confirm their sex, so you don't have any unexpected breeding.</p><p>Amazon parrots can be good pets for older children who are able to handle them with care. It's usually not ideal to put adolescent Amazons that might be aggressive with children.</p><p>Amazons require a moderate amount of upkeep that includes feeding them a varied diet and giving them several hours of attention per day.</p><p>Amazon parrots will learn to recognize their owners. They typically enjoy spending time with their favorite humans and even performing entertaining antics.</p><p>Amazon Care.</p>",1713
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/parrot-fever-psittacosis-symptoms-treatment-4148338,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Psittacosis (Parrot Fever) in Birds</h1>,"<h1>Psittacosis (Parrot Fever) in Birds</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Also known as parrot fever or avian chlamydiosis, psittacosis is an avian disease that many bird owners will encounter when caring for their pets. Psittacosis can be severe and even life-threatening, causing symptoms like lethargy, loss of appetite, weight loss, and more. This zoonotic disease can be found in many different species of birds, including popular pets like macaws, parakeets, cockatiels, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, lories, African grey parrots, lovebirds, conures, pigeons, and even pet ducks. Psittacosis is contagious and can spread through the air, and it can even infect humans. Bird owners should learn about the signs and prevention methods associated with psittacosis to help minimize the risk of this disease affecting their homes.</p><h2>What Is Psittacosis? </h2><p>Psittacosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium , affecting more than 400 species of birds and some mammals. It may also be caused by  and other bacteria. Psittacosis is transmitted from bird to bird, but it can also be contagious to some mammals (including humans) through infected birds.  is the bacterium that is typically seen in pet psittacines like parrots and is most commonly diagnosed.</p><h2>Symptoms of Psittacosis in Birds </h2><p>In birds, psittacosis causes a variety of symptoms, but it can also go unnoticed and lay dormant without signs. Birds that are acutely infected from exposure to the bacterium (which come in contact with an infected bird or item) will show symptoms after about three days, while carriers of the bacterium can become sick at any time. Infected birds are asymptomatic until they become stressed.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Puffy and Swollen Eyes </h3><p>Also known as conjunctivitis, puffy and swollen eyes is a common symptom in birds with psittacosis. This is due to inflammation that affects the blood vessels in and around the eye.</p><h3>Lethargy </h3><p>Lethargy is a symptom of many diseases that affect birds, humans, and other species. Various feelings of illness that your bird may endure throughout a case of psittacosis can cause its energy levels to lower, limiting normal behaviors like playing, vocalizing, and flying.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite and Weight Loss </h3><p>If you notice that your bird is not eating normal amounts of food, weight loss may follow. Talk to your exotic veterinarian about helping your bird maintain a healthy weight and consume vital nutrients when it's not feeling well.</p><h3>Fluffed Feathers </h3><p>Your bird may fluff its feathers to stay warm. Psittacosis commonly causes birds to feel cold and shiver, so fluffed feathers can be an indicator of this disease (although birds also fluff their feathers to demonstrate emotions like excitement, anxiety, anger, or happiness).</p><h3>Nasal Discharge </h3><p>Discharge from your bird's nasal cavity is common during cases of psittacosis. This may happen alongside respiratory issues like labored breathing.</p><h3>Abnormal Droppings </h3><p>Your bird's droppings can become runny, discolored, or otherwise abnormal for a variety of reasons. However, in combination with other symptoms of psittacosis, this may mean that its liver has been infected by the bacteria. Owners may notice discoloration of yellow or green varieties.</p><h2>Causes of Psittacosis </h2><p>Psittacosis is a highly contagious disease. Because it is able to spread through inhalation, it's common for psittacosis to infect more than one member of the same household (including birds, humans, and other animals).</p><p>The most commonly infected species of pet birds are those in the psittacine family (often referred to as parrots). These include macaws, budgerigars (parakeets), cockatiels, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, lorikeets, African grey parrots, lovebirds, and conures. Pet pigeons are also often infected with psittacosis, as are pet ducks. Hundreds of other species of birds are also susceptible to this disease, including wild birds. </p><h2>Diagnosing Psittacosis in Birds </h2><p>Since psittacosis symptoms can look like an array of other diseases in pet birds, special tests are needed to diagnose the presence of . In most cases, a blood test is best, as this can tell your veterinarian if the bird is infected even without the presence of symptoms. Histology (looking at tissues under the microscope), the detection of nucleic acids and antigens, various serological tests, and cultures may also be recommended by an avian vet to diagnose your bird with psittacosis. Sometimes more than one test is needed.</p><p>The bacterium can be detected in a number of bodily areas including the feces, liver, lungs, kidneys, spleen, excretions from the eyes, the choana, cloaca, and even the tissue that covers the heart called the pericardium. Birds that are experiencing symptoms of psittacosis are easier to diagnose than birds that are not showing any signs of the disease. Sometimes multiple fecal samples must be tested in order to find the bacterium, although fecal tests are not effective for diagnosis unless the bird is actively shedding the organism.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Thankfully, there is a treatment for psittacosis. Since birds cannot safely take the same kinds of antibiotics as other animals, your bird's veterinarian will likely prescribe doxycycline, an antibiotic in the tetracycline class of drugs, for 45 days to treat the disease through all stages. If your bird does not have , another type of antibiotic in the sulfonamide class may be successful as well, but this drug class does not have any effect on the most commonly diagnosed type of bacterium to cause psittacosis.</p><h2>Prognosis for Birds With Psittacosis </h2><p>About 50 percent of birds are said to die from psittacosis infections if left untreated, but antibiotics are usually successful in treating it. If your bird is presenting any of the symptoms associated with this disease, schedule an avian veterinary exam as soon as possible to begin treatment. Follow-up exams may be recommended to ensure the infection is cleared after 45 days of medication.</p><h2>How to Prevent Psittacosis </h2><p>Like other avian diseases, it's best for bird owners to try preventing infections of psittacosis before they occur.</p><h3>Cleanliness During Handling </h3><p>Certain disinfectants can kill the bacteria that causes psittacosis, so cleanliness is important in preventing this disease. If you attend a bird show or visit the pet store, make sure you wash your hands thoroughly between handling birds and before handling your own bird. Even items for sale at a pet store or bird show (such as food dishes, cages, and toys) can harbor fomites from infected birds and should be washed before being brought home to your bird.</p><h3>Sanitation Involving Wild Birds </h3><p>Wild birds can also carry psittacosis. Baby birds that fall out of the nest, dead birds, and injured birds are all commonly handled by humans and can carry psittacosis. If you handle wild birds (especially seabirds),be sure to wash your hands prior to handling your pet bird.</p><h3>Quarantining New Birds </h3><p>If you plan on adopting or purchasing a new pet bird, be sure to quarantine the bird prior to introducing them to another. This will allow time for you to monitor them for any signs of psittacosis. Be sure to practice good hygiene during this quarantine period or wear disposable gloves and a mask, especially if the source of the bird does not provide its medical history.</p><h3>Isolating Infected Birds </h3><p>If you have multiple birds and one is diagnosed with psittacosis, isolate that bird from the others immediately to minimize the risk of spreading the infection. Good ventilation, clean environments, and hand washing are all crucial to preventing the transmission of psittacosis at home.</p><h2>Is Psittacosis Contagious to Humans? </h2><p>Psittacosis is contagious to humans, and handling an infected bird can cause its owners to develop this disease. It can spread through inhalation, so being in close conditions with your bird is a risk. Try to increase ventilation in the room where your bird is kept by opening the windows and turning on fans. Always wear a mask and gloves when feeding or handling a diseased bird, and sanitize your home frequently.</p><p>The symptoms of psittacosis in humans and other mammals are different than those of birds. In humans, psittacosis typically causes respiratory disease, fever, chills, fatigue, muscle pain, dry cough, and more. In some mammals like cows and pigs, psittacosis can cause miscarriage and reproductive problems along with eye issues, lameness, fever, and nasal discharge.</p><p>Psittacosis can be fatal in untreated animals that show symptoms, but many are asymptomatic. Avariety of the symptoms can also indicate other kinds of diseases, so it is hard to diagnose psittacosis by looking at symptoms alone. Always tell your doctor about any possible exposures to infected animals to help them determine whether psittacosis is the cause of your symptoms.</p>",1389
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-of-egg-binding-in-birds-390494,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Egg-Binding In Birds</h1>,"<h1>Egg-Binding In Birds</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Egg-binding is a serious and sometimes fatal condition that affects female birds of breeding age. It can affect any bird, but among common pet birds, it is most often seen in smaller species including finches, parakeets, lovebirds, canaries, and cockatiels.</p><p>Basically, egg-binding means that the egg has become ""stuck,"" and the bird is unable to expel it from its body within a normal time frame, which depending on species, can be anywhere from 24 to 48 hours. This causes the bird to strain in an attempt to pass the egg, which owners sometimes mistake as the bird straining to defecate. Your bird will likely appear ill, lose its appetite, fluff up its feathers, sleep more than normal, and may have a swollen abdomen. The stuck egg may make it difficult for your bird to pass feces and urine, as well.</p><p>Since it's so important for egg-bound hens to receive prompt medical treatment, owners should know what signs and symptoms to watch for in their pets. If left untreated, your bird can become critically ill and may die.</p><h2>What Is Egg-Binding? </h2><p>Many bird owners are surprised to learn that a female bird that has no contact with a male can still lay eggs. These eggs are not fertilized, so can not produce a viable chick, however. While not every pet female bird will lay eggs, the possibility is there for all of them.</p><p>Egg-binding occurs when an egg takes longer than usual to pass out of the reproductive tract. While the normal length of time to pass an egg varies between bird species, and even between individual birds, most birds pass an egg within 24 to 48 hours. Your bird might lay just one egg, or several eggs. It is possible for a bird to lay an egg normally, but then experience egg-binding with subsequent eggs.</p><p>The egg can become stuck inside the bird's vent, which is the opening for expelling materials from the urinary, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. In this case, you might actually see a bit of the egg bulging through the vent.</p><p>Eggs can also bind higher up the reproductive tract. An egg may become stuck in the oviduct, which is the tube that leads from the ovaries to the vent, or within the cloaca, which is a chamber just within the vent that collects materials from the urinary, gastrointestinal, and reproductive tracts. Unlike mammals, birds have just one common opening/exit for these three organ systems.</p><h2>Symptoms of Egg-Binding in Birds </h2><p>Birds can hide symptoms of illness until the condition becomes too advanced to hide any longer. This helps wild birds survive, as a weak bird is an easy target for a predator but can make it difficult for a pet owner to realize their bird is ill. Recognizing the signs of egg-binding early on is key to your pet's survival. If you observe any of the following symptoms, contact an avian veterinarian as soon as possible. The vet can properly diagnose your pet's problem and get it on the road to a fast recovery.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Rapid or Labored Breathing </h3><p>Many egg-bound hens look like they are having a hard time breathing, particularly after exertion, such as flying or fluttering within their cage. Even slightly labored breathing is a symptom of egg-binding.</p><h3>Swelling </h3><p>An egg-bound hen may appear to have a swollen abdomen or show swelling around its vent from straining to pass an egg. Birds with swelling on any part of their bodies should be seen by a medical professional as soon as possible.</p><h3>Constipation </h3><p>If you suspect that a hen may be egg-bound, watch its droppings. You should assume there's a problem if they look abnormal or if it fails to produce any at all.</p><h3>Fluffed-Up Feathers </h3><p>One of the most common symptoms of illness in birds, fluffed-up feathers can also be a sign that a bird is egg-bound. If you observe your bird sitting with its feathers fluffed up, assess it for any other symptoms or abnormalities.</p><h3>Straining </h3><p>Egg-bound hens often visibly strain to try and pass their eggs. Egg-binding should be suspected in birds that strain but show no progress in moving their eggs.</p><h3>Sitting on the Cage Floor </h3><p>Most of the time, birds that are egg-bound tend to sit on the cage floor. Eggs that are stuck inside of a hen can put immense pressure on the bird's spine, sometimes causing paralysis and the inability to perch.</p><h3>Lameness </h3><p>If the stuck egg puts pressure internally on the nerves that go into the bird's legs, it can cause lameness or even an inability to stand.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite </h3><p>This is a common symptom of several illnesses, but if you notice your bird is not eating, assess it for other signs of egg-binding.</p><h3>Sudden Death </h3><p>Unfortunately, in some cases, the first and only sign that a bird is suffering from egg-binding is the sudden death of the bird.</p><h2>Causes of Egg-Binding </h2><p>There are several causes of egg-binding. The most common have to do with the egg itself, the bird's diet, or issues with the hen's reproductive tract.</p><p>Sometimes, the egg itself is too large for the hen to pass easily, or is positioned incorrectly inside the reproductive system, making it impossible for the bird to lay the egg normally.</p><p>Dietary issues are a common cause of egg-binding, particularly with birds that are deficient in calcium. Lack of calcium can cause eggshells that are weak or partially formed, and more prone to becoming stuck. Also, calcium, vitamin E, and vitamin D help the uterine and oviduct muscles contract forcefully enough to move the egg through and out of the hen's reproductive system. Obese birds are also at higher risk of egg-binding.</p><p>Infections, tumors, or inflammation within the hen's reproductive system can cause swelling that leads to egg-binding.</p><h2>Diagnosing Egg-Binding in Birds </h2><p>Often, your avian veterinarian can diagnose egg-binding just by gently feeling the hen's abdomen, as it is often possible to feel the stuck egg inside. However, most vets will take x-rays of the bird, which allows them to see the exact size and position of the stuck egg. Occasionally, an egg becomes stuck before the shell is fully formed, making it difficult to see on an x-ray. If your vet suspects this is the case, they might choose to do an ultrasound, which will show even a shell-less egg.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>A bird suffering from egg-binding should be seen by a veterinarian right away, as the longer you wait, the less likely the bird is to survive. Once at the vet's office, if the bird is determined to be critically ill, it will be treated for shock. This usually includes warming the bird, giving fluids and calcium via an IV into a vein, and sometimes providing supplemental oxygen. In some cases, these measures are enough to allow the bird to pass the egg on its own.</p><p>If the egg doesn't pass, the veterinarian will assess its position inside the hen. If the egg is inside the cloaca, it sometimes can be massaged out or extracted with lubricated cotton swabs.</p><p>If the massage and natural methods don't extract the egg, it may be necessary to break the egg while it is still within the hen and remove it in parts. If this occurs, the vet will use a needle to remove the contents of the egg, which will cause the egg to collapse. The vet will then clean the hen's oviduct to remove any shell fragments or egg residue. Leaving anything in the hen could lead to infection or internal tissue damage.</p><h2>Prognosis </h2><p>With prompt treatment, most birds will survive. However, if the stuck egg causes the hen to be unable to easily breathe or expel waste, and the bird isn't provided emergency treatment, the prognosis is poorer.</p><h2>How to Prevent Egg-Binding </h2><p>Since egg-binding is a common condition, it is hard to completely prevent it. It's best to maintain a healthy lifestyle for your hen. Feeding a well-balanced diet that includes enough calcium is crucial, as is preventing your bird from becoming overweight. Your bird should have opportunities for exercise and play each day.</p><p>However, birds that tend to lay eggs frequently and have experienced egg-binding may be prone to more episodes of this serious condition. In that case, your vet might recommend hormone injections at the beginning of egg-laying season to prevent your bird from laying an egg.</p><p>Keeping daily watch on your hens will help you know their habits and be better aware if they are displaying any symptoms of egg-binding.</p>",1410
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-why-owl-not-good-pet-4007846,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>6 Reasons Why Owls Make Bad Pets</h1>,"<h1>6 Reasons Why Owls Make Bad Pets</h1><p>Owls are wild creatures and keeping one in a typical home setting is nearly impossible. They donot putup with cuddling andfrequent contact with humans because it is entirely against their evolved nature. These razor-sharp talons are designed for piercing and cutting, not perching on your shoulder. This is a bird that evolution has designed to hunt and kill small prey, not entertain human owners in ahomeenvironment.</p><p>There are at least six unavoidable reasons why an owl is a very poor choice for a pet.</p><h3>Watch Now: Do Owls Make Good Pets?</h3><h2>Owls Are Carnivores </h2><p>If you keep an owl, you'll be feeding it fresh meat on a daily basis. Owls are strictly meat eaters and feeding an animal raw meat is not a pleasanttask. Although most wild carnivores kept in captivity are fed stored frozen meats that are thawed out, doing this every day and dealing with the blood and leftovers is not for the faint of heart. And this is not a creature who will eat hamburgers or steakowls eat only whole animals, such as rodents, that must be purchased from commercial sources. Not many people really enjoy storing rats and guinea pigsnext to the family's frozen foods in the freezer.</p><p>And owls are notoriously messy eaters. The eating process is to tear prey to shreds in order to eat small bites, and this mess must be cleaned up after each feeding. Owls hunt small rodents in the wild using their hearing and sight. Many owls have ear holes spaces at different heights on their heads, allowing the brain to create a three-dimensional audio map of their surroundings. An owl in a domestic environment will simulate that hunting instinct and eat violently, even in your home. The instinct to sink sharp talons into any source of foodincluding a human hand-delivering the mealmakes an owl dangerous to anyone who is not experienced and skilled.</p><h2>Owls Need Space </h2><p>Owls need a lot of space. A parrot cage in the corner of the living room is just not sufficient. A substantial aviary setting will be necessary, and it will need to be made of sturdy wire since the owl'ssharp talons will turn a wood enclosure into toothpicks in short order. Remember this if you manage to slightly tame an owl and let it fly around your houseyour furniture doesn't stand a chance.</p><p>Owls need to bathe regularly due to the dust and dirt that accumulateson the feathers. This instinct offers the bird advantage as a hunter since soiled wings cause feathers to whistle while the bird is in flight, betraying the owl's presence to prey animals. The instinct to bathe keeps the owl's feathers clean and silent. When kept in captivity, owls need a large bath pan that is cleaned and refilled regularly. (Owls bathe during the day, which poses some problems for owls in the wild. Swifter raptors such as goshawks are dayhunters. Goshawkspose the biggest danger to owls, who often fall prey to them while bathing.)</p><p>Ideally, owls kept in domestic settings are best off in outdoor aviaries. This largely defeats the purpose of keeping a pet bird at all, since it is hard to bond with a bird that never comes indoors and is kept in alarge outdoor aviary, where the best you can hope for is to visit it once or twice a day. Despite this, owls become habituated to human presence and will become stressed if they are ignored. When you do interact with your owl, though, it will be mostly for the chores of feeding it or cleaning up after it. This is no warm and fuzzy pet, but one that demands a lot without offering much in return.</p><h2>Owls Require a Permit </h2><p>Owls are wildlife species, and you will need to be trained before you get a license to keep a native species in captivity. Only after being trained and licensed can you legally keep an owl. And even this licensing by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS)does not allow you to turn an owl into a domestic petonly to serve as a rehab specialist. According to regulations, once an owl is healthy and fit, it must be released back to the wild.</p><p>An owl with a permanent disability is not a suitable ""pet,"" either. If an owl has an injury that prevents its release, you must also have an education permit, which is going to keep you extremely busy. This educational permit compels you to do educational programs for the publica certain number each year. The education requirements vary from state to state, but you must meet these minimum requirements in order to maintain the permit. Finally, there are only a limited number of injuries that allow a raptor to qualify as an educational bird.</p><p>In other words, the licensing and educational permit restrictions are very strict, making it very difficult to legally keep a raptor in a home environment. A ""pet"" owl is usually one being kept illegally.</p><p>Except in special circumstances, keeping wild owls is against the law in the US, but this is not the case in other nations. In the UK, for example, keeping wild owls is allowed. However, the Harry Potter-inspired upsurge in owl ownershipwas quickly followed by birds being given up. Families were simply not up to the demands of keeping an owl in captivity.</p><h2>Owls Are Nocturnal </h2><p>Owls are nocturnal, which means they are active and hunt during the darkness of night. Unlike otherbirds, owls make their noise at night, especially during mating season. Domestic parrots, while they can be very noisy at certain times of day, tend to be silent in the dark hours of the night, and thus do not disturb neighbors. But owls socialize and mate noisily, and are instinctively at their noisiest during the dark hours when neighbors can be most bothered. A great horned owlin an outdoor aviary that hoots all night, every night, through the entire month of October will not make you popular with your neighbors.</p><h2>Owls Need Constant Care </h2><p>All pets demand attention from their owners, but normally, it's not too hard to find a boarding facility or pet-sitter when you need to travel or want to vacation without your pet. But an owl is not a pet that lends itself to just any pet-sitter. It's not easy to find a caretaker willing to thaw out frozen rodents, feed them to a lethal owl, then clean up the bloody mess.</p><p>Keeping an owl will greatly curtail your travel options. Be ready to stay at home if you insist on owning one.</p><h2>Owls Are Messy </h2><p>Well, you're in for a treat. Owls poop. They poop a lot. They poop everywhere. And unlike parrots who are primarily vegetable eaters, owl poop contains the waste of digested meat, and it smells. And owls also regurgitatepellets containing the undigested bits of bones andfeathers of the animal carcasses they have just eaten.</p><p>All birds are messy creatures, but owls are among the messiest of all. Keeping an owl means you will frequently cleanup excrement, regurgitated pellets, feathers, and all the other detritus left on the floor of your huge aviary. Keeping an owl makes owning a large parrot seem carefree by comparison.</p><h2>The Bottom Line </h2><p>Any number of experts confirm that an owl is not a species well suited as a pet. When asked about an owl's suitability as a pet, raptor handler Tamara Barker-Hanley replied: ""Owls make lousy pets because they are wild animals. They are a federally protected species under the migratory bird act, and they will inflict major injury if not handled correctly.""</p><p>Steve Malowski, Team Leader for the bird department at the Cincinnati Zoo, notes that private persons are unlikely to qualify for permits to keep an owl. ""I would leave it to the experts and ignore all the cutesy videos of owls supposedly as pets. Europe and elsewhere may be different but USFWS (United States Fish and Wildlife Service) is very strict.""</p><p>And finally, a few words from Joe Krathwohl, ""The Bird Man of Las Vegas:""</p><p>Owls are fascinating raptors that deserve your admiration and interest.But if you like owls, it is best to sponsor one by making a cash donation at a rehab centernear you. You can visit and see ""your"" bird when it's convenient, and leave the care and the feeding to the experts who know what they are doing.</p>",1380

They are busybodies that like to be in the midst of the action. Of the seven species of lorikeet that reside in Australia, the rainbow lorikeet is most commonly known.</p><h3>What is a lorikeet?</h3><p>Part of the  family of birds, a lorikeet is a type of parrot that is native to Australia and New Guinea. There are about 53 species of lorikeets, and these colorful birds are known for their vibrant feathers and talkative personalities.</p><p>Like a young puppy, this bird encourages play whenever its favorite person is around. This bird is not shy and will let you know when it needs attention. If you're looking for a laid-back bird, this may not be the right bird for you.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Rainbow lorikeet, lory, rainbow bird</p><p>Scientific Name: (Subspecies: Swainson's Lorikeet , the Lake Eyre Lorikeet , and the Northern Moluccan Lorikeet </p><p>Adult Size: Up to 15 inches in length and 2.5 to 5.5 ounces in weight</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The rainbow lorikeet is native to coastal regions from northern Queensland to Southern Australian along the eastern coastline. Colonies of rainbow lorikeets have since established in Perth in western Australia, Tasmania, New Zealand, and Hong Kong. The rainbow lorikeet lives in the trees of the rainforest, the bush, and the woodlands. Rainbow lorikeets can fly up to 40 miles in a day to find food. They often fly in noisy flocks of one or two dozen birds.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Rainbow lorikeets are sweet, affectionate birds that are known for their comical antics and friendly personalities. In general, these birds are friendly, easy to socialize, and value interaction with their human keepers.</p><p>Hand-feed these young birds during their training. They will become acclimated to human touch and may be less nippy.</p><p>This bird is a highly intelligent bird that can learn tricks and other behaviors. Because it's so smart, it is also a capable escape artist. Cage door locks are a must.</p><p>Most lories get along well with other bird species, but they can be very territorial and can become quite jealous. They can become vicious with birds of their species and should never be left unsupervised with other birds.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Rainbow lorikeets are excellent talkers, and they can learn to say many words and phrases. They are noisy birds and have a high-pitched tone with frequent squawks. Their sometimes shrill vocaizations can be abrasive and unpleasant to some people.This bird is not the ideal pet for people who have close neighbors who are sensitive to loud sounds.</p><h2>Rainbow Lorikeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>They are one of the most colorful species kept as companion birds.They have a slender build similar to Asiatic parakeets, such as the Indian ringneck parakeet or Alexandrine parakeet.</p><p>Rainbow lorikeets certainly live up to their nametheir faces and bellies sport a deep blue plumage with green feathers on their wings, backs, and heads. They have bright red breasts with highlights of yellow and orange on the sides. Their bright red beaks offset against the blue of their facial feathers, and they have dark, grayish-black skin on their feet.</p><p>You cannot tell males and females apart by appearance. To determine sex, the bird needs genetic testing or a surgical sexing procedure.</p><h2>Caring for a Rainbow Lorikeet </h2><p>Overall, rainbow lorikeets are excellent pets for those who have plenty of free time to spend with them. Rainbow lorikeets love to play and need to be provided with plenty of toys to keep their minds and beaks busy.</p><p>These birds need a large flight cage or aviary. The minimum size for a cage should 4 feet long by 2 feet wide and 3 feet tall. The cage should be sturdy, metal constructionsteer clear of wooden cages, which can be torn apart by their beaks.</p><p>While cleaning up after any pet bird can be quite a mess, lorikeets can get messy due to their liquid-based diets. When choosing a location for a lorikeet's cage, it's essential to place the cage in an area where there is no carpet and where the floors and walls can be easily wiped clean. Many people line their walls with plastic sheeting to protect their walls due to the bird droppings. This smart species can be potty trained to control where the bird does its toileting.</p><p>Since a lorikeet's diet consists mainly of sugary nectars that are prone to bacterial growth, clean their food cups within two hours of feeding to prevent bacterial infections.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Rainbow lorikeets are susceptible to lorikeet paralysis syndrome, a condition in which birds are unable to move their body, wings, legs, or head.They also lose their ability to swallow or blink.The exact cause is unknown, but a viral infection or vitamin deficiency may be the culprit.</p><p>Most intelligent bird species are prone to feather plucking when a bird becomes bored, feels neglected, or gets anxious. Although lorikeets are not primarily known for feather plucking, rainbow lorikeets can get depressed if they do not get sufficient mental and physical exercise.</p><p>Another condition, sour crop, is a bacterial infection that affects the bird's crop or food storage pouch in the throat area of the bird's digestive tract. You can avoid this problem with meticulous cleaning of the bird's cage, food cups, and water cups between feedings.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Unlike other parrots, lories survive in the wild mainly on nectar and flower pollen. If you look inside of a lorikeet's mouth, you'll notice that their tongues have uniquely adapted ""brushes"" on the tips to help them harvest these foods from the plants in their environment.</p><p>In captivity, lorikeet owners feed their pets either commercially available or homemade nectar mixes, which must be prepared fresh two to three times daily. Start by offering 1/4 cup per feedinggive more if they finish quickly and are looking for more. These birds are usually eating for at least three hours throughout the day.</p><p>Supplement a pet lorikeet's diet with treats like oats, fresh fruit, edible organic flowers, and green vegetables twice daily. Avoid citrus fruits; they may upset the bird's digestion. Discard any uneaten food after three to four hours. Provide fresh water every day.</p><p>Do not feed this bird a seed or pellet mix. These hard foods can damage this bird's delicate brush-like tongue. Also, avoid foods like avocado, chocolate, coffee, rhubarb, and alcohol; they are toxic to all birds.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Rainbow lorikeets are very active birds, so they require plenty of exercise to maintain optimal health. A lorikeet needs a large cage so that they have room to climb and fly. This bird needs a minimum of 3 to 4 daily hours of supervised, out-of-cage playtime for good physical and emotional health.</p><p>Rainbow lorikeets love to play and need to be provided with plenty of toys to keep their minds and beaks busy. They are avid chewers, stock up on destructible toys made of safe woods so that they can exercise their beaks.</p><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Intelligent, can learn to speak</p><p>Can teach tricks, including potty training</p><p>Can be loud, not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Requires specialized nectar diet</p><p>Territorial, might not get along with other birds</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Rainbow Lorikeet </h2><p>Look into local lorikeet breeders and make an appointment to meet with them and their birds to see if you think you could handle day-to-day living with a lorikeet in your household. They can cost from $500 to $1,500.</p><p>A healthy lorikeet will be bright and active with smooth feathers.Make sure that the beak is clean, the eyes clear and bright, and that there are no broken feathers.Feet should be clean, and nails should not be too long.</p>",1274
5,https://www.thesprucepets.com/parrot-nutrition-1236730,Birds > Pet Bird Nutrition & Food,<h1>Parrot Nutrition 101</h1>,"<h1>Parrot Nutrition 101</h1><p>An imbalanced or incomplete diet is a common problem with pet birds and is a relatively common cause of illness. There is a lack of scientific study on avian nutrition, especially as it relates to the different species. While our avian nutrition is still in the early stages, most experts agree that a good diet for parrots begins with a formulated diet with a variety of other foods added as supplements.</p><h2>Seeds </h2><p>For most pet birds, especially parrots and parakeets, a diet based primarily on seeds is deficient in many nutrients, including vitamin A and calcium, and is too high in fat. This is not to say that seed does not have a place in avian diets, but many birds come to prefer them to the exclusion of other healthy choices and can be fussy when it comes to trying a varied diet. Some birds will even pick out a couple of favorites from a seed mix, which further reduces the nutritional balance in the diet. When it comes to parrot nutrition, consider seeds to be like junk food: birds love them, but they are not the healthiest choice. For most species of parrot, seeds should be strictly limited if not completely eliminated from from your bird's diet. A diet high in seeds will increase the risk of high cholesterol, heart problems, obesity and fatty liver disease. Some species, like budgies and cockatiels, are naturally seed eaters and can tolerate a higher percentage of seed in the diet, but even for these birds, seeds should only make up about 25 percent of the diet.</p><h2>Formulated Diets </h2><p>A number of years ago, realizing that many parrots were suffering from nutritional deficiencies, companies began producing pelleted diets for pet birds. These are made from a variety of foods including grains, seeds, vegetables, fruits, fortified with vitamins and minerals, and are baked into pellet or variety of other extruded shapes. These provide a balanced nutritious diet and prevent birds from picking out their favorite food items and leaving the rest. However, many birds, especially those started on a seed-based diet, do not readily take to eating a formulated diet. As well, formulated diets, though well balanced, do not provide the variety and stimulation that many pet birds crave in their diets (after all, eating the same thing day after would be boring for anyone). Therefore, a pelleted diet should comprise 50 to 75 percent of what the bird eats, and 25 to 50 percent should be fresh vegetables, while fruit can be 5%.</p><p>Some good brands of formulated diets include Harrison's, Zupreem, Kaytee, Pretty Bird, and Roudybush. As these diets grow in acceptance and popularity, manufacturers are producing lines formulated for particular species and also for health management (e.g. lower-calorie diets for weight management). As mentioned earlier, these diets come in a variety of shapes from larger chunks down to crumbles, and you may need to experiment to find the type your bird prefers. Some birds, especially those used to a seed-based diet, may be difficult to switch to a formulated diet. Zupreem has great resources on different ways to convert your parrots diet over to pellets!</p><p>As we come to a better understanding of the nutritional needs of birds, the recommended diet for pet parrots includes a variety of nutritious freshly prepared foods in addition to a formulated diet (pellets) and a small percentage of seeds/nuts. Remember that most freshly prepared foods will spoil readily, and should be removed from the cage after a couple of hours. If your bird is not readily accepting new foods, try offering them early in the morning or in the evening, times when birds naturally forage for food in the wild.</p><h2>Vegetables </h2><p>Fresh vegetables are a great addition to your bird's diet. Not all vegetables are equally nutritious though; vegetables like celery and lettuce are high in fiber and water but are otherwise not all that nutritious. Dark yellow and leafy green vegetables are usually excellent choices. You can offer vegetables in a variety of forms to entice the bird to try themfresh whole or chopped, or cooked and fed slightly warm. Try hanging vegetables from the side of the cage in a clip, or offering them in chunks that larger birds can pick up with their feet to gnaw on. You may need to be creative to get them to try things and the aim is to get your bird to eat as many different kinds of vegetables as possible.</p><p>Remember,noavocado!</p><h2>Fruits </h2><p>Again, you want to feed a wide variety, not just a favored few. Many birds love fruit and will overdo it so limit fruits to a fairly small portion of the overall diet. As with vegetables, many of the more deeply colored fruits contain more nutrition, and it is good to try feeding a variety of more tropical types of fruits parrots might be exposed to in their native habitats. However, make sure they do not eat pits or apple seeds as these can be toxic.</p><h2>Other Foods </h2><p>Birds can also be fed a variety of nutritious grains, such as cooked brown rice, quinoa, oats, wheat, barley, and pasta. Whole wheat bread and unsweetened whole wheat cereals can also be offered. Cooked legumes such as beans, lentils, and peas are an excellent addition to their diets. Birds can also be offered small amounts of cooked eggs.</p><h2>Sprouted Seeds </h2><p>Sprouted seeds are an excellent source of nutrition for pet birds and an excellent way to supplement with greens. Freshly sprouted seeds are a nutritional gold mine, as the seed mobilizes its nutritional content into a highly digestible and bioavailable form as it starts to grow. Sprouted seeds are rich in vitamins and minerals as well as enzymes and antioxidants, and some consider them to be nature's most perfect food. In any case, they are an excellent way to provide a nutritional boost and most birds love them. Be sure to thoroughly wash them prior to feeding them to your parrot due to bacteria that can cling to the plant!</p><h2>Vitamin and Mineral Supplements </h2><p>It is usually a good idea to offer a cuttlebone (for extra calcium) but otherwise, extra vitamin and mineral supplements are not needed if you are feeding a well-balanced diet based on formulated foods supplemented with a variety of nutrition home-prepared foods. Additional supplements should only be given on the advice of your veterinarian.</p><h2>Foods to Avoid </h2><p>Stay away from junk foods and any foods high in fat, salt, or sugar. Birds are also lactose intolerant, so don't feed milk products.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Chocolate, avocado, and rhubarb are toxic to birds. Of course, do not give any beverages containing caffeine or alcohol. Avoid processed meats or other foods high in nitrates, nitrites, sulfites, or monosodium glutamate (MSG). Onions, garlic, sprouted lima, fava and navy beans, fruit pits and apple seeds should also be avoided.</p><p>Some experts and owners are concerned about feeding peanuts in the shell because they can be contaminated with Aspergillus fungus, which can cause respiratory illness as well as producing a toxin (aflatoxin, a potent carcinogen). If you feed raw peanuts, which should be in very small quantities in the birds diet, get good quality human grade peanuts and do not feed if there is any sign of mold. Shelled, blanched (unsalted, of course) peanut are fine. All food should be inspected and discarded if there are any signs of mold.</p><p>Nutritional Diseases of Pet Birds.</p>",1245
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-chickens-1238426,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chicken</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pet Chicken</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Some might view chickens as strictly farm animals. But it's relatively common for homes in the suburbs and cities to have pet chickens as well, as long as local ordinances permit them. There are many chicken breeds to choose from, including Silkies, Rhode Island Reds, Easter Eggers, and Brahmas. The breeds range in coloring and size.Chickens make for fairly quiet and low-maintenance pets. They do need some space for their housing, but their diet is pretty straightforward. And they typically offer you fresh eggs in return for your care. </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Chicken</p><p>Adult Size: Up to roughly 2 feet in length (varies by breed)</p><p>Lifespan: 5 to 10 years on average (varies by breed)</p><h2>Chicken Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Chickens are social flock animals, so you will need to get more than one. They can learn to be comfortable around humans, especially if they're gently handled from a young age. Many come to enjoy petting and being around the people who care for them. Some are comfortable with being picked up while others prefer not to be contained.</p><p>They typically aren't aggressive but might peck or scratch if they feel threatened or uncomfortable.Moreover, because they are prey animals, they typically should be kept away from other household pets, such as dogs and cats, that can cause undue stress or injury.</p><p>Expect to spend at least a couple hours per day with your chickens on feeding, cleaning, and interaction. They are largely quiet pets, though they do make several soft vocalizations.</p><h2>Size Information </h2><p>The size of chickens can widely vary by breed. In general, they are less than 2 feet long and weigh around 5 pounds on average.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Chickens need space to roam and cannot be housebroken. This is why people commonly keep them in outdoor coops (small structures with solid walls and a roof) with attached runs (secure areas that allow chickens access to grass and dirt where they can forage). It's recommended to have at least 3 to 5 square feet of space per chicken.</p><p>Coops should be insulated from extreme weather but still have ventilation. And both coops and runs must have protection from predators. Fencing and walls must be free of holes that predators could access, and fencing should be buried down into the ground to prevent predators from digging under it. Chicken runs also should have roofs made of wire or netting to protect from hawks and other predators.</p><p>Inside the coop, there should be a roosting spot off the ground, as well as at least one nest box per every four hens. Depending on your climate, you might need a heat lamp in cold weather.Also, always have feeders and waterers accessible.</p><h3>Specific Substrate Needs </h3><p>On the floor of the coop, add a couple inches of straw for bedding. This will cushion the floor and add some warm in the winter. Spot-check your chickens' enclosure on a daily basis. And roughly once a month, remove all the bedding in the coop, scrub the floor and walls, wait for it to dry, and then add fresh bedding.</p><h2>What Do Chickens Eat & Drink? </h2><p>Chickens are omnivores, meaning they eat both plants and animals. In general, that consists of grains, fruits, veggies, herbs, and insects.</p><p>Offer a balanced commercial chicken feed to meet your chickens' nutritional needs. Consult your vet for the proper amount, as this can vary based on age and other factors. Chickens tend to graze throughout the day, so most owners add a daily serving each morning to a specialized hopper feeder that goes in the enclosure. Feed should always be available.</p><p>You also can offer a variety of fruits and vegetablesas well as a limited amount of grains, such as cracked corn and oatseach day. Again, discuss the proper feeding amounts with your vet. Fresh foods should go in a separate feeding dish from the pelleted diet.</p><p>Finally, make sure your chickens always have access to clean water. There are waterers similar to the feeders that go on the floor of your chickens' enclosure. You also can use a water trough. Refresh the water daily. </p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><h3>Tip</h3><p>Not all veterinarians accept chickens as patients. So before acquiring any, make sure there is a vet near you who can treat them.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Sufficient exercise is important to keep chickens in good body condition for egg laying and to generally prevent health issues, such as obesity. As long as you provide your chickens with a large enough space to roam and don't overcrowd them, they should get the exercise they need. There also are chicken toys, such as treat dispensers, that can get your pets up and moving.</p><h2>Grooming </h2><p>Chickens mostly groom themselves via preening and what's known as a dust bath. Dust baths help to absorb excess oils on a chicken's feathers and skin, and they can dislodge debris and even parasites.Furthermore, some chickens might not naturally wear down their nails enough and occasionally require you or a vet to trim them. A vet can typically teach you how to do this at home if you're willing.</p><h2>Upkeep Costs </h2><p>Your primary ongoing costs for chickens will be their food and bedding. Expect to pay around $15 to $30 per chicken each month. You'll also occasionally have to replace worn items in the coop, costing around $10 to $30 on average. Plus, make sure to budget for routine veterinary checkups and emergency care.</p><h2>Pros & Cons of Keeping a Chicken as a Pet </h2><p>Chickens can make for fairly low-maintenance and quiet pets. Plus, they'll typically provide you with an abundance of eggs, and you'll have the benefit of knowing the eggs are coming from a well-treated animal. However, chickens do need a specialized housing setup and some space to roam. And they must be protected from predators and the elements.</p><h2>Similar Exotic Pets to the Chicken </h2><p>Otherwise, check out other exotic animals that can be your new pet.</p><h2>Purchasing or Adopting Your Chicken </h2><p>You can find chickens via reputable breeders and rescue groups. Sometimes even traditional animal shelters have chickens for adoption. Expect to pay around $10 to $30 on average, though this can vary depending on factors such as the animal's age and breed.</p><h3>Reproduction/Breeding </h3><p>Local exotic animal veterinarians might be able to direct you to a good chicken breeder or rescue group. Check with area farm animal sanctuaries as well. The main benefit of going to a breeder is you'll typically have a wider selection of various breeds and younger animals. Rescues often take in chickens from factory farms that otherwise would be slaughtered.</p><p>Chickens can't always be properly sexed when they're young. So to ensure you're getting a female bird, you might want to opt for an older chicken. That way, you won't have any unwanted breeding or other issues with having roosters. </p><p>Chickens can be good pets for children who are able to be gentle around them.</p><p>Chickens are fairly easy to maintain once you get their housing set up, requiring daily feedings and regular cleanings.</p><p>Some chickens can learn to be comfortable with handling when tamed from a young age. But in general they are not cuddly pets.</p><p>Raising Chickens for Eggs.</p><p>Raising Chickens for Eggs.</p>",1179
7,https://www.thesprucepets.com/budgies-1236736,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Small Bird Breeds,<h1>A Complete Guide to Keeping a Pet Parakeet</h1>,"<h1>A Complete Guide to Keeping a Pet Parakeet</h1><p>The budgie, or parakeet, is among the smallest of the parrot species commonly kept as pets. They are also one of the most popular pet birds in the world, due in part to the fact that they are quite affordable. Thesesmall parrotsare exceedingly friendly and easy to tame.</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The budgie and other parakeet species are native to Australia, where they are still found in huge flocks in grasslands. These wild species, however, are slightly smaller than the birds normally found in pet stores, which have now undergone decades of captive breeding.</p><p>The EnglishnaturalistJohn Gould brought the budgie to Europe around 1840, where they quickly became favorites as pets. By 1894, Australia banned export budgies, leading to a lucrative breeding business in Europe. The bird was slow to find its way to America,arriving about 1920, but became wildly popular by the 1950s.</p><p>There are two types of budgies common to the pet tradethe American budgie or parakeet and theEnglishbudgie. The American variety is the one most commonly found in pet stores, while the type often seen in exhibitions and shows is the larger English budgie. English budgies have a different appearance than American budgies, but both types belong to the same species.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Budgies are gentle and docile birds. They are also very easy to tame, especially if acquired at a young age.Pairs of birds make good company for each other, but when in living pairs and entertaining one another, they may not bond as well with their owners or mimic speech as fluently.Budgies are also very playful, active, and quieter than some other types of parrots.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>While they can sometimes be difficult to understand, parakeets are also quite capable of mimicking human speech.They aren't the easiest birds to teach to speak, but you can likely teach them a few easy words. In addition to the ability to mimic human speech, parakeets are quite gifted at mimicking other sounds. A creaking door, a squeaking chair, the tone of a text message coming into a phoneheard enough times, your parakeet will start making these sounds, too.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The normal wild coloration of a budgie is a light green with black bars on its wings, back, and head. Typically mature females have a tan or beige cere (the fleshy part around the nostrils), and the males have a bluish cere. Young budgies also have bar markings on their foreheads that recede with age, and their eyes typically have dark irises that gradually become gray with age. Through selective breeding in the pet trade, a huge variety of colors and patterns are available, including violet, blue, yellow, pied, albino, and the classic neon green.</p><h2>Caring for Parakeets </h2><p> Budgies are active and playful and should have a large cage that allows room for toys, sleeping, eating, andflight. Minimum dimensions for a cage are 20 inches long by 12 inches deep by 18 inches high, but bigger is always better. The spacing of the cage bars should be half an inch or less to avoid escapes and to prevent your bird from getting stuck. Horizontal cage bars offer the best opportunity for climbing and exercise. Place at least a couple of perches at different levels, with enough space for your budgie to comfortably move between them. Offering a variety of perch sizes, shapes, and textures will also help keep your budgie's feet in good shape. A nest to sleep in, dishes for food and water, various toys, and things to chew on should all fit inside the cage.</p><p>Even if they have a large cage, budgies will still need playtime and socialization opportunities outside of the cage. Flight is very natural and important for a bird, but you should only allow your budgie to fly in a very secure and safe area. If you have concerns about being able to control your bird's flight area,consider having the wings trimmed some to decrease the flying abilities.</p><p>Like most parrots, budgies are social birds, and thus many owners keep budgies in pairs so that they can entertain one another. Budgies seem to be happiest when kept in pairs. A single bird can be fine as long as you are able to spend a significant amount of time interacting with them on a daily basis.</p><h2>Common Health Issues </h2><p> Budgies are prone to some of the same issues as other parrots, but also have some that are unique to this species. They can be susceptible to goiters caused by iodine deficiency or develop tumors if their diet includes too many seeds and not enough fruits and vegetables. Budgies can also be subject to (also called , caused by bacteria), and they can fall prey to scaly mites that affect the skin on the legs and around the eyes.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Variety is the key to a healthy diet for your budgie since these birds are diverse foragers in the wild.Seeds can be a nutritious part of a budgie's diet, but because these are high in fat, seedsshould only make up a portion of the diet.Pelleted dietsare often a good choice for birds, as they are nutritionally balanced. Seeds and pellets can be fed in combination, but other foods should also complement the diet, including a variety of fresh vegetables (carrots, broccoli, corn, spinach, beans, etc.) and fruit.</p><p>Have patience with your budgie anytime you introduce a new food, as they can be scary to birds.Sprouted seeds are also an excellent way to add variety to your bird's diet, but avocados, chocolate, sugar, and salt must be avoided.</p><p>A cuttlebone can be provided as a source of calcium.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Free flying time is criticalto the budgie;try to offer several hours each a day in a room that is safe. A large houseplant can be a great playground. Your budgie needs a variety of toys to offer exercise and mental stimulation. It's best to rotate the toys every month or so to prevent them from growing bored.</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Parakeet </h2><p>Unlike other parrots, budgies are widely available at nearly all pet stores, so care is necessary when selecting a bird. Where possible, it's better to buy a bird directly from a breeder. It is best to choose a young budgie that has been handled regularly if you want to tame your budgie easily. You can expect to pay more for a hand-reared or very young bird, but it may be worth the extra cost since it will make the hand-taming process quicker and easier. Pet stores typically have older birds, so hand-taming them may be more of a challenge.</p><p>Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. The feathers should be smooth, shiny, and lay flat on the body. The vent should be clean, dry, and free of fecal matter. The scales on the feet should be smooth, the nails and beak should be smooth and not overgrown, and the nostrils should be clear and clean with no clumping of the feathers surrounding them. </p> ",1198
8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-pigeon-diseases-4153044,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Common Pigeon Diseases</h1>,"<h1>Common Pigeon Diseases</h1><p>Pigeons are surprisingly popular pets. They, along with doves, are short-legged, stout-bodied birds that are found almost everywhere in the world in both the wild and our homes. As pets, we care for their every need, including treating many common diseases that they may get. These diseases can cause a variety of symptoms including breathing problems, diarrhea, and even death.</p><h3>Common Pigeon Diseases</h3><h2>Pigeon Canker </h2><p>Canker is caused by a tiny organism called a protozoan and typically causes breathing problems. It is a disease that is easily transmitted from bird to bird but thankfully it is not able to survive outside of a bird for more than a few minutes. Pigeons pass canker on to other pigeons when they share water bowls, exhibit billing with other adult pigeons, and feed young pigeons crop milk (a semi-solid, crumbly excretion high in fat and protein).</p><p>The organism that causes canker is typically found in a pigeon's crop, throat, bile duct, cloaca, proventriculus, or other parts of the digestive tract. Nodules from canker may also be found on the navel in a nestling pigeon or in pigeon sinuses. Symptoms of canker will vary depending on what part of the body it is found in but since it most commonly affects the throat, most pigeons will have breathing difficulties due to the nodules on the tonsils. Other signs of canker, besides the visible nodules and breathing issues, include diarrhea, weight loss, lethargy, and bleeding from the mouth and cloaca. Symptoms worsen if the disease is not treated and canker can cause death.</p><p>Canker lesions look like other kinds of infections (such as an abscess) but canker will only affect parts of the pigeon's body that are related to or close to the digestive tract. This means a lesion on a wing would definitely not be canker. The organism may also be seen microscopically in the feces. If your pigeon has canker, it can be treated with medication prescribed by your vet. Sometimes surgical removal of the nodule is necessary by your vet.</p><h2>Pigeon Worms </h2><p>Like many other types of animals, pigeons can harbor various kinds of worms in their intestinal tract. Roundworms, tapeworms,and hairworms grow and live in the digestive tract of pigeons and can cause diarrhea, weakness, increased susceptibility to other diseases, and performance issues in competitive pigeons. Sometimes you can see worms passed in the feces of a pigeon but oftentimes their eggs are found during a microscopic examination of the droppings.</p><p>Pigeons get worms from eating insects and ingesting infected droppings from other birds so it can be very difficult to prevent your pigeon from getting worms. Regular microscopic exams of your pigeon's droppings are recommended to screen for these parasites and treatment involves medication that, like other pigeon medicine, can be added to the water or given orally in a syringe.</p><h2>Pigeon Coccidia </h2><p>Similar to worms, coccidia is an intestinal protozoan that is found in pigeons and other animals and causes diarrhea, loss of nutrient absorption, weakness, lethargyand weight loss. Coccidia is easily transmitted from pigeon to pigeon when they ingest infected droppings and is often found in small, acceptable quantities in most pigeon lofts.If a pigeon is acting normally and a small amount of coccidia is found, it is often not treated.</p><p>Coccidia is a microscopic organism so you will not be able to see it without a microscope, therefore regular fecal examinations by your vet are recommended to make sure your pigeon does not have an abundance of coccidia. Despite small amounts of the protozoan being acceptable, if your pigeon has coccidia and loose droppings (the most common indication of coccidia) or other symptoms, they should receive medications to treat it.</p><h2>Pigeon Hexamita </h2><p>Very similar to the protozoan that causes canker in pigeons, this organism is also found in the digestive tract of pigeons. Thankfully, hexamita is not as serious for most pigeons as canker is but it is still recommended to treat a bird that is diagnosed with it. The organism can be found microscopically in feces and is often confused with canker due to its similar appearance. It can cause vomiting, weight loss, and bloody diarrhea if it overpopulates your pigeon's intestinal tract but typically goes unnoticed in normal pigeons.</p><h2>Pigeon Lice, Mitesand Flies </h2><p>External parasites, such as lice, mites,and flies are a real bother to your pet pigeon. These annoying pests not only bite and irritate your pigeon but can also cause more serious damage, such as blood loss or introduce disease to your bird. A scaly appearance to the unfeathered areas of your pigeon, tiny holes in the feather shafts,and itchy birds are all signs of external parasites. Depending on the type of parasite, medicated sprays are typically used on a pigeon that is infected.</p><h2>Pigeon Respiratory Infections </h2><p>Other than canker, respiratory infections are probably the most feared type of problem that pigeon owners face. Respiratory infections are extremely contagious. Stressed, old,and young birds are most susceptible to infection.</p><p>Respiratory infections make it hard for a bird to breathe and fly so they are less active and competing pigeons will perform poorly. If left untreated, a pigeon with a respiratory infection will be open mouth breathing, have an increased effort while breathing, sit fluffed up with their eyes closed, not eat,and will ultimately die.</p><p>Many things can cause a respiratory infection in a pigeon including fungi, viruses, bacteria, and mites. The infections can involve the lungs, air sacs, sinuses, and other parts of the respiratory tract. There may be visible discharge from the nares, inside the mouth or choana, or you may actually hear your pigeon sneezing and/or coughing if they have a respiratory infection. Aggressive treatment, including taking your bird to the vet when you see respiratory symptoms, environmental cleaning, treating underlying parasites that may have predisposed your pigeon to get sick, finding the cause of the infection, and medicating your pigeon,are all important in eradicating a respiratory infection.</p><h2>Pigeon Chlamydia </h2><p>There are many different strains of chlamydia in pigeons and some birds do not show symptoms. but if your pigeon is stressed they may have a flare-up of this virus.</p><p>Medications to treat the virus can be given to birds showing symptoms of chlamydia but the disease cannot be cured. Respiratory infections caused by the virus are the real concern in pigeons who have chlamydia so they are usually treated symptomatically while ensuring their environment is ideal (avoid dampness, fluctuating temperatures, etc.).</p><h2>Pigeon Mycoplasma </h2><p>Also a cause of respiratory infections, mycoplasma can infect pigeons in their respiratory tract. The symptoms of a mycoplasma infection are the same as those of a chlamydia and other respiratory infections so depending on the part of the respiratory tract that is infected, you may see nasal discharge, coughing, sneezing,and other symptoms.</p><p>Stress is again the primary reason why a pigeon will show symptoms of mycoplasma. Therefore, managing a clean, stress-free, ideal environment for your pigeon is crucial in keeping your bird healthy.</p>",1174
9,https://www.thesprucepets.com/facts-about-cockatoos-390716,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>Fascinating Facts About Cockatoos</h1>,"<h1>Fascinating Facts About Cockatoos</h1><p>Cockatoos are very popular pet birds with personalities as flashy and dynamic as their crest. While these birds may be best known for the fan of feathers that they display on tops of their heads, there are plenty of other fun and fascinating cockatoo facts for bird lovers to focus on.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Cockatoos includes 21 parrot species ranging from bare-eyed cockatoos and black palm cockatoos to citron cockatoos</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 24 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Depends on the species, but most cockatoos can live from 25 to 60 years of age</p><h2>From Down Under </h2><p>All21 species of cockatoos are native to Oceania. Specifically, cockatoos are endemic toAustralasia, including Australia, New Zealand, and New Guinea. They are also found in Indonesia and the Solomon Islands.</p><h2>Velcro Birds </h2><p>When hand-fed as babies and properly tamed,cockatoostend to form extremely strong bonds with their owners that last a lifetime. They are also known to be one of the most affectionate parrot species and sometimes called ""velcro"" birds.</p><p>These birds crave petting from their owners and prefer to be on or near them at all times. It's very important that you're able to devote the time this pet needs. That includes handling and socializing with them for at least two hours each day, if not more.</p><p>Some cockatoos can become depressed if they feel like they aren't getting enough attention. This can lead to side effects such as feather plucking and destructive behavior.</p><h2>The 3-Way Bite </h2><p>One of the most distinctive features of a cockatoo's body (aside from their impressive crests) are the lower mandibles of their beaks.</p><p>If you take a close look at a cockatoo's lower jaw, you'll notice a prominent ""U"" shaped region missing from the ""bottom lip"" area. This scoop-shaped feature allows a cockatoo to have what is known as a ""three-way"" bite. It gives their beaks extra power when clamping down on foods, branches, and even the fingers of their human caretakers.</p><p>Due to this feature, cockatoos have the capacity to deliver bites that are more painful and damaging than other birds of a similar size. It's something for prospective owners to keep in mind.</p><h2>Loud and Vocal </h2><p>While all parrots can scream, cockatoos are notoriously loud.A cockatoo's contact call can be heard for up to a mile or more away. This is especially true early in the morning and near sunset when they would naturally call out in the wild.</p><p>Because they have extremely boisterous voices, cockatoos are not recommended for people who live in small spaces. Bringing one home to an apartment complex or a townhouse can quickly splinter good relations with yourneighbors.</p><h2>Dimorphic </h2><p>Unlike many birds, most cockatoos are dimorphic, meaning the males and females are nearly identical. This makes knowing the sex of your feathered friend very difficult.</p><p>Some cockatoo species have very subtle differences between the sexes. For instance, males may be slightly larger than females or their plumage may be just a little bolder. You would have to have two cockatoos side by side to notice these differences, however.</p><p>For most cockatoos, the eyes hold the secret to the bird's sex. Females generally have light-colored eyes while the irises on males tend to be dark.</p><p>The only real way to know your bird's sex, however, is to get a DNA test. If you're very curious about it, you'll need to send a few feathers out to a lab.</p><p>The alternative is to simply call your bird whatever you feel he or she is and enjoy your time together. The bird won't know the difference and will love you just the same.</p><h2>Prone to Obesity </h2><p>Pet cockatoos have a propensity for weight gain and obesity. To prevent this, it's important to carefully monitor your bird's diet.</p><p>Cockatoo owners are typically encouraged to offer their birds only minimal access to seed. Instead, it's best to feed your birda variety of fresh, bird-safe fruits and vegetables. You can also reserve items such as nuts and bread for treats and refrain from including them in a bird's daily meal offerings.</p><p>Depending on the body condition of an individual bird, an avian vet might also offer more specific dietary recommendations.</p><h2>A Naughty Nature </h2><p>While cockatoos are very loving and devoted pets, they also have a naughty side. They love to chew and will destroy a poorly constructed cage if given the chance.</p><p>Quite often, this bad behavior can be kept in check by providing your bird with adequate attention and toys for distraction. It's important not to overindulge the bird so it requires even more from you and can handle some lone time when you're away. Set yourboundaries early and you should get along fine.</p><p>Rotating a variety of toys for your bird to play with will help out tremendously. This will help him stay engaged and burn off some energy tearing apart appropriate things. Some cockatoos will even develop an attachment to objects or begin to exhibit nesting behavior with their toys.</p><h2>The Crest </h2><p>The signature crest on top of every cockatoo's head can tell you a lot about how the bird is feeling. Interpreting its message at the moment, however, is a little tricky.</p><p>A raised crest is a very important part of this bird's body language. It can mean many different things. For instance, it's part of their natural mating ritual. In captivity, a cockatoo may dance around crest-up to show off for anyone willing to pay attention.</p><p>The crest can also be a sign of aggression or warning for many cockatoos. The notable exception is the umbrella cockatoo who will either ruffle all of his feathers or give you a mean glare when he's on the offensive.</p><p>In other instances, a raised crest may be a friendly greeting, a sign of curiosity, or used when the bird is startled. Once you get to know your bird, it will become easier to read the meaning behind this display.</p><h2>Limited Vocabulary </h2><p>Most cockatoos can certainly be taught to speak, though they're not the most proficient parrots in this area. Also, it's important to remember that not every bird will talk, so that should not be a primary reason to adopt any bird.</p><p>In general, a talkative cockatoo may learn 20 or so words and simple expressions over the years. With training, they will begin to associate certain phrases with specific circumstances as well. Even though they won't know the meaning of ""Good morning,"" for instance, a bird can learn that this is said when the sun rises or their person wakes up.</p><p>You will also hear them babble incoherently quite often. This chatter is a really fun part of life with a cockatoo, even if he learns no real words.</p><h2>Black Feathers Are Rare </h2><p>While most cockatoos are primarily white, some have a much darker plumage. One of the rarest and arguably most beautiful species is the black palm cockatoo.</p><p>While they are referred to as ""black,"" their plumage is actually a very dark, smokey gray color. The bright pinkish-red patches on their cheeks are a striking accent to their feathers. These features make them one of the most sought-after cockatoos in the pet trade.</p>",1162
10,https://www.thesprucepets.com/found-pet-bird-4768790,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>What to Do if You Found a Pet Bird</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if You Found a Pet Bird</h1><p>Losing a pet of any sort is a traumatic experience and everyone hopes that someone will find and return their furry or feathered friend. Adding to the challenge for owners of lost birds is the fact that they can fly great distances, greatly expanding the search radius. If you find a pet bird, what can you do to increase the chances of reconnecting the bird with its owner?</p><h2>How to Tell if It's a Pet Bird </h2><p>The first thing you may be wondering is how to tell whether you've found a pet bird or just a very docile wild bird. Three key factors to consider are breed, behavior, and identifications.</p><h3>Breed </h3><p>You might not be an expert on breed types, but is the bird you found native to your area? A quick search on the Internet combined with your observations can tell you a lot about whether or not the bird you found is likely to be a wild bird or someone's pet bird.</p><p>For example, cockatiels are a common sight in Australia, but aren't native to North America. If you see one of these colorfully plumed birds in your yard, there's a very significant chance it's a lost pet bird.</p><p>On the other hand, about 23 species of parrots are breeding in the wild in 25 states across United States. Not surprisingly, Florida, California, and Texas see the highest concentration of parrot populations, but even urban areas like Chicago and New York have seen established parrot populations. While all of these parrots were at one time in captivity or have descended from pet birds, the bird you find may in fact be wildeven though they're non-native to the United States.</p><h3>Behavior </h3><p>The behavior of a bird you find can be key in identifying whether it's a lost bird. Wild birds will very rarely land on or directly approach humans. However, a pet bird is accustomed to human care and interaction and may associate people with food and security.</p><p>It's not unheard of for a lost pet bird to perch on someone's shoulder or land in close proximity and squawk in an attempt to get attention. If a bird does this to you, it's almost certainly a pet bird.</p><p>Other indicators include a bird that shows up in your yard or on your deck or balcony and sticks around. While wild birds will return to their nest or carry on with their flight patterns, a lost pet bird may just be looking for shelter.</p><h3>Identification </h3><p>A huge help in figuring out whether you've found a pet bird is any identification on the bird itself. If the bird is sporting a leg band, that's likely a clear sign that this bird belongs to someone. Less visible, but equally useful, is a microchip. If you can catch the bird in question, bring it to a veterinarian who can scan the bird for a microchip that will hopefully contain the information necessary to reunite it with its owner.</p><h2>Tips to Find the Owner of a Lost Pet Bird </h2><p>Once you know that you've found someone's pet bird, the next step is to reunite your new feathered friend with his or her rightful owner. While you might be tempted to tuck a lost bird into a shiny new cage in your home, remember that people bond with their birds just like any other pet and they're likely looking everywhere and trying everything to locate their lost bird.</p><p>However, it can be tough to know how far from home a pet bird is. The best advice is to start local but search far and wide.</p><h3>Post a 'Found' Ad in Local Newspapers </h3><p>Many newspapers will publish these ads for free, so it's a simple way to advertise that you found someone's pet. Contact local city papers and regional papers to maximize exposure.</p><h3>Check Social Media for Local or National Pet Bird Groups </h3><p>Often, owners will post about their lost bird and people who have found birds can check these postings or provide information about a pet bird they've found.</p><p>Only post the basics about the bird you found, such as date and location where you came across the bird. The rightful owner should be able to identify characteristics such as breed, unique markings, etc.</p><h3>Contact the Police Department for Your City and Surrounding Communities </h3><p>Find out if anyone has reported a lost pet bird. Owners of pet birds are encouraged to file a lost property report, so this can be one way to find the rightful owner of the bird.</p><h3>Call Local Animal Shelters, Avian (Bird) Veterinarians, and Bird Shops </h3><p>Concerned owners will often give notice to animal shelters, bird or pet shops, and avian vets that they'll lost a pet bird in the hopes that someone will turn it into one of these places.</p><p>Additionally, a bird veterinarian can check and see if the bird you found has a microchip. If so, it might be possible to contact the owner directly through a national database.</p><h2>Where to Take a Pet Bird You Found </h2><p>If you can't find the owner of a pet bird or you're not equipped to care for the bird, you might be wondering what the next best step is. Birds require a safe space, suitable temperatures, and the right diet. If you can't continue to care for the bird that you've found, it's important to turn it over to a safe, trustworthy guardian who can continue the search for the bird's owner or find an appropriate new home.</p><h3>Bird Rescue Group </h3><p>If there are local or regional bird rescue groups in your area, these can be an ideal place to take a pet bird that you found. Often made up entirely of passionate and experienced bird owners, a rescue group for feathered friends will know how to care for the bird you found. They also may be able to assist in finding the bird's owner, or have a system in place for fostering and adopting lost pet birds.</p><h3>Avian Veterinarian </h3><p>Veterinarians with expertise in treating pet birds may be willing to take in a lost pet bird. They'll have the resources and experience necessary to keep the bird safe. Or, they may refer you to a reputable bird rescue group in the area.</p><h3>Animal Shelter or Humane Society </h3><p>Most animal shelters and humane societies aren't an ideal place to take a pet bird. Typically, these organizations focus on dogs and cats and lack the experience or resources for pet birds. This option should be at the bottom of your list but is certainly better than releasing a pet bird you found back into the wild to fend for itself.</p><p>If you find a lost pet bird, do your best to help reunite the bird with its owner. Follow the tips and suggestions in this article to increase the chances of returning a pet bird to its home.</p>",1133
11,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-of-stress-in-pet-birds-390437,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>Stress in Pet Birds</h1>,"<h1>Stress in Pet Birds</h1><h2>A bird that acts out may be feeling anxious</h2><p>Stress can play a large role in the overall health of both humans and their companion animals. Because pet birds are naturally very sensitive creatures, they tend to be unable to deal with stress as easily as other types of pets such as cats and dogs. Being able to recognize stress in your pet bird is important for maintaining an environment where your feathered friend can mentally and physically thrive in. It's a good idea for bird owners to learn how to monitor their birds' stress levels and make adjustments as needed to keep their pets healthy and happy.</p><h2>Why Do Birds Experience Stress? </h2><p>Like humans, birds can experience stress for a number of different reasons. Birds are creatures of habit. A change to their schedule or environment can be a stressor.</p><p>Changes to the environment, from a move to a new home, new family members or pets, outside noises (construction, trucks, thunder), paint color, or change of location can cause stress. A new routine (the owner's or the bird's) can be stress inducing. Unfamiliar wild animals, even seen from the window, like hawks, raccoons, deer, or something else can upset a bird. A change in the light cycle, like a move to a darker room, daylight savings, or a cage covering, can all cause a bird to be rattled.</p><h2>Signs Of Stress in Birds </h2><p>Birds can exhibit stress in a number of different ways. They should all be taken seriously and a vet should be consulted as soon as you notice these signs. Some can be more physically harmful than others, but all should be a matter of concern.</p><h2>Stress Bars </h2><p>One of the most common physical indications of stress in pet birds is the appearance of stress bars on a bird's feathers. Stress bars are small lines that run horizontally across the shafts of a bird's feathers. While it can be difficult to assess stress bars in feathers that are still on a bird, examining molted feathers can give a quick indication of whether or not a bird is having issues with a stressor in its environment. The presence of stress bars will not indicate exactly what is wrong with a bird. Rather, they're a red flag that bird owners can use to start looking for potential sources of stress that their pets may encounter.</p><h2>Feather Picking and Self Mutilation </h2><p>Another common sign of stress (and boredom) in birds is feather picking. It can occur in both large and small birds. It may be initiated by a stimulus (loud construction noise), but continue once the stimulus stops. Some birds will continue beyond self-picking into self-mutilation. They can chew on their skin and some will dig even deeper into the muscle or even bone. This can cause severe damage. Birds with these symptoms should be seen by a vet right away. They may be prescribed medication and fitted with an Elizabethan collar so they can't access their body.</p><h2>Aggression </h2><p>The sudden onset of aggression in a pet bird can also be an indicator that the bird is experiencing stress in its environment. Aggressive behaviors, such as biting, hissing, lunging, and excessive screaming, can manifest almost overnight.</p><p>If you notice this sort of behavioral change in your pet, it may be a good idea to schedule an appointment with an avian vet to rule out any possible health problems. If your bird gets a clean bill of health, then you can begin to figure out exactly what triggers the behavior, and how you can adjust your bird's environment or routine to make it more comfortable.</p><h2>Loss of Appetite </h2><p>If a bird who normally has a healthy appetite suddenly begins to show less interest in eating, it can be an indicator of stress and/or health problems. A good rule to follow in this type of situation is to schedule an appointment with an avian vet to make sure that the bird is not sick or injured. If your feathered friend's health checks out, you can then begin to try and decipher possible stressors in your home that may trigger appetite loss in your bird.</p><h2>A Change in Vocalization </h2><p>Some stressed birds will begin screaming. While occasional loud noises can be typical, purposeful screaming can be loud and annoying and a sign of stress. Other stressed birds will go in the opposite direction and decrease their vocalizations. A significantly quieter bird can be a sign of stress, boredom, or sickness.</p><h2>Repetitive Behavior </h2><p>Some birds, and especially cockatoos, will exhibit stereotypical behaviors when they are stressed. These could include pacing, toe-tapping, and head swinging. They exhibit these behaviors to stimulate themselves when extremely bored.</p><h2>Fear </h2><p>If a bird that is normally happy to be handled suddenly begins to act fearful of you or other family members, the person may be causing stress to the bird without even realizing it. It may not even be something that the person is doing directly to the bird; something as simple as a brightly colored shirt, a hat, or a new beard or mustache can be a trigger for a bird's fearful behavior.</p><p>Once you are able to identify a trigger, it is normally easy to remedy this sort of situation. If necessary, it is possible to condition a bird to eventually accept this sort of stressor through patience and practicing proper bonding techniques.</p><h2>Boredom </h2><p>Birds who begin to exhibit destructive behavior are quite possibly very stressed, and the most likely culprit in this scenario is boredom. Being the extremely intelligent creatures that they are, pet birds in captivity often do not receive a healthy amount of mental stimulation, which can lead to frustration, stress, undesirable behaviors, and even health issues.</p><h2>Treatment of Stress in Birds </h2><p>If there's a stressor in the bird's environment, removing it should cut down on its stress almost entirely. If the behavior is self-destructive and/or the stress cannot be determined, speak to a vet as soon as possible to come up with a treatment plan. A vet may prescribe a prescription treatment and/or recommend a behavioral specialist.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>While stress may not be entirely preventable, pay attention to your bird's cues and try to avoid sudden changes to its lifestyle. If a cage has been moved and the bird doesn't like it, move it back to slowly acclimate it to a new position. If new pets or family members are upsetting, again, try to acclimate the bird to the new member and focus on positive reinforcement (and treats). Being aware of the bird's general sensitivities before any changes are made will help prevent stress.</p>",1098
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hyacinth-macaws-390508,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>How to Care for Hyacinth Macaws (Blue Parrots)</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for Hyacinth Macaws (Blue Parrots)</h1><p>The beautiful, cobalt-blue hyacinth macaw is the largest of all parrots. It is a rare and threatened species that should be kept only by a very dedicatedowner who can provide for needs that are as large as the bird itself. This is a bird that is more common in zoos than it is in private homesand for good reason. It is a rare owner who has the time, patience, and financial resources to care for a unique and sensitive bird that is nearly as large as a bald eagle.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Hyacinth macaw, blue parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 40 inches from head to tail, a wingspan of 4 feet, weighing 2.6 to 3.7 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can live more than 60 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The hyacinth macaw is native to central and eastern South America. There are three main populations: one in the Pantanal wetland region of Brazil, eastern Bolivia, and northeastern Paraguay;another in the Cerrado region of Brazil's easterninterior; and one in the Amazon basin of Brazil. The hyacinth macaw prefers to dwell in palm swamps, woodlands, and semi-open areas and usually avoids dense, humid forests. It can usually be found in the open areas along major rivers.</p><p>English ornithologistand artist John Latham first described and cataloged the hyacinth macaw in 1790, and its numbers in the wild have been in steady decline since then due to a gradual reduction in habitat and steady demand for the bird in the pet trade and by indigenous tribes who hunt the birds for meat and for their ornamental feathers. As a result, the hyacinth macaw is listed in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species list,which prohibits international trade of parrot species. Both Brazil and Paraguay now protect the bird by law.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Though somewhat frightening in appearance due to its enormous size and powerful, sharp hooked beak, the hyacinth macaw is something of a gentle giant. Hyacinths are quite gentle by nature. They are easily trained by positive reinforcement and tend to bond strongly with their human caregivers.</p><p>Hyacinth macaws have a wide variety ofvocalizations, ranging from deep guttural growls andloud screeching to high trills. They are also capable of purring. They tend to make more noise when they form a large flock.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Hyacinth macaws are adeep shade of solid blue, with bright yellow patches around the eyes and beak.</p><h2>Care and Housing </h2><p>Hyacinth macaws are a handful to care for, so before seeking a breeder, check with animal rescue organizations and adoption agencies on the chance that a bird may have been given up by someone unable to care for it. Beyond this, macaws are not commonly sold in pet stores, so seek out a breeder specializing in this specimen.</p><p>These birds demand more time and attention than other species, so hyacinth macaws are definitely not the right pets for just anybody. Large, beautiful, and intelligent, they can be quite alluring,but resist the temptation to bring a hyacinth home without thoroughly thinking it through. Caring for this bird is an enormous undertaking that demands a long time commitment.</p><p>As might be expected with such a large bird, a hyacinth macaw requires a spacious area to live. There are very few commercial cages large enough for this bird, and almost none that the bird cannot break out of. Many owners find that a custom-designed cage is necessary, although a full room dedicated to the parrot is even better. This bird needs space to fly abouteven if it has had its wing feathers trimmed.</p><p>Most regular cages can easily be turned to rubble by the powerful beak. If you must keep the bird in a cage, the best bet is a cage made of stainless steel.Stainless steel cagesare far more durable and long-lasting and the benefits of owning one for years outweigh the cost in the long run. A stainless steel cage is a worthwhile investment.</p><p>Hyacinth macaws can be very destructive, and it is critical that the cage has lots of wooden toys and branches to chew on. You should expect to replace these frequently.</p><p>A hyacinth macaw's beak is a powerful tool,which means that they must be taught at an early age not to ""mouth"" their human caregivers,no matter how gently. Thankfully, they are usually quite docile and easygoing and seem to enjoy learning and human companionship. Like virtually all parrots, the hyacinth macaw is a highly social animal that requires a lot of interaction with its human caregiver in order to be emotionally happy. Neglected, confined birds are often described as ""neurotic,"" given to screaming, destructiveness, and self-mutilating behaviors such as feather-plucking. If they receive plenty of attention, though, they will prove to be among the friendliest of the macaw species, exceedingly interested in humans.</p><p>Although not the most fluent talkers of the macaws, a hyacinth can learn a few words and phrases, which it will repeat incessantly. They are highly intelligent, and may even learn to use those words in the proper context.</p><h2>Food </h2><p>In the wild, hyacinth macaws primarily feed on fruit, greenvegetation, and nutsespecially the nuts fromtheacuri and bocaiuvapalms. Its strong beak can even crack coconuts. In captivity, they do well on a diet of fruit, vegetables, leafy greens and plenty of nuts, particularly themacadamia nut,as they require more carbohydrates than other parrot species. A pet hyacinth's diet can be supplemented with specially formulated species-specific pellets.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>With a wingspan that can reach 4 feet, they must be given adequate time to exercise and room for a good stretch. It is a good idea to give a hyacinth a minimum of one to two hours of time each day on a playgym or other safe area per day to maintain their muscles.</p><p>These birdsalso need to chew to maintain their beak and jaws, so plenty of chewable toys are a must for these big beautiful birds.Large toysthat can handle the beating of a powerful beak are good choices, as well as toys that have strips or pieces of leather incorporated into them. The bird's impressive beak evolved to crack open large nuts found, and it is instinctive for them to use it for shredding and chipping at hard objects.</p><h2>Common Health Issues </h2><p>The hyacinth can be prone to overgrown beaks if they don't have an ongoing supply of toys and branches to destroy.</p><p>The key to good health with a hyacinth macaw is providing it with a diet that meets its special needs, along with regular health exams by an avian veterinarian.</p>",1072

Leadingauthorities on companion birds are finally sighting both foraging and nest building enrichment as very important aspects of companion bird care.</p><p>Experts now say that toys for your pet birds are just as important as their nutrition; they are a necessary part of maintaining good health. The reason is that toys contribute to both the mental and physical health of your bird because they play a critically important role in the bird's life.</p><h2>Not Just ""Something to Do"" </h2><p>Interacting with a toy not only stimulates a bird's mind, but it also keeps them active and engaged physically. Birds in nature of all species are always active, doing gymnastics daily. The world is their jungle gym. Sitting on a perch all day is not only unnatural and unhealthy, but an unoccupied bird might be considered a neglected bird.</p><p>If you have a normally busy lifestyle, you simply can't be there for your pet bird every minute of the day, so birds spend a significant amount of time on their own. What do these smart creatures do with all of that time? If they do not have an outlet to keep their minds and bodies busy solving puzzles, then most birds will turn their frustrations inward.</p><p>Like all very intelligent creatures, birds require stimulation and having reasons for their activity. With nothing to do, this affects a bird's state of mind. Once boredom sets in, birds may take it out on their feathers or just become listless, depressed, and unhealthy.</p><h2>The Call of the Wild </h2><p>All species of birds in the wild are constantly on the move, flying, hopping in trees from limb to limb, foraging for food, and even playing. Yes, birds in the wild do indeed play. They interact for fun and play with other birds as well as with inanimate, found objects as well.In the wild, birds have been observed flinging twigs around, stripping the bark off of twigs and tree limbs, bathing in puddles, hanging upside down and swinging as well as playing tag; these are all play activities. Crows have even been known to go ""sledding"" on their backs on snow-covered slopes in winter.</p><p>Birds also have natural survival instincts that need practicing; getting these ""life skills"" just right leads to plenty of play-like activities. They have an instinct to gnaw on wood as well as bark, leaves, and other objects. This instinct is what helps them to learn how to use tools, build nests, and create nesting hollows in trees, as these construction skills are not innate. Birds will observe other older birds and learn skills from each other. Learning how to gnaw with precision also allows them to be better at foraging for food.</p><h2>Physical Puzzles of the Natural World </h2><p>In captivity, toys are what provide the necessary physical materials for these natural play activities. By interacting with their toys, birds are acting out their natural urges to chew, to toss things around, and to dig and search. Creating and busyness are what keeps them moving and stimulates their minds.</p><p>Just as a child gets exercise for body and mind by being outside, running around, and building forts and castles, this playtime with toys is just as important for the bird's well being. Chewing actions help to keep birds' beaks in top condition and the physical exertions keep their muscles, tendons, and bones strong and in good condition. Exercise also burns off calories and birds simply need lots of activity to stay in good shape.</p><h2>Calming Hormonal Birds During the Breeding Season </h2><p>Does your bird ever get aggressive? Sometimes birds in breeding condition tend to get a little bit feisty due to an excess of normal seasonal hormones in their bodies. Even when you have a single bird or non-mating birds, these individuals will still be affected by the season. Things such as temperature and light changes from normal seasonal changes of the calendar are the cue for these hormonal fluctuations.</p><p>This natural extra energy needs to go somewhere, so safe toys are the ideal outlet for them. They can burn off the energy and let out any frustrations in a productive way. Giving a bird this outlet may just calm those hormones too and lower its aggression level toward you during these times.</p><h2>The Power to Choose </h2><p>Toys of many different shapes, colors, and textures provide interest to a bird because they offer choice and that decision gives your companion bird a ""job,"" so to speak. A choice is one of the most enriching things you can provide to a pet of any kind, but especially the intelligent birds.</p><p>Most birds are naturally independent and enjoy making choices for themselves. Toys not only keep your birds busy, but the choices can also instill confidence. A bird will decide things such as what toy to play, what exactly they want to do with it, and how and when to play with it.</p><p>What you might not expect though is that a toy does not need to be all that complicated for it to be considered a good toy to a bird. Have you seen a child playing for hours with nothing buta box? Birds play this way as well. Amazingly, even the simplest of objects can inspire some very imaginative and dedicated play.</p><p>For instance, the famous Gray Parrot, Alex from The Alex Foundation, was never too fond of toys. But if you gave Alex a cardboard box, he would spend hours making holes in it, customizing it, and turning it into a pile of rubble. Parrots can be especially fond of playing with paper plates.</p><h2>Cleaning Toys </h2><p>Ensuring that bird toys are always safe is important and yet often overlooked. Keep an eye on the condition of the toys. Toys are meant to be chewed on, thrown around, and banged, so it is only natural that toysget worn out with use.</p><p>Be vigilant about frayed cords and material, cracked plastic, or anything else that might injure your bird, poke an eye, or collect grime. Hazardous or unsafe items such as electric wiring and metal wiring should never beaccessible to your bird. Keep toys clean by washing with natural, scent-free soaps.</p><p>Purchasing toys from reputable suppliers with bird-safe products can also go a long way in assuring safety. For example, look for vegetable-dyed toys and vegetable-tanned leather when reading toy descriptions.</p><p>Once your toys are ""old hat"" and ignored by your bird, pass them on by donating them to a parrot adoption and education foundation. Used toys are a wonderful way to support their mission.</p>",1108

Many bird owners enjoy the interaction a trained bird has with them so species that are adept to learning make ideal pets for those who are looking for that type of opportunity.</p><p>Some trainable birds are large but size doesn't equate the ability to talk or do tricks. Both small and large birds can be taught to do many things. Check out this list of the top 10 trainable pet birds to find the species that is right for you. </p><h2>Macaws</h2><p>Macaws are primarily native to Central and South America and they are some of the largest pet birds. They are also some of the smartest. These colorful parrots are very social, love spending time with their owners, and can be trained to talk, perch, mimic, and do a variety of other things. Macaws can also be very loud and need a lot of space to spread their wings so they are not ideal for every home, though.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 32 inches; half the total body length is in the tail feathers</p><p>Weight: 35 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Feathers vary from species to species of scarlet, light blue, yellow; flight feathers are dark blue, dark red, gold, sometimes green; white skin around the eyes</p><h2>African Grey Parrots</h2><p>A famous African grey by the name of Alex helped this species become popular for its trainability. African greys can easily learn to talk and mimic noises and with a little more intense training, they can even learn colors and counting. These birds require a lot of social and mental stimulation so training sessions are perfect opportunities to build a bond with a pet African grey while also providing it with enrichment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 24 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Body feathers are varying shades of gray; tail feathers are red if Congo grey, black if Timneh grey</p><h2>Amazon Parrots</h2><p>While there are a variety of subspecies of Amazon parrots, all of them are very trainable birds. These stocky birds are often described as having difficult personalities but they are also very social and smart. Regular attention from their owners is often demanded and they thoroughly enjoy mentally challenging toys as well as training sessions.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 25 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body feathers; different head colorings depending the subspecies</p><h2>Cockatoos</h2><p>Cockatoos are quite the characters but they are also extremely trainable. They all have a characteristic crest on the top of their head that they will hold erect for a variety of reasons including fear, excitement, and aggression. Many times they will even hold their crest up while they are performing a trained behavior because they are having so much fun.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 28 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 30 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: White body in most species; some yellow feathers underneath the wings; reddish eyes in females and brown to black eyes in males, supposedly; less common species are rose or black colored</p><h2>Budgerigars</h2><p>Native to Australia, budgerigars are small but mighty birds since their size does not inhibit their abilities to be trained to talk or do tricks. Parakeets, as budgies are also commonly known as, can learn up to 200 words and since they are so small, they are nowhere as loud as their larger cousins. They also don't take up as much space, are much less expensive than larger birds, and are readily available to purchase from pet stores. All of these factors make budgerigars one of the most popular species of trainable birds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Light green body with black wing markings and yellow head; captive-bred colors include blue, gray, green, white, violet, yellow/blue</p><h2>Mynah Birds</h2><p>Often touted as the smartest bird in the world, the mynah bird is possibly the most trainable pet bird there is. Mynah birds are not as commonly seen as pets as some other birds but they can be purchased from select breeders. These birds need a lot of mental stimulation and room to explore but they are easily tamed if you choose to care for one of these highly intelligent birds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Brown body, black hooded head with a bare yellow patch behind the eye; bills and legs are bright yellow</p><h2>Cockatiels</h2><p>Sometimes underestimated in its trainability due to its prevalence in pet stores, the cockatiel is actually a very smart small bird. It is a little larger than the budgerigar and can easily learn to mimic and talk as well as do simple tricks. Because of these things, the cockatiel is a popular option for those that like the look of a cockatoo without the size and life span commitment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12-13 inches</p><p>Weight: 2-4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Classic coloration is a gray body with a yellow face and crest and orange cheek patch; multiple color mutations exist including albino, pied, lutino, and others</p><h2>Conures</h2><p>There are a number of species of conure but most are known to be very social, active, and quick learners. Like other birds, younger conures are often easier to train but many species love to use their feet to pick things up so some will learn how to perform special tricks. Conures aren't the best at talking, but if you're not looking for a chatty bird, these small to medium birds can be trained to do a variety of other things.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 to 4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Various species have differing colors; bodies may be orange, yellow, and red or primarily green</p><h2>Indian Ringnecks</h2><p>Known for their characteristic ring around their neck, Indian ringneck parrots have higher pitched voices than some other birds and are very trainable. Ringnecks may not start talking until they are closer to about one year of age but once they do, they can be excellent talkers. They can also learn how to perform many tricks and enjoy training sessions with their owners.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 37 to 43 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: A vast rainbow of color mutations exist; natural coloring is lime green body with a dark ring around the neck if they are a male parrot; females lack a ring</p><h2>Eclectus</h2><p>Eclectus parrots are known for their dramatic sexual dimorphism but they are also highly trainable birds. These colorful parrots are great at talking and learning behaviors. This means that they can easily learn how to do or say something that you teach them but like many other birds, they will also teach themselves things. This means you'll need to make sure you don't repeat or reinforce any unwanted words or behaviors.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 18 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Males are bright green; females are bright red and blue</p>",1104
15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/most-uncommon-pet-birds-390527,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>8 of the Most Exotic Pet Birds</h1>,"<h1>8 of the Most Exotic Pet Birds</h1><p>Many people are familiar with the most common and popular types of pet birds, such as budgies, finches, and cockatiels, but naming some of the more uncommon and exotic pet species can be a challenge. Whether you are researching these rare species in the hopes of adopting a unique pet or you are merely curious, you'll find some of these birds to be extremely unusual. Here are eight of the most exotic pet birds in the world.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Some of these larger bird species have specialized care requirements such as large ground habitats or high flight enclosures that make them less than ideal prospects for the average bird owner.</p><h2>Black Palm Cockatoo</h2><p>A bird that is as equally impressive as it is uncommon, the Black Palm Cockatoo is an eye-catching species that originates, like all cockatoos, in Australia. These very large birds are highly intelligent,but they aren't known for being especially affectionate. It is important that they receive proper training in order to make suitable pets. Black Palm Cockatoos are only recommended for highly experienced owners of large challenging parrots; this beautiful but bold bird requires a bold owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 31 to 42 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Very dark, smoky gray to black body, beak, feet, and legs; very long, dark crest;bright red patches of bare skin on cheeks; intimidating upper beak</p><h2>Victoria Crowned Pigeon</h2><p>Beautiful and unusual, Victoria Crowned Pigeons are very large birds, and yet, they are actually quite gentle and easy to tame. They need wide spaces in which to live and can be challenging to keep for this reason. While their dipping bird dances are intriguing, they spend much of their time running on the ground, so they cannot be kept caged like many pet bird species. Keepers of these birds must provide them with an expansive room or enclosed yard so that they are able to get the exercise they need to thrive.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 29 inches</p><p>Weight: 5.5 pounds</p><p>Physical Characteristics: French blue feathers, a dark mask, and maroon breast; a lighter shade of blue on the wings; a crest of dark blue lace with vivid white tips, red eyes</p><h2>Golden Conure</h2><p>Also known as the Queen of Bavaria Conure, the large, colorful, and striking Golden Conures are truly a sight to behold. But as too many of these birds have been captured from the wild, they have become endangered so they are increasingly hard to come by in the pet trade. They are considered rather uncommon as a result. While there are breeders that offer these birds for sale occasionally, all sales of Golden Conures are strictly regulated. It can be difficult to locate one. The survival of this species is not assured.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics:  Bright yellow body; dark green tips of flight feathers; pink legs and feet</p><h2>Australian King Parrot</h2><p>A beautiful and uncommon bird from Down Under is the brightly feathered Australian King Parrot. They are the only parrot species with an entirely red head. Highly intelligent birds, they can form close bonds with their owners but seem to be a little more resistant to affection than other types of birds. These birds are good candidates for owners who have plenty of experience keeping and working with the hard-beaked hookbills. As very large birds, they need plenty of space to exercise and play in order to thrive in captivity.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 16 to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 9 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright red plumage on the heads and chests, vivid green feathers on the backs and tails, and blue feathers underneath the wings (male); green feathers on the heads, backs, and chests, red bellies, patch of blue on the rumps (female); gray feet and legs</p><h2>Archangel Pigeon </h2><p>Pigeon breeds such as the Archangels, Kings, Fantails, Tumblers, and Homers are smart, beautiful, and gentle birds. They've been selectively bred and tamed, and while they can't survive in the wild, they thrive as pets. The splendid Archangel is considered first and foremost to be a color variety. This shimmering pigeon claims a long history. Going back as early as the 13th century, this breed of pigeon has evolved alongside the monarchies of many European countries.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 13 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 12 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bronze or gold body with wings of black, white, or blue; unfeathered legs and dark orange eyes; possibly crested</p><h2>Green Aracari </h2><p>The Green Aracari is one of the smallest members of thetoucanfamily. Toucan keepers know how difficult these birds are to keep in a home; many more hazards are involved with them than with even the large parrots. First, with a need for a constant supply of ripe, fresh fruit, these birds are expensive to feed. A toucan's fruit is also flung about all day long, so walls near aracari enclosures must be washed often. Moreover, toucans will ingest any sort of dangerous, life-threatening objects, so vigilance is key. Lastly, these birds fly quickly and directly into handlers' faces; goggles or protective eyewear are a must.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 4.5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Black head and neck (males); bright chestnut head and neck (females); bare turquoise skin in front of eyes, red skin behind the eyes; yellow, dark red and black bill</p><h2>American Crow</h2><p>Crows and ravens are in the family Corvidae; they are the incredibly intelligent black and shiny birds of worldwide literature and folklore. However, corvids are protected and illegal to own as pets in the United States and in many other countries. Wildlife authorities are aware that if they were allowed to be pets, nest robbers would sell baby birds and wild populations would plummet as has been the case with many parrot species in many countries around the world.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 22 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: All black; stout beak, black legs and feet, brown eyes</p><h2>Owl </h2><p>Possibly the most uncommon of the pet birds are the owls. While owls are commonly depicted as loyal pets in books and movies, in reality, they are simply not suited to life in captivity. All owls are antisocial, lone hunters that do not bond with people, and they bite. But perhaps the most important factor is their unique dietary requirement. In order to stay healthy, these raptors must be fed whole rodents on a daily basis; attempting to supplement or change their diet inevitably fails. Coupled with the fact that keeping captive owls is illegal without special permits in all of North America and most of the world, it's no wonder that they are very uncommon pets.</p>",1081
16,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-your-bird-flies-away-390732,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>Retrieving Pet Birds That Escape the Home</h1>,"<h1>Retrieving Pet Birds That Escape the Home</h1><p>For most pet bird owners,the thought of their bird flying away is their worst nightmare. If a bird happens to get loose, it's a dangerous situation because a domesticated bird is unlikely to be able to care for itself in the great outdoors.</p><p>The best ways to prevent your pet from escaping is to be diligent about your ""double door boundary"" habits (closing external doors before opening internal doors) and your wing trimming practices, but if your bird escapes, there are some immediate and longer-term steps that may help the ordeal end in a safe recovery.</p><h2>Immediate Response </h2><p>Timing is critical when you are dealing with a fly-away. To have the best possible chances of recovery, you must spring into action the moment that you discover your bird missing. Use all available people present including whoever can be called in quickly. Delegate tasks so that all immediate steps are happening at once.</p><p>Immediately assign a few people to scan all nearby trees, poles, and any other obvious perches on your property and the surrounding properties. Have your volunteers examine each tree from 360-degree angles as even brightly-colored birds will be hidden by branches.</p><p>Delegate someone to collect up all available fishing nets, bird nets, and a few lightweight bathroom towels to hand out. If you can locate the bird, and if you can get it to  it may want to fly back toward you; use the towel to throw over the top of it, if you can.</p><h2>Imagining What the Bird Sees </h2><p>In lucky cases, the bird will be in shock and be too afraid to move at all. In those instances, be sure to keep a close eye on the bird as you try to work out a plan for bringing the bird's cage as close as possible to where the bird is.</p><p>Birds will usually choose familiar food and shelter whenever they can locate it, as long as the bird understands how to fly down and make a downward landing. And yet many pet birds that have been raised indoors and not in tall trees have never had to learn this skill. Some hours of calming and consideration may be necessary before a bird will find the courage to flap down. But often, escaped birds immediately go on the move.</p><p>Escapes are frantic and birds aren't paying attention to where they're flying. Try to imagine the scene from a bird's eye view. Realize that your bird has never seen where it lives from the air and has no way of identifying where home is. Assuring that your bird maintains non-stop visual contact with you is imperative. Wear brightly colored clothing and use yourself as a slow-moving familiar beacon to urge the bird closer to you and to the cage, which should be brought as close to the bird as possible in the first hours.</p><p>When the bird has been spotted, arrange a team of people to track the bird's location, around the clock if possible, so that eyes are always on the bird. Don't let the rain discourage you. A bird that has lost sight of anything familiar will begin to search in ever-widening circles, making matters worse.</p><h2>Bringing the Cage Near the Bird </h2><p>Whenever possible, bring the cage to the bird. For a missing bird, place the cage near the site of the fly-away. If your bird flies out through your front door, for example, place the cage on your porch or doorstep. Whenever possible, hang the cage outside so that it appears just as it would indoors.</p><p>Add large amounts of your bird's favorite foods and tasty treats in or around the cage to lure the bird back home.Someone should always be at the ready near the cage to pounce with a towel or net. Use large pieces of food that are easily visible, and leave the cage with the door open, possibly rigged with a quick-release trap door latch to quickly lock as soon as the bird enters.</p><h2>Using Familiar Sounds </h2><p>If you are unable to lure a missing bird back home with cage and food, try ""calling"" it by name and simply remain in the area, repeating familiar words, sounds, and phrases. In some instances, this may entice your pet to fly down to you.</p><p>If you regularly play music of a certain type, play some quietly outside. Make it easy for the bird to locate where the sound is originating as a familiar beacon.</p><h2>Casting a Wider Net with Community Help </h2><p>Sometimes even the best immediate efforts fall short; if you lose visual contact with your bird for most of a day, it's time to launch Plan B.</p><p>Alert the neighborhood through social media and posted signs, listing your bird's name and description with photos. Request that spotters report immediately any sightings, noting their exact location, and to keep their eyes on the bird until help arrives.</p><p>Neighborhood kids may love searching for birds, especially is a reward is offered. Alert all local bird clubs, vets, lost and found centers, and list your bird with 911 rescue bird sites that cover your area.</p><h2>Awaiting Exhausted Birds </h2><p>Day 1 of freedom for any bird is exciting with much activity. Day 2 will be quieter. No food supply exists for exotic birds in the outdoors, so by Day 3, your bird will be hungry, dehydrated, and exhausted from lack of sleep plus excessive exercise. Birds in this state will often fly to strangers, seeking help from even unfamiliar humans. At this point, they are easily caught.</p><p>Even after weeks on the loose, birds get retrieved this way, so make sure that all obvious reporting agencies have your contact information. Once home, your tired bird will be so happy to be with you, safe and sound.</p><h2>Preventing Any Escape </h2><p>An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so teaching birds some ""freedom skills"" will make any emergency retrieval faster and easier. Teach your bird to come to your ""recall cue,"" and to fly to a brightly colored ""station target"" to receive a favorite reward. Also remember to teach the bird to fly down to you from taller and taller perches, door tops, stairwells, and second-floor balconies if available.</p><p>To help ensure that your pet doesn't get lost, post a DO NOT ENTER sign on all doors to warn people when your bird is outside the cage. Check all flight feathers regularly to make sure they don't need to be re-clipped, and you'll (hopefully) never need to worry about losing your bird to a fly-away.</p>",1078
17,https://www.thesprucepets.com/five-most-popular-bird-species-390546,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>8 Most Popular Companion Birds as Pets</h1>,"<h1>8 Most Popular Companion Birds as Pets</h1><p>If you're considering adopting a pet bird to be a close companion, there are many popular species to choose from, but they all have unique socialization requirements regarding other flock mates and training needs. As with most birds, companionship is a two-way street; species that provide good company for humans often require the same social bonding in return. Here is a look at eight of the bird species known to be the most popular companions for their ""human flocks"" along with details about their social requirements.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Utilize local bird rescues during the species selection process; these adoption and education organizations are highly skilled at matching a bird to an individual or a family. When blindly purchasing a bird without knowing anything about the traits and needs of a particular species, detrimental mismatches are common.</p><h2>Parakeet/Budgie</h2><p>The common parakeet, or budgerigar, makes a wonderful pet for children or for those who are new to keeping birds; they are smart and playful yet they require less space and maintenance than larger bird species. While these birds are smaller than their bigger peers, they require the same attention and care. Budgies are quite intelligent in spite of their small size, and while most are content to whistle and sing, many have been known to learn words and phrases. These hardy little birds come in an array of beautiful colors, and their average life expectancy is 12 to 14 years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Light green body with black wing markings and yellow head; captive-bred colors of blue, gray, green, white, violet, yellow/blue</p><h2>Cockatiel</h2><p>These medium-sized birds are simply a delight to keep. Members of the parrot family, these Australian natives are known for their surprisingly advanced whistling and singing abilities. While cockatiels are capable of learning to talk, many owners find that their birds prefer to whistle and to mimic quirky sounds such as the ringing of a telephone. These birds are available in increasingly diverse color combinations and have an average life expectancy of between 15 and 20 years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 2.5 to 3.5 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Light gray body with long, dark gray tail, yellow and gray crest, yellow face; orange ear patch and white on the wing; dark gray bill</p><h2>Finch</h2><p>Finches and canaries (a species of finch) are ever-popular companion birds. With most varieties measuring just five inches or less, finches and canaries require less space than almost any other pet bird species. Unlike the parrots, which are all hard-beaked hookbill birds, finches and canaries are known as softbills or waxbill birds; they have somewhat pliable, waxy beaks. These little birds thrive in small flocksand generally pay little attention to humans which makes them perfect pets for those who love to watch birdsbut want a pet that requires less interaction. A finch or canary can live up to 10 years if it is well cared for.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 1/2 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright yellow, whitish, or reddish body</p><h2>Lovebird</h2><p>Lovebirds are one of the smallest parrot species. These colorful little birds should not be overlooked in favor of larger, more demanding parrots as lovebirds possess all the intelligence and personality of the largest of macaws. These birds are fairly quiet companions, making them ideal for those who live in apartments or condominiums. The lovebird has a life expectancy of up to 20 years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly green, orange upper body and head, blue lower back and rump, red beak, white eyerings</p><h2>Monk Parakeet</h2><p>The monk parakeet or quaker is actually a small parrot. It is well known for its ability to build a large vocabulary or words and phrases. The more you verbally explain what you are doing around the cage, the more this bird will pick up on the words for things and how to mimics those words. Monk parakeets have a life expectancy of 20 to 30 years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright green, white or blue body; gray breast, cheeks, and throat resembles colonial-era Quaker clothing; orange beaks</p><h2>Dove</h2><p>Doves are known for their sweet and gentle dispositions. Unlike the hookbill parrots,softbills doves rarely try to bite or do damage with their beaks. Still, it always helps to use calm and positive socialization andbondingtechniques with these birds. Doves can be a good choice as a pet for older children who understand how to be calm and gentle with companion animals. Doves need companionship too, and if kept alone indoors, they should be allowed plenty of free flight time out of the cage to interact with human caretakers. Mirrors and swings inside a dove's enclosure are a good idea.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 8 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Pure white, gray, white with gray, tangerine, pied, and orange; black eyes, black bill, dark purple feet</p><h2>Parrotlet</h2><p>From the tropical forests of Ecuador and Peru, parrotlets are genetically most closely related to the much larger Amazon parrot. Even though these birds are tiny, they have the same temperament and intelligence as their larger cousins. Relatively new to captivity, a parrotlet's wild streak is still intact. Without earlyproper handling, parrotlets can become competitive. Because they can be aggressive with other birds, territorial fights might break out during feeding time; hence, they often do better when kept by themselves. When miniature parrots act fearlessly, that can also get them into trouble in a home with dogs and cats. Feisty parrotlets may not back down from a confrontation with your furry pets. These diminutive parrotlets have a lifespan of up to 30 years.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly green; splashes of bright blue on their backs and behind the eyes (males); zygodactyl feet: two toes forward-pointing, two toes rear-pointing</p><h2>African Gray Parrot</h2><p>African Grays have been said to be the most intelligent of birds with some boasting very large vocabularies. Because these birds are so smart, they tend to be demanding pets that will get bored and depressed very quickly if not stimulated for at least five hours per day. But if you are looking for a highly intelligent and affectionate forever friend, the African Gray may be a fit. Grays are amazing birds that are easily trained once you learn the training techniques of positive reinforcement and operant conditioning.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 18 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Varying shades of gray on the body; red tail feathers</p>",1067

There are, however, birds that are fearful and those with emotional problems that cause them to want to avoid being handled. When one of these birds finds itself in a situation as a pet, it can be problematic for both bird and owner, possibly leading to bird aggression. Fortunately, you can train your bird to enjoy the time it spends with you.</p><h2>Why Are Pet Birds Aggressive? </h2><p>The most common causes of aggression in birds are fear or previous traumatic experiences. These can lead to handling problems, bites, and attacks when birds are interacting with their owners and others.</p><h2>How to Stop Aggressive Behavior </h2><p>If your pet bird bites you when you try to handle it, you must set aside time each day to work on handling your feathered friend. This doesn't have to be anything specific; you can incorporate your attempts to reduce your bird's aggression into normal handling. For instance, you might need to work on bonding with your bird or train it to enjoy petting. You can even teach it how to do fun bird tricks. The point is that the more you work with your bird, the more it will enjoy your company, and the less aggressive it will act.</p><p>When working with your pet, a few tips and techniques will help it to learn that handling is safe and fun.</p><h2>Move to a Neutral Location </h2><p>If possible, move your bird's cage to a neutral location during training sessions. Removing a bird from its ""territory"" can sometimes make it more willing to cooperate with its owner and prevent any territorial aggression.</p><h2>Don't Force Contact </h2><p>If your bird lunges at your fingers when you place your hand near it, try not to jerk away suddenly out of fear. Your swift movements will likely make your bird even more nervous and apprehensive.</p><p>Taking it slow and easy is the better method; don't try to force contact. Try to leave it up to the bird to decide when it's comfortable enough to step up or accept a treat.</p><h2>Try Stick Training </h2><p>Training a bird to step up on a stick or a perch is referred to as ""stick training."" It's the recommended alternative to training a bird that's not able to be handled at first. It's a less invasive approach and easier for a bird that is fearful or was traumatized in the past to accept this way of moving without force.</p><h2>Avoid Yelling </h2><p>Raising your voice in anger (or pain) will not make your bird understand that it has done something wrong. In fact, it's more likely to reinforce your bird's bad behavior as it will  getting such a big reaction out of you. Whatever happens, avoid the temptation to yell at or punish your bird.</p><h2>Bear Gifts </h2><p>Offer your bird treats and speak in a soothing voice when you're trying to handle it. Using treats and praise will help your pet be more willing to interact with you and it's much more effective than discipline. If every interaction with your bird results in a positive experience, it will likely become more comfortable and open to a closer relationship with you.</p><p>Many people try to force interaction in the hope that this will stop the bird from resisting and it will simply give in to being handled. This is referred to as ""flooding"" and it's not recommended as a training technique.</p><h2>Build Trust Through Repetition </h2><p>With birds, repetition and consistency are keys to training. Make time to work with your bird at least once a day to ensure success. Keep in mind that it sometimes takes a while to build up trust with a bird, so don't give up!</p><h2>Don't Overwork Your Bird </h2><p>Initially, keep training sessions at a 15-minute maximum. Birds are intelligent and sensitive creatures, and they need to have some fun in order to maintain their mental health and keep from becoming stressed.</p><h2>Break the Pair Bond </h2><p>If your bird becomes jealous of your interactions with other people, you will need to enlist the help of family members and visitors. The goal is to better socialize your bird and show it that these people are not a threat to the relationship it has with you.</p><p>Try various confidence-building exercises with other people and stay nearby to show your approval. You might, for instance, have visitors offer your bird a treat whenever they enter the house. To reinforce good behavior, they should also praise the bird in a happy, upbeat voice while making eye contact.</p><p>Another exercise is to lay out your bird's food on a towel in front of the bird and have your family pick at it with their fingers, just like a bird does with its beak. If you do this regularly, your bird may want to join in the fun. They can also help you clean the cage or give your bird food or water so it is comfortable with your family's presence.</p><h2>Keep a Flexible Routine </h2><p>Birds need mental stimulation and many enjoy a routine, so regular time for food, play, and other interactions each day is a good idea. However, some birds may react negatively if a routine is too rigid and gets disrupted.</p><p>For example, if you get home from work at a certain time each day and immediately let your bird out for playtime, being late one day could lead the bird to act out. Try to employ some flexibility in your daily routines that involve your bird. It will help the bird better tolerate change and understand that things won't always happen in a particular order or at a certain time, but it will happen.</p><h2>Get Professional Help </h2><p>If you put in the necessary effort, chances are you will be able to train your pet in a reasonable amount of time. If your bird is so aggressive that you cannot attempt training exercises, the first thing you should do is visit your avian veterinarian to rule out any health concerns. When no physical reasons can explain your pet's undesirable behavior, contact a certified parrot behavior consultant for an expert opinion on your situation.</p>",1020
19,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-beak-problems-in-birds-5224648,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Common Beak Problems in Birds</h1>,"<h1>Common Beak Problems in Birds</h1><p>Beak problems are unfortunately far too common in pet birds, and they can cause serious difficulties in daily functions. Eating issues, as well as climbing and holding toys, can be inhibited by an unhealthy or painful beak. Thankfully, though, these common beak problems are largely avoidable. Different types of beak problems exist, and they may be due to malnutrition, disease, or even trauma, but by knowing about some of the more common issues, bird owners will be better equipped to prevent them from happening.</p><h2>What Are Common Beak Problems in Birds? </h2><p>Common beak problems in birds are issues that cause an abnormal change in a bird's bill. Birds use their beaks almost as another appendage and also to eat and drink so normal daily functions can be difficult if your bird has a beak problem. Common beak problems are often defined by the types of abnormalities that are seen on the beak and they can happen to any kind of bird from macaws to budgies.</p><h2>Symptoms of Common Beak Problems in Birds </h2><p>Birds can develop a variety of beak problems from simply aesthetic issues to severely painful and very serious ones. </p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Masses or Growths </h3><p>While less common than other beak problems, growths can form on the beak. This is typically an indication of melanoma or squamous cell carcinoma. These are very serious diseases and require veterinary attention.</p><h3>Holes or Pitting </h3><p>A bird's beak should be pretty smooth, if there are holes or pits in the surface, this is an indication of a problem. These holes can also create instability and lead to breakage or create places for food and other debris to become lodged and encourage an infection.</p><h3>Discoloration </h3><p>Some birds have light colored beaks, some have dark colored beaks, and others have a combination of normal colors. An indication of a beak problem in a bird is when the beak turns an abnormal color in one area.</p><h3>Softening </h3><p>Depending on the species of bird you own, the beak should be hard enough to use to grasp and climb, as well as crack open seeds and nuts. A beak should never be soft or pliable so if part of it becomes weak and is able to be bent, this is a problem. Soft spots on the beak that then turn into holes are also very concerning. </p><h3>Peeling or Flaking </h3><p>Beaks are made of keratin so, like nails, they continually grow. Some times during this growth process, different layers are seen and a small amount of flaking can be normal but large amounts are not. If your bird's beak is regularly peeling or flaking, this is a problem and indicates an unhealthy beak. </p><h3>Cracks </h3><p>Beaks are strong; they should not be easily traumatized or break, but sometimes they develop a crack. This crack may be due to an injury or because the beak is soft and unhealthy, A normal beak should never have a crack in it.</p><h3>Pieces Breaking Off </h3><p>While it can be normal for a healthy beak to have some small pieces to break off as it grows, large pieces that cause the beak to no longer be smooth are not normal. Pieces may break off as a result of trauma or because the beak is unhealthy.</p><h3>Overgrowth </h3><p>Beaks continually grow, so if they are not worn down in a natural manner, they can become overgrown. This can happen to both the top and bottom parts of the beak, and if they become long enough, they may even criss-cross and result in a scissor beak. Overgrown beaks can prevent a bird from eating, climbing, and holding toys, so even if it isn't painful or due to an underlying disease, this problem should not be ignored.</p><h3>Abnormal Shape </h3><p>Different species of birds may have differently shaped beaks, but if your bird's beak starts growing in an abnormal shape, this means there is an issue. Severe trauma to the beak can permanently damage how it will grow in the future, but some diseases can also cause abnormal growth. </p><h2>Causes of Beak Problems in Birds </h2><p>There are a variety of things that can cause beak problems in birds and most are preventable.</p><h2>Diagnosing Beak Problems in Birds </h2><p>In order to diagnose the cause of a beak problem in a bird, your veterinarian will discuss your bird's environment and diet at length. This, depending on the specific type of beak problem, will help them determine whether there is something that could be causing or contributing to your bird's beak problem. A full physical examination will be next, and if any laboratory testing is needed, samples will be obtained. Blood tests will be needed to determine if your bird has liver or other underlying diseases, and a cytology and/or culture will be performed if a bacterial or fungal infection is suspected.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Once you discover the cause of your bird's beak problem, a treatment plan to correct or manage the issue can be recommended. This treatment plan may include a beak trim, medications, dietary additions or changes, and environmental modifications. Depending on the reason for the beak problems, this treatment plan may be temporary or a permanent change to your bird's lifestyle.</p><h2>Prognosis for Birds With Beak Problems </h2><p>Most beak problems in birds are able to be corrected or managed, but some may be due to a serious underlying disease. The prognosis for a beak problem that is caused by a dietary or environmental issue is usually very good but for underlying diseases and infections, it may not be. Cancer, some infections, and even liver disease may not have as good of a prognosis as a problem that can be corrected by a dietary or environmental change.</p><h2>How to Prevent Beak Problems </h2><p>Birds require specific nutrition and environments well-suited for their species. The best way to prevent your bird from developing beak problems is to provide it with these things. Proper diets will contain all the necessary vitamins and minerals that your bird needs and environments with appropriate chew toys, perches, and climbing options will help keep a beak properly groomed. Ensuring your bird is always in a safe environment will also help decrease the likelihood of a traumatic injury that can cause beak problems. </p>",1019
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-bird-screaming-4148339,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>Why Is Your Pet Bird Screaming?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is Your Pet Bird Screaming?</h1><p>Birds are beautiful and elegant but they can also be very loud, especially if they are a large pet bird that lives in your house. Parrots are especially known to be loud but is it normal for them to scream? Occasional screams are normal but if you find that your birdscreams a lot it may be because something is wrong.</p><h2>Bird Vocalizations </h2><p>Birds in the psittacine family, such as macaws, African greys, and other parrots,make a variety of noises and many can even mimic words we say and other sounds they hear in our homes. Some noises are also very natural and normal for a bird to makesquawking, cooing, chirping, trilling, purring, chuckling, and other noises will be made by both wild and pet birds. Learned vocalizations on the other hand, such as words, noises birds hear in our homes like phones ringing and oven timers, and kissing noises are all picked up by pet birds from living with humans. They are typically welcomed and often even regarded as being cute and encouraged.</p><p>Other noises that birds make, such as screaming, may start as just another natural vocalization, but can quickly become annoying. Screaming is a natural reaction to being scared or startled. The noise is often accompanied by some body language (e.g., pacing and puffing up) but pet birds, unfortunately, can also start screaming for other reasons that should be addressed.</p><h2>Birds Screaming Out of Fear or Jealousy </h2><p>Just like us humans, our pet birds can get scared and scream out of fear or jealousy. One common reason for your pet bird to get scared at home is when they see a potential predator. Animals outside, such as other birds (like hawks) or cats, as well as other pets in the house may scare your bird and cause them to scream. This scream is usually accompanied by stalking or pacing, fiercely staring at the predator, and puffing up to make themselves look bigger. They will only scream like this when they see this predator so by blocking their line of sight out of the window or removing the predator from their environment in another manner should stop the screaming.</p><p>Other reasons why your bird may be scared can be numerous. Vet visits are often scary since they aren't a regular occurrence and your bird doesn't know what is going on, new people in your house can frighten your bird and cause them to scream, and even unknown noises, new toys, a change in furniture in the room they live in, or a new cage can startle or scare your bird. Sometimes it is not obvious what is frightening your bird but if you pay attention to them and what they are looking at when they scream you should be able to figure out the culprit.</p><p>Jealousy is often seen in birds that bond with their owners or another bird. When their bonded mate is interacting with another person or pet they may scream to let them know they are upset.</p><h2>Birds Screaming for Attention </h2><p>The most common problems large bird owners have with their pets are usually behavioral issues, including screaming. Birds are very active, intelligent, and need constant mental stimulation in order to stay happy and healthy. If they get bored they will tell you in some way. Boredom is often exhibited with destructive behavior, obsessive behaviors like pacing, biting, feather or skin picking, or screaming, among other things. Screaming may start as a normal reaction to something or a quick alarm for attention. It can then develop over time into an annoying, lengthy, ear-piercing noise that affects your quality of life.</p><p>Bird screams can worsen over time because many people naturally react to their bird screaming by yelling back. This yelling back only reinforces the screamingwhen you scream at your bird to be quiet or stop, they think you are both yelling and they are getting attention so they do it more.</p><p>In order to stop the screaming attention-seeking behavior, you need to give your bird something to do other than scream. Enrichment activities that keep your bird busy and mentally stimulated are the best ways to decrease this type of behavior. Ignoring the screaming is very hard for anyone to do so it is often easier to prevent the behavior.</p><h2>Prevent Your Bird From Screaming for Attention </h2><p>If your bird is not screaming out of fear but rather for attention, you can prevent this behavior by keeping them busy. Birds spend the majority of their wild lives flying and searching for food but as pets we often fail as owners by clipping their wings, restricting their flight, and having them sit on a perch for a large portion of their days with us. This is not only unnatural but very boring for your bird, therefore, they cry for attention in the form of an ear-piercing scream.</p><p>A number of toys meant to make your bird use their mind and give them something to do can be purchased or made at home. Other enrichment activities such as hiding food, rather than just filling a bowl up with food, can also be provided to your bird to keep them occupied for a while. Videos of other birds, music, sounds of bird calls, or other visual and audible enrichment can also help keep your bird's attention. These things will keep your bird from getting bored and screaming for attention.</p><h2>Substitute Your Bird's Screaming Behavior </h2><p>Another tactic to decrease or stop your bird's screaming behavior is to replace or substitute it with another acceptable behavior. Many people, instead of yelling back at their screaming bird, repeat a specific word and teach their bird to say this word instead of scream. They also practice positive reinforcement by rewarding their bird when they are doing things that are acceptable and ignoring behaviors that are not.</p><p>Ignoring screaming is very hard, especially if your bird has developed a bad habit of it. Start by increasing enrichment opportunities, rewarding good behavior, covering your bird's cage if they are screaming, and ignoring the screaming by saying nothing to them while they are doing it. With patience and persistence, you can break the habit and help your bird have a happier, quieter life.</p>",1030

The most common one, the ring-necked dove, makes a friendly, non-demanding pet that can be kept either indoors or outdoors.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Ring-necked dove, white dove</p><p>Adult Size: 8 and 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 25 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>While ring-neck doves originally hail from Africa, there are other dove species indigenous to places all over the world. For example,fruit doves are endemic to Australia while mourning dovesare one of the most prolific and widely recognized wild bird species in North America. Only the aridest areas of the Sahara and the coldest arctic regions are without some species of the  suborder.</p><p>Different dove species prefer different habitats, and while overall this is not a group that is endangered, roughly 59 of the more than 300 species are threatened with extinction.</p><p>In the wild, theform that is native to Africa is highly dependent on the presence of water, and it eats primarily seeds, supplemented with fruits and berries. Provided enough water and food sources are present, it can inhabit nearly any environment, from grasslands to dense forests. This hardiness and adaptability makesS. risoria the favorite breeding stock for domestic doves.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Tame, domesticated, handfed doves are known for their sweet and gentle dispositions. Unlike parrots,softbillssuch as doves rarely try to bite or do damage with their beaks. Some doves can be a bit more nervous with people than others, but this can often be calmed by using positive socialization andbondingtechniques. Because of their largely peaceful nature, doves can be a good choice as a pet for older children who understand how to be calm and gentle with companion animals.</p><h2>Dove Colors and Markings </h2><p>In the wild, a ring-necked dove sportsdull tones of grey and brown over most of the body, with a darker collar on the nape of the neck. Pet doves can come in a rainbow of selectively bred colors and color combinations, includingpure white, tangerine, pied, and orange. The most commonly recognized pet dove colors are white, gray, or a combination of the two, with various species-specific markings. The eyes are black, the bill is black, and the feet are dark purple. Males and females look alike, although males are slightly larger.</p><h2>Caring for the Dove </h2><p>Beautiful, charming, and easy to care for, doves make excellent pets for those who are interested in owning a pet birdbut don't quite feel ready to take on a more difficult bird, such as a parrot. Doves are very common pets, and it is worth checking with rescue organizations and animal adoption agencies. These birds breed so readily in captivity that orphaned birds are frequently available. Doves are also easily found in specialty aviary pet stores and from breeders.</p><p>Noted for their gentle dispositions and quiet, soothing vocalizations, a dove is an excellent choice as a pet for both young and older bird lovers. Like any pet bird, a dove does require plenty of attention and socialization, but this bird is more naturally suited to interacting with humans than some other birdspecies,and novice bird owners generally find it easy to train and bond with a dove. While doves don't typically display the comical antics of the hookbill species, they have charming personalities and with proper care can offer their owners many years of entertainment, love, and companionship.</p><p>Doves can be kept indoors or outdoors. A single bird requires an indoor cage at least 24 inches square and 30 inches in height, although bigger is always better. If you are raising a pair of doves, an indoor flight cage that is 62 inches high, and about 32 inches square is suitable. Doves spend a lot of time on the ground, so a cage with a non-wire bottom is best. Equip the cage with a couple of perches to encourage flying between them.</p><p>If kept outdoors, a custom aviary must be sturdy enough to keep predators out and must have shelter to protect the birds from the elements. If keeping more than two birds, it's recommended that the aviary provides about four square feet of floor space for each bird.</p><p>Doves need companionship, and if kept alone indoors, they should be allowed plenty of free flight time out of the cage to interact with human caretakers. This bird does not require a lot of toys, but swings and mirrors within the cage are a good idea.</p><p>Doves need considerable exposure to ultraviolet light provided by direct sunlight, which is not provided by sunlight filtered by glass. Birds kept indoors will likely need supplemental lighting provided by UV lights in order to avoid vitamin D deficiency.</p><h2>Feeding the Dove </h2><p>In the wild, most dove species subsist on a diet comprised mainly of fruits, berries, and seeds. Some species have been known to ingest the occasional insect, but most doves thrive on a vegetarian diet. Pet doves in captivity seem to do best on a high-quality seed mix (often marketed as a diet safe for doves, pigeons, or parakeets) supplemented with millet, commercial pellets formulated for softbills, and a variety offresh, bird-safe fruits and vegetables.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Doves are not chewing birds, so they do not require a lot of toys. They do, however, require plenty of free flight time for exercise. If kept outdoors, make sure the aviary is large enough to provide flight space. If kept indoors, your bird should be allowed several hours of out-of-cage flight time in a safe environment (makes sure they can't escape).</p><h2>Common Health Issues </h2><p>Doves are prone to infection from the parasitecommonly known as . Symptoms include discoloration or sores around the mouth, and sometimes diarrhea. It can be treated with anti-parasite medications and can be prevented with good hygiene and regular cleaning of cages.</p><p>Doves that do not receive enough direct sunlight are prone to vitamin D deficiency. Birds kept indoors should be supplemented with UV lighting.</p>",974

If you're looking for chatty companions, pet birds may be for you. Here is a list of the seven best pet bird species for senior owners.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>So many caretakers have noted success in using small pet bird species that retirement communities and nursing homes have been studying the benefits of animal companionship with programs such as The Eden Project.</p><h2>Canaries</h2><p>Canaries are sweet, colorful little birds whose soft songs are known the world over for producing feelings of calm and serenity. Not only are they small and easy to care for, but they are also tons of fun to watch and don't require excessive amounts of attention from owners. They are popular pets in settings where owners and even patients can watch and hear them without having to get too physically involved in their care. Canaries can live for up to 10 years in captivity, making them an excellent choice as a companion for older people who are residents in long-term care situations.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 1/2 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright yellow, whitish, or reddish body</p><h2>Zebra Finches</h2><p>Zebra Finches are very social and need to be kept in small flocks of three to four birds in order to thrive, but this only adds to the joy of watching them interact with each other. Their sweet, quiet vocalizations are very pleasant to listen to, and people often enjoy watching them flit about. Some people allow out-of-cage flight time for finches, but it is not at all required so they are a great choice for a person who would benefit from just sitting near them throughout the day. They require minimal human attention otherwise, so they are a great species to keep from a nursing/caretaker standpoint. These birds would be best in a home that has space to allow for a rather large flight cage.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 1/2 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright yellow, whitish, or reddish body</p><h2>Budgies (Parakeets)</h2><p>Perhaps the most popular small bird species, the budgie or parakeet is a small, colorful parrot species with an enormous amount of personality for their size. Because budgies are parrots, they require more human interaction than the finches, so they would do best in a situation where someone can play and interact with them directly for at least an hour per day. These beautiful birds are very vocal but lack the ability to scream like many other parrot species, which has made them a popular choice, but they can learn to be proficient talkers. Budgies are recommended for owners who are fairly mobile and able to spend time socializing and playing with their bird out-of-cage.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Light green body with black wing markings and yellow head; captive-bred colors of blue, gray, green, white, violet, yellow/blue</p><h2>Cockatiels</h2><p>These medium-sized birds are an interactive delight. Members of the parrot family, these Australian natives are known for their advanced whistling and singing abilities. While cockatiels are capable of learning to talk, these birds often prefer to whistle and to mimic household sounds such as the ringing of a telephone. These birds are available in increasingly diverse color combinations.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 2.5 to 3.5 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Light gray body with long, dark gray tail, yellow and gray crest, yellow face; orange ear patch and white on the wing; dark gray bill</p><h2>Parrotlets</h2><p>Hailing from Mexico, this is the smallest of all pet parrots. With the personality of the big macaws, parrotlets can be sassy little companions for seniors. Active, but not overly squawky, these birds do well in apartments or homes with noise-sensitive neighbors. These birds enjoy hiding in shirt pockets or scarves or riding around on shoulders, and they even know their own names. When not handled often enough, they can be nippy and aggressive, but when appropriately socialized and kept alone, they do very well bonding with humans of any age. Parrotlets can live up to 30 years and may outlive an elderly owner so consider rescuing an older bird who needs a home.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body or one of manycolor mutations, such as lutino, blue, and albino; tiny tails, zygodactyl feet: two forward-pointing toes and two rear-pointing toes</p><h2>Doves </h2><p>Doves (or pigeons) are known for their sweet and gentle dispositions. Unlike the hard-beaked hookbill parrots,softbill doves rarely try to bite or do damage with their softer beaks. Still, it always helps to use calm, positive socialization andbondingtechniques with these birds. Doves can be a good match for gentle owners, but doves need bird companionship too, so they do best in pairs. Mirrors and swings inside a dove's enclosure increase fun activity for the birds, and they should be allowed free-flight time out of the cage to interact with human caretakers as well.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 8 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Pure white, gray, white with gray, tangerine, pied, and orange; black eyes, black bill, dark purple feet</p><h2>Lovebirds</h2><p>Even in pairs or small groups, lovebirds chatter in a quiet way, making them a match for those who live in apartments or condominiums. Even though they are fairly quiet companions, they are known to be assertive and can be nippy. These colorful little birds possess all the intelligence and personality of the largest of macaws so they may be opinionated.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly green, orange upper body and head, blue lower back and rump, red beak, white eyerings</p><p>For seniors owners, care may have to be shared sometimes with friends and neighbors while the owner is away. Avoid choosing species that stick to strict pecking orders in the flock; these birds may hassle a temporary caregiver. Choose a bird likely to be happy to chat with anyone, not just the person they have bonded with most closely.</p>",1003

Named for Alexander the Great, who is said to have had many of these birds, it was an exotic pet owned by nobility and the elite. This medium-sized parrot is the largest of the Asiatic parakeets. It is an affectionate bird that tends to be a one-person bird, forming deep bonds with its human keeper.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Alexandrine parakeet, Alexandrine parrot</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 25 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 40 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>This species originated in India and Sri Lanka.

Feral populations currently live in Spain, England, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Turkey, the Arabian peninsula, Iran, and Hong Kong.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Tame, handfed Alexandrine parakeets can make loving and affectionate pets, although they tend to become ""one-person"" birds. They strongly bond to a favorite family member while shunning others within the household.</p><p>Like other Asiatic parakeets, many Alexandrine parakeets go through a hormonal, aggressive bluffing phase during adolescence (age 4 months to 1 year), which can be difficult for less seasoned bird owners to handle. This period can last from two weeks to two years, depending on the bird.</p><p>With proper socialization and the use of bonding techniques, Alexandrine parakeets generally settle nicely into their new home environment and thoroughly enjoy interacting with their owners. These birds are highly intelligent and are known to be excellent talkers, making them very popular pets.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Alexandrine parakeets can be quite noisy and loud, so they are probably not the right choice for those who live near neighbors. Their powerful vocalizations carry over a long distance in the wild, so it can be challenging to keep one in an apartment or condominium setting.</p><p>This bird has an excellent capacity for imitating human speech clearly. The Alexandrine parakeet has a variety of calls, including ringing sounds, loud and deep ""klak"" sounds, and a resounding ""gr-aak"" call. Its calls are deeper than the Indian ringneck parakeets, and it's alarm calls are louder, too.</p><h2>Alexandrine Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Slender Alexandrines can reach a length of 25 inches, and most of this length is due to its long, elegant tail feathers. They are slightly more stocky than Indian Ringneck parakeets.</p><p>Coloring is predominantly green with blue-grey on the cheeks and back of the neck, yellow-greenabdomen, red patch on the shoulders, a massive redbeakwith yellow tips. The underside of the tail is yellow; the top of the tail is green and blue with yellow at the tip.</p><p>Alexandrine parakeets are a dimorphic bird species, meaning you can tell males apart from females. Adult males have a black and rose-colored ring around their necks. Females are the same color without the neck rings.</p><h2>Caring for an Alexandrine Parakeet </h2><p>Known for their beauty, intelligence, and excellent talking abilities, Alexandrine parakeets need a lot of space, hours of interaction, and supervised out-of-cage time every day. Care for this bird can be a decades-long commitment.</p><p>This bird may be a medium-sized parrot, but it still needs a large cage to accommodate its long tail feathers. At the minimum, provide a cage that is at least 3 feet tall and 2 feet long and wide.</p><p>These birds love to bathe frequently and play in the water.Provide a large water bath at least once a week. Your bird might also like an occasional misting.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Most pet Alexandrine parakeets do well on a diet consisting of fresh vegetables, leafy greens, grains, some healthy seed, tree nuts, and a high-quality, commercially-made, formulated pelleted diet. Fresh vegetables are the cornerstone of a good diet for parrots.</p><p>Offer your bird 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pellets and 1/4 to 1/2 cup of fruits and vegetables daily. Increase or decrease the amount according to your bird's appetite. Remove the uneaten foods to prevent spoilage.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Alexandrine parakeets are very active birds. They need plenty of exercise to maintain their physical and emotional health. A large flight cage is preferable for these birds. They need space to be able to move around without damaging their long, beautiful tail feathers.</p><p>These birds require a minimum of 3 to 4 hours a day to stretch, play, and exercise outside of its cage. Supervised playtime needs to be in a safe, ""bird-proof"" area. Alexandrines are very curious and can get into trouble if left to roam unattended. These intelligent birds get bored quickly, so provide plenty of chewable, bird-safe toys.</p><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Intelligent, can learn to speak</p><p>Can be loud, not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Can become one-person birds and territorial with others</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Alexandrine Parakeet </h2><p>Contact local adoption and rescue organizations to see if there is one that might be for you and spend some time with them and their birds. Observe how the birds interact with their caregivers and other family members.</p><p>Alexandrine parakeets can cost from $500 to $1,500.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that thebreeder is reputableby asking them how long they've been breeding and working with Alexandrine parakeets. Also, make sure that the bird you want to take home is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",905

25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/no-such-thing-as-starter-bird-390226,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>Buying Your First Pet Bird Needs Research and Education Ahead of Time</h1>,"<h1>Buying Your First Pet Bird Needs Research and Education Ahead of Time</h1><p>The thought of bringing your first bird into your home is an exciting one if a little daunting. Birds can be fun and engaging companions, but remember that you must also become the companion to your bird.</p><p>Birds require the same basic care as any pet. Like all animals, birds need clean water and the whole foods that give them proper nutrition. (Birds use bits of fine gravel to aid their gizzards in grinding hard seeds and husks.) But they also need their own safe enclosure, frequent socializing, and an owner who knows their specific requirements as no two birds species are exactly alike.</p><h2>A Bird's Cage and Your Home </h2><p>A bird's cage is a safe, spacious home, large enough so that it can move freely to stretch its wings and perform the acrobatics and strengthening to stay healthy both emotionally and physically. Placement of the cage in an active living area is better than in a back bedroom as frequent traffic promotes socialization.</p><p>Birds need daylight for energy and mood elevation, but they also need quiet and dark at times of rest and sleep. Because they naturally roost in areas under tree canopy cover, all birds must always have the choice of getting out of the direct sun, heat, or dry air. Birds will seek out cooler, shady areas at will.</p><p>Before a bird can be let outside of its cage, the entire room area needs to be made bird-safe. Electric wires are chewing hazards so hide them well or cover them with insulation. Windows and doorways are exit hazards, so make sure there are secondary doors to be a final boundary. Glass doors are non-obvious impact hazards, so make sure to leave them open.</p><p>Consider all potential high and low flight pathways, and note that birds often like to follow their owners from room to room. Be careful not to shut inside doors behind you when a bird is in your living space or you might hear a thud on the other side of the door. All house plants also need to be non-toxic to birds.</p><h2>Social Needs </h2><p>Many bird species only feel comfortable when they are grouped together with their own kind. Keeping just one single parakeet, canary, or parrot may result in a depressed bird that does not sing or move around much to stay healthy. Solitary birds often become depressed or anxious, just like people do.</p><p>The most commonly overlooked aspect to consider about social bonding in birds is how long the relationship could last. Some pet bird species have a lifespan that is even longer than humans, at 100 years, and many birds reach the age of 70 or 80 years. Having so many complex social relationships over time, birds have acquired a ""pecking order,"" so your bird may prefer some members of your family more than others.</p><p>If your plan is to have only one bird, you must commit to daily one-on-one sessions of bird handling, just like petting your cat or taking your dog for walks. A lone bird will benefit greatly from being let out of his cage daily to cuddle or sit on your shoulder or even to play inside your safe houseplants. Happy birds love to sing and look out of windows for outside birds; some even like to mimic human talking. Many birds even to learn the meanings of many words.</p><h2>Researching Birds </h2><p>Learn about their specific nutritional needs, behavior in the wild, and their requirements for attention. Consider the practicalities of having such a bird in your home. Do you have the room? Do youhave the time for the attention these birds need? Do you have neighbors living close by? Some birds are notoriously loud, and neighbors could be upset by loud screeching in the morning or evening.</p><p>Note that some pet birds are incredibly intelligent. Investigate the work of Dr. Irene Pepperberg and her work with African Greys. Grey parrots are relatively plain looking and might be overlooked if you don't know that they are smart parrots. However, these birds might be difficult to keep occupied at the level that their brains need.</p><h2>Get to Know Many Birds Before You Buy </h2><p>First and foremost, spend some real time in the presence of birds. Visit zoos, aviaries, and pet stores. Read up on the necessary behavior training you would have to learn to provide for each one.</p><p>Notice whether feathers or the smells of birds bother you; you may have an allergy you don't yet know about. Decide if the high-pitched sounds that birds make will be ok with your family or those within earshot. You may even find a bird club in your community to get to know some experienced bird owners who will tell you what daily life with a bird entails.</p><h2>Little Size or Big Size Birds? </h2><p>Little birds are charming and have so much to offer, and they make delightful companions. The smaller bird species are just as loving and communicative as larger species although their equipment requirements may be less expensive.</p><p>For larger birds, the added expense of much bigger equipment should not be overlooked. Their noises are louder and their beak bites can be considerable. However, these are not necessarily reasons to avoid larger birds.</p><h2>Consider a Bird's Welfare First </h2><p>To help the birds, consider adopting individuals that desperately need a good home. Illegal trafficking in wild birds leaves many in need of a home, and then there are the many birds that simply have outlived their owners. If you are interested in rescue, talk to your local veterinarians as well, as they may know a bird already in your area that is looking for a new home.</p><p>Buying a bird based on its color or grandeur can be a big mistake because all birds need the same TLC as any pet. Be fully informed about the kind of a commitment you are making  you make your final decision.</p>",984
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bathing-your-bird-390665,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>How to Give Your Pet Bird a Bath</h1>,"<h1>How to Give Your Pet Bird a Bath</h1><p>New bird owners often have questions about the proper ways to bathe their birds. The truth is, there are a few right answers.</p><p>Every bird is an individual, and as such, will display unique characteristics in regards to grooming behavior. Some birds love to play in the water and relish their time in the bath. Some birds have not been conditioned to accept bathing and resist contact with water despite the fact that showers would be a part of their natural grooming activity in the wild.</p><p>While at times it can take some effort on the part of the owner to single out the grooming methods that will work for a particular bird, bathing is important to a bird's health and even reluctant birds should be exposed to different types of showering options and choose which one they will accept.</p><h2>The Rules of Bathing </h2><p>If you always follow these simple rules of bathing, you can ensure that bath time for your pet will be a safe activity, no matter which bathing techniques you may choose.</p><h2>4 Ways to Give a Bird a Bath </h2><p>There are a few different bathing options that owners can try to figure out what their bird will enjoy. The most important variables in effective bathing are frequency and method. By ""experimenting"" with these aspects, you are sure to stumble across the right combination for your feathered friend.</p><p>Birds vary greatly in the ways that they choose to bathe. Some birds love the feeling of a trickling shower, some prefer to stand in a fine mist, and some like to dunk themselves in a pool of water. Try the following techniques at home with your pet to see which works the best for him.</p><h3>Shower Together </h3><p>Being naturally social creatures, birds often enjoy taking a shower with their owners. There are even various avian shower products available such as special shower perches and sprayers. If you choose to introduce your pet to the shower, it's best to do so with extreme patience at first. Allow your bird to watch you in the shower before attempting to convince him to join you. He should decide on his own that the shower is a friendly thing, and poses no threat to his safety. Placing your bird on the shower railing, bird specific shower perch, or sometimes the bottom of the shower/tub is a great way to get them introduced to showering. You can take it from there!</p><h3>Mist With Water </h3><p>A fine mist from a clean spray bottle is the method of choice for some birds. Many pet bird species originate from extremely warm and humid climates, and the spray helps to rehydrate their nasal cavities as well as clean their feathers. If you think your bird might benefit from a quick spritz, be sure to use pure warm water in a clean new spray bottle. This ensures that there are no chemical residues that could be toxic to your pet. You can purchas a continuous spray bottle to have a steady stream of mist to provide your pet.</p><h3>Dip in the Sink </h3><p>Many birds like to dip themselves into a pool of still water. Try pooling a bit of warm water in your sink and having your bird step down into it. Chances are that your bird's natural bathing instincts will take over from there, and he will be happily splashing about in no time. Some birds prefer a small stream of water going into the pool below to help stimulate them to bath as well; watch the water level, though. It can reach a high level quickly and may need to be drained so your bird doesn't get soaked. If you own a small bird that is reluctant to stand in the sink, try cupping warm water in the palms of your hands as your pet perches on the side of your thumb. Many times a bird will feel safer bathing in his owner's handsand this can also be a great bonding experience.</p><h3>Offer Wet Lettuce Leaves </h3><p>Smaller birds sometimes enjoy rolling around on wet produce leaves. Simply wet the leaves of swiss chard, kale, or other types of produce and place them on the floor of the enclosure or on a shallow plate or bowl. They might enjoy contact with the leaves and get the water on their feathers which will get the loose dander and dust off of them.</p><p>If you observe your bird's reactions to these different techniques, it should be relatively easy to identify the one that your bird enjoys most. This, however, is only half of the ""bird bathing equation."" Deciding how often your bird should be bathed is the next step in achieving grooming greatness.</p><h2>How Often to Give a Bird a Bath </h2><p>As with the different methods of bathing, how often a bird needs to be bathed often comes down to each bird's unique preference. While a good rule of thumb is to offer your bird a bath once a week, many birds will desire the opportunity to clean up more or less frequently.</p><p>By building a grooming routine around your bird's natural preferences, you will makebath timea smoother and much more enjoyable experience for your pet. Pay attention to your bird's reaction to various bathing techniques, and stick with the ones that work best for both of you. Enjoy the time that you spend grooming your pet, and make it obvious to your bird that you view bathing as a positive experience. The end result will be a happy, healthy, squeaky clean, and beautiful companion and whatbird ownercould ask for anything more?</p>",928
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/most-intelligent-bird-species-390533,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>8 Most Intelligent Pet Parrot Species</h1>,"<h1>8 Most Intelligent Pet Parrot Species</h1><p>The term ""bird brain"" is often used to describe someone who is a little bit less than bright, and yet this commonly used phrase couldn't be farther from the truth. Birds are some of the most intelligent creatures on Earth, and birds in captivity continue to prove this to us time and time again. If you are interested in owning a pet bird with superior intelligence, then begin your search with these incredibly precocious species. Here is a look at eight of the most intelligent types of pet birds.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Harvard professor Dr. Irene Pepperberg studied Alex, the African Gray parrot, and other African Grays for many years. Her findings regarding cognition and intelligence in African Gray parrots changed the course of the study of linguistics and animal cognition. Dr. Pepperberg has also published books about her long relationships with these communicative birds.</p><h2>African Gray Parrot</h2><p>Kept as cherished companions for centuries, it's no secret that the African Gray parrot is regarded as one of the most intelligent bird species on the planet. In fact, testing concludes that African Grays have intellects on par with human children! They have been found to be unusually adept at shape recognition, color identification, and the null concept, the idea of zero or none. Grays can be taught a myriad of communication games that will strengthen the bond.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 15 to 18 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Varying shades of gray on the body; red tail feathers</p><h2>Macaw</h2><p>The beautiful and captivating Macaw is indeed an intelligent bird. They often wow crowds with their remarkable ability to mimic speech and perform complex tricks. There are also smaller Macaws, such as the Yellow-Collared, Hahns, and Severe Macaws that are less recognized, but they share the personality and intellect of their larger counterparts. Bigger is not necessarily better in terms of what these birds have to offer.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length:  40 inches; half the total body length in the tail feathers</p><p>Weight: 42 to 50 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics:Deep shade of solid blue on the body; bright yellow patches around the eyes and lower beak</p><h2>Amazon Parrot</h2><p>Another genus of birds that all share equal intellectual capabilities is the intriguing Amazon parrot. Due to their supreme intelligence and talking ability, Amazon parrots have been kept as pets for many hundreds of years. Some Amazons learn to mimic speech so exactly that their words can barely be discerned from those of an actual human. In addition to speech, Amazon parrots can be trained to perform a variety of complex tricks and tasks.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 7 to 25 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body feathers; over 15 species of Amazon parrot with different head colorings</p><h2>Cockatoo</h2><p>Known more for their endearing personalities than for their speaking abilities, Cockatoos are another type of bird that scores exceptionally high on intelligence tests.Bonding is so strong that leaving these birds alone often creates anxiety. Cockatoos should learn to play with toys on their own, so reasonable limits must be set on socializing. Learning to occupy themselves during times when you cannot entertain them will prevent over bonding and learned dependency.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 14 to 28 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly white body; some yellow feathers underneath the wings; reddish eyes in females, brown to black eyes in males</p><h2>Eclectus Parrot</h2><p>The eye-catching Eclectus parrot is no slouch when it comes to brains. Like the other species discussed here, when properly trained using positive reinforcement techniques, they can be taught to talk, perform tricks, and perform tasks that make them excellent companions. Consider an Eclectus if you want to form a strong bond with a smaller pet bird that still loves socialization and playtime with its owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 12 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body with blue and red, yellow on the head (male); red body with purple, blue and some yellow (female)</p><h2>Budgie</h2><p>Budgerigars or Budgies pack a ton of intelligence, trainability, and personality into a tiny package. Not only can Budgies learn to talk as well as the larger parrots, but they can also be trained to perform a number of fun tricks that never fail to impress. They do, however, require a long-term commitment from their owners, just as with the larger birds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length:  7 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Light green body with black wing markings and yellow head; captive-bred colors include blue, gray, green, white, violet, yellow/blue</p><h2>Indian Ringneck Parrot</h2><p>While the Indian Ringneck parrot or parakeetis not an expert at mimicking the human voice, this bird uses its own bird voice to capture mood and sentiment. Individuals have also been known to learn up to 250 words. When wild Ringnecks learned to mimic the prayers of Indian monks in sacred gardens, they became revered as mystical birds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 16 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 6 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright green body; red and black neck ring (male); no ring or a pale shadow (female)</p><h2>Monk Parakeet</h2><p>The Monk Parakeet or Quaker Parakeet is actually a small parrot. It is well known for its ability to build a large vocabulary of words and phrases. The more you verbally explain what you are doing around the cage, the more this bird will pick up on the names for things and learn how to mimics those words. Most Quakers develop a great vocabulary and can even put together multiple phrases to get their point across. Mimicking room sounds and singing are additional talents. Often referred to as little clowns, they can be sassy; this just plays into their spunky character.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Breeding for pale green, white, or blue, and yellow; orange beaks</p>",931
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-ducks-5195035,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Keeping a Duck as a Pet</h1>,"<h1>Everything You Need to Know About Keeping a Duck as a Pet</h1><h2>Characteristics, Housing, Diet, and Other Information</h2><p>Chickens are popular backyard pets but ducks have many of the same characteristics. This has led to these waterfowl being cared for not only for their feathers, meat, and eggs, but also simply as pets. There are a variety of breeds of ducks, and some make better pets than others, but they all have similar care requirements. Housing, food and water, zoning restrictions, and health concerns should all be taken into consideration prior to purchasing a pet duck. But if you are properly prepared for one, you'll be rewarded with several years with your feathered friend.</p><h2>Pet Duck Breeds </h2><p>There are several different breeds of ducks that are kept as pets.</p><p>Some of these duck breeds are also raised for their meat, feathers, or eggs but many are just kept as long-lived outdoor pets since most duck breeds live to be about ten years of age.</p><h2>Duck Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Some ducks, like Pekin ducks, can be very friendly and calm while others are known to be more active and noisy. If noise is a concern, be sure to choose a breed that isn't too talkative but otherwise sleeping, grazing, and swimming will consume most of your duck's day.</p><p>Ducks, like other birds, also do best in groups and will be friendlier if they are hand-tamed at a young age. Most ducks are not aggressive, unless they are nesting or are guarding their young, so while a duck is more likely to run away than bite if it is scared, that doesn't mean socialization isn't important. Ducks may not have teeth but they do have beaks that can hurt if they bite.</p><h2>Housing Ducks </h2><p>Ducks are outdoor pets but they can still benefit from secure housing. Plenty of space to roam and swim should be provided during the day but at night, during inclement weather, or if predators are at large, a shelter is needed to help keep your ducks safe. A shed, large dog house, altered chicken coop, or a house specifically designed and sold for ducks should be accessible to your feathered fowl at all times. About four square feet of coop floor space is adequate for one duck so if you have multiple ducks, a large coop or multiple coops may be needed.</p><p>Ducks do not perch so perches in your duck's house are not necessary like they are for chickens, but they should have clean bedding to walk and lie on. Ducks produce a lot of feces so regular cleaning is a must. Straw is best but pine needles or wood shavings can also be spread on the floor of your duck's house. Wire floor grates can cause injuries and unclean bedding can create health concerns, so the flooring in your duck's house is very important.</p><p>If your ducks are not free-range in your yard or on your farm, wired fencing should be attached to the coop to keep them contained. Each duck should have at least 15 square feet of land to roam so the amount of space you'll need to secure within this fencing will depend on how many ducks you have.</p><h2>Food and Water </h2><p>Ducks are omnivores so that means pet ducks should eat a variety of foods. A commercially available, pelleted duck food should be the base of any pet duck's diet since it is complete and balanced, but vegetables and insects can also be provided as treats. Leafy greens, earthworms, mealworms, green peas, corn kernels, and other items are healthy additives to your duck's daily meals.</p><p>In addition to having pellets available in a feeder or shallow dish, fresh drinking water should also be provided. A duck waterer should be cleaned regularly and kept full since ducks drink at least one liter of water a day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Ducks are fairly healthy pets but they can still develop issues.</p><p>Stagnant water, dirty environments, inappropriate diets, consumption of toxins, and exposure to sick ducks are the primary causes of health problems in ducks. Thankfully, most of these things can be avoided by maintaining a clean coop and providing a proper diet for your pet duck.</p><h2>Is It Legal to Own a Pet Duck? </h2><p>Ducks are often considered farm animals and are not legal to own everywhere due to zoning restrictions. Not all towns and communities allow ducks, so you will need to check with the specific rules, regulations, and ordinances where you live prior to purchasing pet ducks. Wild ducks are not legal to own but domesticated ducks can be kept if where you live allows it. If livestock or poultry is allowed, you are probably allowed to own ducks, but there may be specific requirements for housing and when they are allowed to be outside of their coop.</p><h2>Purchasing Your Duck </h2><p>Since it is not legal to take a duck from the wild, you'll want to find a place where you can purchase a domesticated duck. Hatcheries sell ducklings that can be ordered online or purchased in-person but many feed stores and family farms will also sell ducks. Be sure to choose a duck that is active, has no eye or nose drainage, and has clean vent feathers to increase the likelihood of purchasing a healthy pet.</p>",881
29,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-tell-if-bird-is-sick-390399,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Sickness in Pet Birds</h1>,"<h1>Sickness in Pet Birds</h1><p>Many new bird owners may not know the symptoms of bird sickness, and birds are often good at hiding them. There are a few tell-tale signs you should watch for to have the best chance of saving your pet from a life-threatening ailment. If your bird exhibits any of these symptoms, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h2>Signs of Sickness </h2><p>Birds are sensitive and intelligent creatures. They are also usually creatures of habit. While they may try to hide their symptoms, paying close attention to their daily activities, behavior, and general attitude. Trust your gut. If you suspect something is off with your bird, it's better to speak to your vet before things get worse. As a bird owner, there are some common symptoms should all be on your radar.</p><h2>Bird Droppings </h2><p>It's not the most pleasant task to monitor your bird's droppings, but they can clearly show that something may be wrong. While the color of your bird's droppings may vary slightly depending on what you feed it, you should watch for droppings that are yellow, rusty brown, or tarry black.</p><p>These can be indicators of internal bleeding or other serious problems. Pay attention to any major changes in the consistency of your bird's droppings. Whether they're too runny or too firm, they can cause complications for your pet.</p><h2>Ruffled Feathers and Weight Loss </h2><p>Birds that sit with their feathers fluffed out for prolonged periods of time are often affected by respiratory problems or other disorders. Ruffled feathers may also conceal weight loss, which can be life-threatening for a bird. If you observe this behavior in your pet for more than a day or so, you should contact your vet as soon as possible.</p><p>Weight loss can be devastating to a bird's health, not only in terms of reducedstrengthbut inhibition of organ functions as well. Weigh your bird regularly so you'll know if your pet is having trouble maintaining its weight.</p><h2>Red, Inflamed, or Runny Cere or Eyes </h2><p>Your bird's cere is what you might perceive as its nose; it's the little patch above the beak that holds the nostrils. Pay close attention to your bird's cere. If you observe any redness, inflammation, or discharge, there's a good chance that your pet could be seriously ill. Make sure to keep your bird wrapped up and warm on the way to the vet. Likewise, If your bird's eyes look cloudy or there's a discharge coming from them, the bird could be affected by a respiratory, nervous, or muscular disorder.</p><h2>Reduced Appetite </h2><p>Birds have an extremely high metabolism, so it's vital that they receive adequate nutrition every day. If your bird stops eating and begins to lose weight, it may be a sign of an intestinal blockage or impaction, in which case it could die very quickly without medical attention. Make sure to clean out the bottom of your bird's cage every day before you feed it. This provides an easy way to monitor food consumption, as well as changes in droppings.</p><h2>Open-Mouthed Breathing </h2><p>Respiratory problems are among the most common bird sicknesses and, unfortunately, the most serious. If you see your bird breathing with its mouth open while it's at rest, there's a good chance that it's not onlysick but has been for quite a while. This requires immediate veterinary attention and may lead to hospitalization.</p><h2>Dirty Feathers </h2><p>Birds are, by nature, hygienic animals that bathe frequently and preen their feathers daily to keep them clean. If you notice feathers around your bird's face or rump that appear messy or stuck together, it's an indication that your pet could be sick. Monitor the bird's food consumption and droppings closely for a day or so, note any changes, and relay this information to your vet.</p><h2>Tail Bobbing </h2><p>As with many common signs of illness in birds, prolonged, repetitivebobbing of the tailcan indicate a respiratory infection. Unlike people, birds lack a diaphragm that separates the chest cavity from the stomach. The muscles located at the base of the tail help birds breathe by playing a part in expanding their lungs for air intake.</p><p>If a bird is having trouble breathing, the tail muscles work harder, causing the tail to bob up and down. Tail bobbing is often not noticeable until later, more serious stages of illness, so if you see your bird behaving in this manner, call the vet immediately.</p><h2>Changes in Vocalization </h2><p>Much like humans, birds that don't feel well often become less talkative than usual. Pay close attention to your bird so that you can learn its normal vocalization patterns. Stay in tune with the way your bird behaves, so you can pick up clues as to the way it feels. If you notice any changes in the frequency or general tone of your bird's vocalizations, monitor it for additional symptoms over the next few days.</p><h2>Treatment and Prevention </h2><p>When it comes to your pet bird's health, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Birds have very delicate systems, and even a minor illness can turn into a serious threat in the blink of an eye. Early diagnosis can be vital to saving a sick bird's life.</p><p>Your bird depends on you tomaintain its good health. Make sure to keep tabs on its behavior so that you can keep your little friend around for a long time.</p>",910
30,https://www.thesprucepets.com/introducing-new-bird-to-your-parrot-390234,Parrots & Pet Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Bird Adoption,<h1>Introducing a New Bird to Your Parrot</h1>,"<h1>Introducing a New Bird to Your Parrot</h1><p>You are not alone if you already own a parrot and are thinking about adding another bird to your family. Many bird owners eventually decide to adopt multiple feathered friends once they find how enjoyable one is to have around.</p><p>Parrots are notorious for being finicky creatures of habit and adding a new bird to your home can easily create stress in your existing pet. To ease any resistance and make the transition as smooth as possible, there are a few steps you can take to introduce the two birds. By doing it properly, you can show your bird that your new pet is a friend rather than foe.</p><h2>Quarantine the New Bird </h2><p>A rule of thumb among most pet bird owners is that a new bird should be quarantined for a period of time before introducing it to parrots that you already have. This accomplishes two important things: It keeps your bird safe and gives it time to adjust to the new bird's presence.</p><p>Quarantine significantly reduces the risk that your new bird could pass on any contagious diseases to your existing pet. Keeping the new arrival in a separate area not only protects your parrot from any airborne illnesses, but it also allows you time to safely observe the bird for any outward signs of sickness.</p><p>At the same time, your parrot will have a chance to hear the new bird's call. It will become accustomed to the bird's voice and presence over time. Direct interaction too soon can be seen as intimidating or a breach of your bird's established territory.</p><h2>Slowly Move the Birds Closer </h2><p>Once the quarantine period is over, it remains important to slowly introduce your birds to each other. Even parrots of the same species may not necessarily become the best of friends right away. Often, one of the birds will attempt to assert dominance over the other, and this can result in nasty fights if you aren't very careful.</p><p>To help your birds get to know each other slowly, move your new bird's cage into the room where your older bird's cage resides. Allow them to observe each other from a distance for several days. As they become used to each other, you'll be able to identify signs that they are becoming more comfortable with being closer together. During this time, remain patient and don't push either birds' limits.</p><h2>Make a Peace Offering </h2><p>Sometimes it is helpful to bribe your birds into getting along. One of the easiest ways is to get each bird to form positive associations with the other by offering treats. The ideal time to begin is toward the end of the quarantine stage.</p><p>When you're ready for the birds to see each other, simply bring your new bird's cage into the room. Offer both birds several tasty treats while they are in the same room together. After a few minutes, move the new bird's cage back to the quarantine area, and repeat the process later.</p><p>It's important to leave both birds in their cages during this introductory phase. Otherwise, fights and injuries can occur if the uncaged bird charges the territory of the one that's behind bars.</p><h2>Practice Bonding Techniques </h2><p>The later phases of introducing a new bird are a great time to start practicing bond-building techniques with both birds. Simple things like sharing food, grooming, and playing can greatly enhance your relationship with both of your feathered friends.</p><p>When you feel that your birds are ready, let them watch you interact with each other from their separate cages. While it's possible that some older birds may exhibit jealous behaviors, it may make others more willing to accept the new bird as a flock member.</p><h2>Try Trick Training </h2><p>Even when your birds are comfortable playing in the same room out of their cages, it may take some time before they are actually ready to play together. A good way to speed the process along is to try some trick training with both of your pets. Your birds will get plenty of positive reinforcement from all the yummy treats they earn during their joint training session. Additionally, you will be building a stronger sense of companionship by interacting with each other like a flock.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>If at any time during the introductions you notice either bird becoming uncomfortable, take a step back. Remember that birds can be touchy and one of your birds may not be ready to move as fast as you like. Move more slowly or go to the previous step and don't proceed until your birds fully accept that part of the process. It will take longer for some birds than others, so it's important to follow your bird's lead.</p><p>It's possible that your parrot will never accept a new bird. Be prepared to make alternative arrangements if needed. This may mean you will always have to keep the birds in separate rooms and ensure the door is closed whenever one bird is out of its cage.</p><p>Unfortunately, if you cannot find harmony in the home at all, it may be best to consider finding a new home for the new bird. Some birds are simply better off being the only pet and making this difficult decision may be what's best for both birds.</p>",879

33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-i-train-a-pet-bird-to-like-being-petted-1238418,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Train Your Bird to Allow Petting</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Bird to Allow Petting</h1><h2>It will take patience and a fair amount of coaxing</h2><p>Getting your bird to accept you petting it is more about being in tune with your bird and learning to work with its personality than it is about training. A bird's comfort level with people can vary greatly, and some just like their personal space. If you have a bird that does not like to be touched, you will need to learn how to approach it in order to make it comfortable with contact.</p><p>If you have a cuddly bird that likes human contact, it probably won't take much effort at all to get your bird lowering its head to get you to scratch it. Some birds, such as parrots and budgies are more likely to allow touching than others. But even within bird species, there are different personalities.</p><p>You can do a little bit of training to get your bird more comfortable with the idea of petting. As with other forms of training, practice the behavior with short, frequent sessions, and don't press on if your bird is cranky or grows tired. You can always try again another day.</p><h2>Learn Your Bird's Cues </h2><p>Whentraining your bird to accept petting, the first step is to read the cues your bird is giving you.</p><p>Does your bird assume a stiff posture and stare at you when you approach it? Does it run away, try to push you away, or even try to bite you? These are clear signs that your bird is not comfortable with what is happening. Owners may find that reaching for the bird's head to pet it may be perceived as a threat, especially if you try to reach the back of the head. If you ignore the body language of a stressed bird,prepare for a potential bite from them.</p><p>If you ignore the body language of a stressed bird, they will start to have a negative association with fingers, which might cause them to get nervous or stressed every time a finger comes near them.</p><p>A bird that likes being pet, however, is relaxed and will often turn its head a bit to the side, or even bow its head down, for scratches and petting. Some will bow their heads down and even close their eyes, a sign of a happy bird that fully trusts that petting is not a threat. Some birds will fluff up their head feathers when they see a finger approaching and if they want to be pet.</p><h2>Strategically Start Your Training Time </h2><p>To begin your training, choose a quiet time when your bird is relaxed, after eating or just before its usual bedtime. Keep your hand in full view of yourbird, and speak to it before petting it. Don't try to force it; if the bird resists, take a break.</p><h2>Begin With the Beak </h2><p>Try lightly touching and petting your bird's beak at first. Be careful not to poke its eyes, and be prepared for it to try to nip you (more of a threat from a larger bird, obviously). If your bird lets you touch itsbeak, try gradually moving your fingers to the skin on its face just behind the beak. Work your way around the side of your bird'shead if it is comfortable with you petting its beak and face.</p><h2>Move to the Body </h2><p>If you can move the bird's body, work with the natural orientation of the feathers. Petting the feathers against the grain can be irritating for the bird. Pet in the direction the feathers naturally lay down, or gently scratch side to side between the feathers. Eventually, as yourbird relaxes, you can work your way around to the back of its head and neck. Try not to pet these areas very often.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>If your bird is slow to take to petting, don't give up. Take small steps and continue to practice. Even just showing your hands in front of your bird is a beneficial step to continue to practice and will get the bird comfortable with your hands. While a good cuddle might be nice for you and your bird, it is a good idea to avoid excessive petting and to avoid petting the back and body of your bird. A mature bird may find petting in these areas stimulating which may result in a sexually frustrated bird and, in turn, may lead to behavior issues.</p><p>A common mistake for bird owners is that petting becomes the only way you interact with your bird. Birds need socialization in many other ways. Take part in tricks, games, exploring, toys, talking, or just being together. Your bird will benefit greatly from these interactions. You can also offer a seed in your fingers to the bird in its cage or outside of its cage until it isn't scared.</p><p>Ultimately, if your bird does not respond to your attempts to pet it, you may just have to accept that it's not a cuddly bird and be content with admiring it and caring for it from afar (or, from a short distance). Persisting in petting a bird that just doesn't like contact is going to erode your bird's trust in other areas and may cause harm to the relationship.</p>",865

The good news is there are still plenty of slightly smaller parrots out there. Medium-sized parrots are full of personality, and many species can learn to talk or perform tricks just like their large parrot cousins. They also can form close bonds with their caretakers. Here are eight medium parrot species that make excellent pets.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Regardless of your pet bird's size, it's recommended to provide it with as large of an enclosure as you can fit and afford. Also, give your bird as much out-of-cage exercise as possible.</p><h2>Cockatiel</h2><p>Cockatiels can be very affectionate pets, especially when they've been hand-raised, and they are intelligent birds that can be taught to do many tricks. Although most cockatiels don't talk, they can learn to mimic sounds, such as whistles, doorbells, and telephone rings. But they don't tend to be as loud as some other parrot species, making them a good choice for apartment living.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Gray body; yellow face and crest; orange cheeks; long tail; mutations include albino, lutino, pied, and cinnamon</p><h2>Quaker Parrot</h2><p>Quaker parrots are often confident and outgoing birds that love to interact with their caretakers. They do tend to be rather vocal, and some can develop an impressive vocabulary of human words. But because quakers can adapt to living in many climates and become invasive, they are illegal to keep in some parts of the United States. Know your local laws before acquiring one.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green head, wings, and body; gray breast, cheeks, and throat; blue flight feathers; mutations include blue, albino, cinnamon, lutino, and pied</p><h2>Sun Conure</h2><p>There are many conure species commonly kept as pets, with one of the most popular being the beautiful sun conure. These intelligent, playful birds generally love spending time with their caretakers. But don't let their medium size fool you in terms of their noise level. Sun conures are known for being particularly loud, so keep that in mind if you're considering one.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright orange and yellow with highlights of green and blue; black beak and feet; white circles around eyes</p><h2>Senegal Parrot</h2><p>Hand-raised and well-socialized Senegal parrots can be friendly and playful pets, though some tend to bond with only one family member. Having multiple people interact regularly with the bird can help it form other bonds.

But some birds, including parrot species that are often kept as pets, have shown to be smarter than others.</p><h2>African Grey Parrot</h2><p>African Grey parrots are the most heavily studied species of pet birds and have demonstrated a very high level of intelligence. One of the most famous African Greys was named Alex but he passed away in 2007 at the young age of 31 years. He was purchased from a pet store at the age of one year by a doctoral student at the time, Dr. Pepperberg, who cared for him and studied him his entire life.</p><p>Up until Alex, most research on avian intelligence was done using pigeons and needless to say, was disappointing. Alex changed people's thoughts on what a bird was capable of learning. Over the years and up until his death, Alex learned over 100 English words and was thought to have the intelligence level of a five-year-old when he passed away.</p><p>Critics of Alex's studies argue he may have simply been a product of operant conditioning and not true understanding but even if it was simply a trained response, Alex's abilities far surpass anything most pet birds have been able to achieve. Because of Alex, African Grey parrots now have a reputation for being quite smart birds and need constant mental stimulation.</p><h2>Macaws</h2><p>Also considered parrots like the African Grey, there are several different types of macaws, including the longest parrot on the planet, the Hyacinth macaw. All parrots, and therefore macaws, are thought to have similar levels of intelligence.</p><p>The intelligence level of some macaws has been compared to that of a human toddler. They can problem-solve, use tools, and have high levels of communication with other birds, utilizing sounds and even physical changes, such as face blushing.</p><p>A Canadian study published in 2018 showed that after analyzing 98 different bird brains there is a definite difference in the size of one specific part of a parrot's brain. This part of the parrot's brain is similar to that of a primate's, another highly intelligent animal, and is responsible for communicating between the cortex and cerebellum. It is called the spiriform nucleus and in parrots is two to five times larger than it is in a chicken. This part of the brain is thought to play a major role in the planning and execution of advanced behaviors.</p><h2>Cockatoos</h2><p>The cockatoo, also a type of parrot, was the first type of bird to be seen making musical instruments. In Australia, palm cockatoos were observed using twigs and seed pods to make drumsticks, and other types of cockatoos can sway to a musical beat, demonstrating they have an understanding of rhythm.</p><p>One study published in 2014 utilized Goffin cockatoos, a small type of cockatoo, and demonstrated their recognition of object permanence. Object permanence is simply the idea that someone can understand that just because an object isn't visible, it's still there. The example of a nut in a pocket that is out of sight is often used to describe object permanence studies in birds. In human babies, solving an object permanence puzzle isn't typically able to be done until 18 to 24 months of age. To no surprise, the study showed that wild Goffin cockatoos have spatial reasoning abilities that are comparable to primates and human babies.</p><h2>Budgerigars</h2><p>More commonly referred to as budgies or the common parakeet, the budgerigar is one of the smallest members of the parrot family (with the parrotlet being the actual smallest parrot). But just because it's small, doesn't mean that the budgie isn't smart.</p><p>Budgies were the first non-mammal species to demonstrate an understanding of the human language, but they only place them on par with a seven-month-old human child. One study showed that budgies were able to recognize a specific pattern of meaningless words, something that demonstrates the ability to pick out an abstract pattern. This is important because, before this study, only humans, rats, monkeys, and other intelligent species had shown they were able to do this.</p><h2>Conures</h2><p>Like the other types of birds on this list, there are many different kinds of conures and all conures are types of parrots. Because of this, conures also require a lot of mental stimulation and enrichment to keep their smart brains busy. A lot of exercises, toys, and social activities are a must for a conure. Whether it's a Green-cheeked, Jenday, or Sun conure, all conures will be sure to show you just how smart they are.</p>",863

In general, large birds are able to produce louder vocalizations simply because of their size, though there are many chatty small birds, as well. Some of these birds only emit a loud call from time to time while others tend to chirp a lot throughout the day. If you don't mind a rather noisy companion, here are eight of the loudest parrots.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If your bird is excessively vocalizing (screaming), it might be sick, injured, feeling ignored, or otherwise unhappy. Consult a veterinarian if your bird's noise level seems out of the ordinary.</p><h2>Cockatoo</h2><p>Cockatoos are generally affectionate birds capable of producing ear-splitting chirps that not everyone can tolerate. In the wild, these vocalizations are necessary for survival, enabling birds to find their mates and alert flock members to danger. In captivity, cockatoos tend to bond strongly with their caretakers and might loudly vocalize for attention.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 26 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily white plumage; pale yellow on wings and tail; large white crest; black beak (umbrella cockatoo)</p><h2>Macaw</h2><p>In the wild, macaws might travel up to 500 miles a day, using their loud contact calls to keep in touch with flock mates. This translates to considerable noise in captivity, which can get excessive. However, macaws also are quite intelligent and can learn tricks and how to talk, making them fun and playful pets.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 30 to 36 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 46 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green forehead fading into teal on nape, back, tail, and wings; yellow chest and underside of wings; large black beak (blue-and-gold macaw)</p><h2>Eclectus</h2><p>Eclectus parrots are generally easygoing birds that thrive on interacting with their caretakers. They don't tend to make noise constantly, but they do have a distinctive loud honk that can be startling. Some of these birds also have jealous tendencies if they feel like they're being ignored, and they might loudly voice their displeasure.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily emerald green, red and blue under wings, and orange beak (male); primarily bright red, blue on chest and tail, and black beak (female)</p><h2>Amazon Parrot</h2><p>While they are noted for their talking ability, Amazon parrots have another trick: They can produce shrill screams in frequencies that seem to cut right through human ears. That said, there are techniques to help curb their screams. Try rewarding the bird with attention and treats when it's sitting quietly. Also, avoid adding to the noise with your own yelling when the bird is screaming, as this might encourage the behavior.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 23 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body; yellow head; red at the wing bend; tan beak; white rings around the eyes (double yellow-headed Amazon)</p><h2>Conure</h2><p>While they are considerably smaller than many loud parrots, conures can be every bit as loud. These birds can be heard miles away when they scream, which can cause headaches among caretakers and neighbors. Conures also aren't shy about letting you know with their voices when something displeases them. But well-socialized conures often are affectionate birds that thrive with enough mental and physical stimulation.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright orange and yellow with highlights of green and blue; black beak and feet; white circles around eyes (sun conure)</p><h2>African Grey</h2><p>African grey parrots have a reputation as some of the best talking birds. It's what goes on behind the scenes that can cause a problem. Although these birds aren't known as loud screamers, they do have a tendency to chatter throughout the day. And they can be very loud when they want. As highly intelligent birds, they need plenty of games and socialization to keep them entertained. Otherwise, they might vocalize out of boredom.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 9 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly gray plumage with pale edging; black beak and bright red tail (Congo African grey); tan upper beak and maroon tail (Timneh African grey)</p><h2>Lorikeet</h2><p>Lorikeets are generally affectionate birds known for their comical antics. They love to interact with their caretakers and require lots of mental and physical activity to keep them happy and healthy. Because they're naturally social birds that hang out in large groups in the wild, they have loud voices to be heard over their flock. Their high-pitched calls and frequent chirps might be too noisy for many homes.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 6 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue plumage on face and belly; green on wings, back, and head; red breast; yellow and orange highlights on sides; red beak; gray feet (rainbow lorikeet)</p><h2>Ringneck Parakeet</h2><p>Ringneck parakeets are known for being superb talkers, yet some people might not appreciate the noise of them incessantly practicing words. They have the ability to make fairly shrill calls, but many ringnecks stick to quieter chatter for most of the day. They typically are somewhat aloof, though many well-socialized ringnecks bond well with their caretakers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 14 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green plumage; blue tail; yellow under wings; males have black and rose rings around their necks; mutations include blue, cinnamon, albino, and lutino (Indian ringneck)</p>",855

While there are exceptions to every rule, certain bird species tend to do better with an experienced adult to meet their needs. Some of these birds are prone to biting when provoked while others are rather sensitive and don't appreciate rambunctious children. Here are eight bird species that might be best to steer clear of if you have kids.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Most tame pet birds rarely bite out of aggression. But birds use their beaks for grasping, climbing, and exploringoccasionally on their caretakers. This might be unsettling to a child, especially with a large bird species.</p><h2>Macaw</h2><p>Macaws are large, powerful parrots that demand a lot from their caretakers in terms of time and attention. In addition, they are equipped with massive beaks that could severely injure a small child, even if the bird was only trying to play. Macaws also tend to be quite noisy, which might be too chaotic for a home with kids.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 30 to 36 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 46 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green forehead fading into teal on nape, back, tail, and wings; yellow chest and underside of wings; large black beak (blue-and-gold macaw)</p><h2>Cockatoo</h2><p>Although cockatoos are known to be very affectionate birds, they bond strongly to their caretakers and require lots of socialization. A young child most likely has school and other responsibilities that would take them away from their bird. Plus, a cockatoo's beak is capable of producing a very powerful bite that could seriously injure little fingers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 26 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily white plumage; pale yellow on wings and tail; large white crest; black beak (umbrella cockatoo)</p><h2>Amazon Parrot</h2><p>Amazon parrots require lots of space to exercise and play. They also need to spend ample time socializing with their caretakers. Otherwise, they might become depressed or develop destructive behaviors, such as feather picking. While they are great talkers, their care demands often outweigh this novelty in the eyes of many children.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 23 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body; yellow head; red at the wing bend; tan beak; white rings around the eyes (double yellow-headed Amazon)</p><h2>Eclectus Parrot</h2><p>The Eclectus parrot is typically easygoing, but it might be too sensitive to tolerate energetic children. These birds often bond strongly with their caretakers and need to spend ample time with them. They also prefer to adhere to routines, which might not be possible with children's activities. Although they're typically loving birds, they can deliver a damaging bite if provoked.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily emerald green, red and blue under wings, and orange beak (male); primarily bright red, blue on chest and tail, and black beak (female)</p><h2>African Grey</h2><p>African grey parrots often have the intelligence level of a young child, and for this reason, a child probably isn't the best choice for their caretaker. These sensitive birds do well with gentle, patient adults, especially those who have sufficient time to interact with their birds. They need lots of mental and physical stimulation to remain happy and healthy.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 9 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly gray plumage with pale edging; black beak and bright red tail (Congo African grey); tan upper beak and maroon tail (Timneh African grey)</p><h2>Ringneck Parakeet</h2><p>When properly tamed, Indian ringneck parakeets can have charming and comedic personalities. But they do have a reputation for being somewhat nippy and difficult to train, especially during adolescence. Even tame birds usually aren't highly affectionate and might disappoint kids looking for a hands-on pet. They're also highly intelligent and need a caretaker who will challenge them mentally and physically.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 14 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green plumage; blue tail; yellow under wings; males have black and rose rings around their necks</p><h2>Conure</h2><p>Conures typically are intelligent and energetic birds, and they're capable of making some shrill screams that surely will interrupt a young child's nap time. Tame conures can be very affectionate pets, as long as all family members handle them correctly. But these birds can be quite assertive when they want and can quickly turn aggressive if something upsets them.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright orange and yellow with highlights of green and blue; black beak and feet; white circles around eyes</p><h2>Crimson Rosella</h2><p>The crimson rosella is typically not the species for people with limited bird experience, as it's not easy to tame. These birds must be correctly handled on a daily basis for them to remain friendly with their human family members. They also might be nippy, especially during adolescence. And they're quite intelligent and curious by nature, which can get them into trouble if their caretakers don't keep them in a bird-safe area.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Red with patches of blue on face, wings, and tail; black feathers highlighting back; females have green on tail</p>",832

In addition to being noisy, many of these birds also are too large to live comfortably in a home with minimal square footage. Here are eight birds that typically aren't suitable for apartment living.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Remember, some pet bird species are a commitment of 50 years or more. Consider what your living situation might be for the duration of the bird's life before settling on a species.</p><h2>Macaw</h2><p>Macaws are highly intelligent and entertaining parrots, but they have an ear-piercing call that can be heard a mile away when they scream at full capacity. They tend to go through bouts of vocalizations at sunrise and sunsettwo times many people prefer peace and quiet. They're also among the largest pet birds and require roomy enclosures, as well as space for out-of-cage playtime.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 30 to 36 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 46 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green forehead fading into teal on nape, back, tail, and wings; yellow chest and underside of wings; large black beak (blue-and-gold macaw)</p><h2>Amazon Parrot</h2><p>Amazon parrots tend to be friendly and outgoing, but they can be a challenge to keep in small spaces. In addition to their shrill screams and chatter, Amazons need ample room to play. Moreover, they have a tendency to become destructive if they feel bored or neglected, which can lead to property damage for renters.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 23 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body; yellow head; red at the wing bend; tan beak; white rings around the eyes (double yellow-headed Amazon)</p><h2>Cockatoo</h2><p>Cockatoos are typically highly affectionate birds, but they do have ear-shattering screams that can bleed through the most heavily soundproofed walls.

They also prefer to be with their caretakers as often as possible and might vocalize their displeasure when left alone.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 26 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily white plumage; pale yellow on wings and tail; large white crest; black beak (umbrella cockatoo)</p><h2>African Grey Parrot</h2><p>In the wild, African grey parrots live in forested areas where loud calls are necessary for them to communicate. And they won't keep their voices down just because they're in an apartment versus their native landscape. Furthermore, because they're among the most intelligent birds, they require plenty of games and socialization to keep them happy. Otherwise, they might vocalize their boredom or become destructive.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 9 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly gray plumage with pale edging; black beak and bright red tail (Congo African grey); tan upper beak and maroon tail (Timneh African grey)</p><h2>Conure</h2><p>While they are only medium-sized parrots, conures are capable of producing screams that can be heard miles away, causing problems for caretakers and neighbors. These birds also aren't shy about voicing when they're upset or their needs aren't being met. In addition, conures are active, athletic birds that prefer lots of room for out-of-cage play.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright orange and yellow with highlights of green and blue; black beak and feet; white circles around eyes (sun conure)</p><h2>Eclectus</h2><p>Eclectus parrots are typically social birds that require lots of social time from their caretakers.

Plus, these birds' high-pitched calls might bother neighbors in close proximity.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 6 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue plumage on face and belly; green on wings, back, and head; red breast; yellow and orange highlights on sides; red beak; gray feet (rainbow lorikeet)</p><h2>Ringneck Parakeet</h2><p>Ringnecks are often excellent talkers, but their high-pitched chatter might not always be so endearing to nearby neighbors. Also, they require a larger enclosure than you might expect for a medium-sized bird, as it must accommodate their long tail. As active birds, they need space for out-of-cage play along with bird-safe chew toys for them to gnaw on instead of causing damage to your property.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 14 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green plumage; blue tail; yellow under wings; males have black and rose rings around their necks; mutations include blue, cinnamon, albino, and lutino (Indian ringneck)</p>",842

These birds come in all sizes, and some have relatively short lifespans while others can live for 50 years or more. Here are eight red bird species you'll often spot in people's homes.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Birds typically maintain their vibrant plumage for most of the year unless they're molting. If your bird's feathers are looking dull, that's often a sign of a dietary issue.</p><h2>Scarlet Macaw</h2><p>Originating in South America, scarlet macaws can reach lengths of around 35 inches from head to tail. Thus, they need a spacious enclosure and room to play out of the cage. These red parrots are very intelligent and active, requiring ample daily mental and physical exercise. They can be quite affectionate, but they also tend to be rather noisy at times.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 31 to 38 inches</p><p>Weight: 32 to 39 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Vivid red with yellow and blue on wings and tail; white circles around eyes; tan upper bill and black lower bill; black feet</p><h2>Red-and-Green Macaw</h2><p>Although their name suggests otherwise, red-and-green macaws are actually primarily red. These large birds hail from South America and have specialized care requirements not everyone is prepared to handle. Contact a local rescue to meet their birds if possible, so you can get a feel for their personalities and requirements. They can live for 50 years or more, so adopting one is no small decision.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 26 to 40 inches</p><p>Weight: 32 to 60 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Red on head, shoulders, and breast; green on middle of wings turning to blue toward the tips; teal and red tail, red lines around eyes; tan upper bill and black lower bill</p><h2>Female Eclectus</h2><p>The eclectus is a dimorphic species, meaning you can tell the sex of a bird by its feather colors. While the males display bright green plumage, the females exhibit primarily red feathers with a splash of blue on their bellies. Eclectus parrots originated in Australia, and their generally friendly and easygoing personalities have made them popular pets around the world.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily emerald green, red and blue under wings, and orange beak (male); primarily bright red, blue on chest and tail, and black beak (female)</p><h2>Crimson Rosella</h2><p>As far as red parrots go, few are as brilliantly colored as the crimson rosella.

They're also not the best talkers but can learn to whistle well.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Red with patches of blue on face, wings, and tail; black feathers highlighting back; females have green on tail</p><h2>Canary (Red Factor)</h2><p>Most people know canaries as yellow birds, but selective breeding has produced an array of colors, including red. These are generally hands-off pets, as they're quite small and not readily tamed. That means they should live in as large of an enclosure as possible, as that usually is their sole exercise space. Only the male canaries have the notable melodious songs.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 to 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Feathers of bright yellow (most common), red, orange, or white; some varieties have head crests or frilly feathers</p><h2>African Grey</h2><p>The African grey is obviously primarily gray, but it does have flashes of red on its tail feathers.

Fortunately, most tend to be quite sociable and love to play games or learn tricks with their caretakers.They also can be extremely talented talkers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 9 to 14 inches</p><p>Weight: 11 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Mostly gray plumage with pale edging; black beak and bright red tail (Congo African grey); tan upper beak and maroon tail (Timneh African grey)</p><h2>Rose-Breasted Cockatoo</h2><p>The rose-breasted cockatoo leans more on the pink side than a true red, but it's a sight to behold nonetheless. Also known as galah, their native Aboriginal Australian name, these birds typically are friendly and affectionate with their caretakers. But as social birds, they require lots of attention and can become upset or destructive if they feel ignored.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 14 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Pink chest and lower part of face; pinkish-white crest; gray back, wings, and tail; gray feet; tan beak</p><h2>Cherry-Headed Conure</h2><p>Although the cherry-headed conure is primarily green, it's recognized for its bright red mask. These birds are one of the most talkative conure species, making them difficult to keep in apartments or other housing with nearby neighbors. They love being the center of attention and require a devoted caretaker to give them lots of mental and physical exercise.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 6 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body; bright red on face and head; some have red extending down neck; red at tops of wings; white rings around eyes; tan beak; gray feet</p>",842

Moreover, inadequate social interaction can lead to behavioral problems and even illnesses. But for people who care for them properly, large parrots can offer unmatched companionship and a unique pet experience. Here are eight of the best large parrots to keep as pets.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Many large parrot species can live for several decades. Before acquiring one, make sure you can provide care for its entire lifespan.</p><h2>African Grey</h2><p>The intelligence and emotional capacity of African greys are often compared to that of a 5-year-old human. But bear in mind these birds don't move past the maturity of a 5-year-old for their entire lifespan of around 50 years or more.

Many of these birds can learn to talk and perform tricks. They also can be highly affectionate and playful. But it's important to remember large birds require ample space, and they can be rather loud. Also, the expenses associated with their care can be high. If you're ready for the commitment, here are eight of the best large pet bird species.</p><h3>Tip</h3><h2>Eclectus</h2><p>Eclectus parrots are a dimorphic species, meaning the male and female birds sport different feather colors. The male eclectus is a bright green with red and blue accents while the female eclectus is a brilliant red with a blue-purple belly. Living around 30 to 50 years in captivity, these parrots are generally very intelligent and affectionate. They also are rather sensitive and can become depressed if they feel neglected.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily emerald green, red and blue under wings, and orange beak (male); primarily bright red, blue on chest and tail, and black beak (female)</p><h2>Sulphur-Crested Cockatoo</h2><p>The sulphur-crested cockatoo is one of the largest cockatoo species. And with proper care, it can live up to 80 years in captivity. An aviary environment is best for these large birds, offering them room to climb and fly. They're highly affectionate and can be demanding of their favorite human's attention. They need several hours of socialization every day.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 15 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 12 to 31 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily white; crest of yellow feathers; black beak; males have dark brown to black irises while females have reddish-brown</p><h2>Double Yellow-Headed Amazon</h2><p>The double yellow-headed Amazon is one of the most popular Amazon species, living around 60 years in captivity.

They are very intelligent and energetic birds, requiring ample mental and physical exercise. An aviary environment or several hours out of the cage each day is recommended for these large birds to burn off their energy.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 31 to 38 inches</p><p>Weight: 32 to 39 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Vivid red with yellow and blue on wings and tail; white circles around eyes; tan upper bill and black lower bill; black feet</p><h2>Blue-And-Gold Macaw</h2><p>Blue-and-gold macaws can live around 60 years, and they need a dedicated caretaker who can meet their needs for entertainment and socialization. They tend to be friendly birds and enjoy being near their favorite people as much as possible. As large birds, they are capable of incredibly loud vocalizations, so they're not ideal for people who can't handle a noisy environment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 30 to 36 inches</p><p>Weight: 28 to 46 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green forehead fading into teal on nape, back, tail, and wings; yellow chest and underside of wings; large black beak</p><h2>Red-And-Green Macaw</h2><p>The red-and-green macaw, also called the green-winged macaw, is one of the largest pet bird species, living around 50 years in captivity.

And they're some of the most affectionate birds you can find. Many love to cuddle with their favorite humans (or other birds), and they require lots of attention every day to keep them from feeling neglected. They also don't tend to do well in a confined space and need as large of an enclosure as possible.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 18 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 26 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily white plumage; pale yellow on wings and tail; large white crest; black beak</p><h2>Hyacinth Macaw</h2><p>Hyacinth macaws are the largest of all parrots.

43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/low-maintenance-pet-bird-species-390524,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>8 Top Low-Maintenance Pet Bird Species</h1>,"<h1>8 Top Low-Maintenance Pet Bird Species</h1><p>While there's no such thing as a no-maintenance bird, some pet bird species are easier to care for than others. These birds are on the smaller side, which means they typically make less of a mess than large birds do. They also require smaller enclosures, which results in less cleaning for their caretakers. And while some prefer ample socialization with their favorite humans, others are happy entertaining themselves with toys or other bird friends. Here are eight birds that people find to be relatively low-maintenance pets.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Several of these birds can live for 10 years or longer. So even if your bird's day-to-day care is minimal, it's still a substantial commitment.</p><h2>Dove</h2><p>Doves are gentle birds that enjoy interacting with their caretakers but are also content to spend much of the day entertaining themselves. Because they're only medium-sized birds, cleaning up after them is fairly easy. Make sure they're fed a healthy diet, get at least a few hours of out-of-cage exercise, and have access to UV light to avoid a vitamin D deficiency.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 5 to 8 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Plumage of dull grays and browns; black collar around nape of neck; black eyes and beak; mutations include white, orange, and pied (ring-necked dove)</p><h2>Finch</h2><p>As long as finches have a roomy flight cage and a few friendly flock-mates, they generally require no handling or out-of-cage playtime. In fact, most finches would rather socialize with other finches than humans. So anyone who has enough time to feed, water, and clean up after them can enjoy their quiet chirps and amusing antics.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Black and white throat bars, orange cheek patches, and red-orange beak (male zebra finch); gray coloration throughout the body and less vivid beak (female zebra finch)</p><h2>Canary</h2><p>As a member of the finch family, canaries are another excellent choice for bird lovers who prefer a hands-off pet. There are different types of canaries to choose from, and each variety has its own care requirements. In general, these birds need a healthy diet, a cage in which they can fly, and some toys to remain healthy.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 to 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Feathers of bright yellow (most common), red, orange, or white; some varieties have head crests or frilly feathers</p><h2>Budgerigar</h2><p>Like most parrots, budgies bond strongly with their caretakers and appreciate attention. But they tend to be easier to keep occupied than many larger species. A budgie in a spacious cage stocked with plenty of toys can thrive, as long as the bird's caretaker can socialize with it for at least a few hours per day. These birds also don't make much of a mess, especially compared to larger parrots.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 6 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green abdomen; black and yellow back; yellow head; dark blue tail; mutations include blue, yellow, white, and gray</p><h2>Cockatiel</h2><p>Like budgies, cockatiels require at least a few hours of out-of-cage playtime each day. But they are nowhere near as demanding as some larger parrot species. As long as they have a roomy enclosure with toys, they can entertain themselves for several hours. Although they normally don't talk, cockatiels are highly intelligent and can be trained to follow commands and whistle quite well.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Gray body; yellow face and crest; orange cheeks; long tail; mutations include albino, lutino, pied, and cinnamon</p><h2>Lovebird</h2><p>Lovebirds are another species that packs the charm of a large parrot into a smaller, lower-maintenance package. A common misconception is you must keep lovebirds in pairs, but single lovebirds can do fine with at least a few hours a day of interaction with their caretakers. Provide them with a roomy cage with plenty of toys, especially bird-safe items to chew.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short tail; somewhat stocky build; many color varieties, including green, blue, peach, yellow, and white; the face and body usually bear different colors</p><h2>Pionus Parrot</h2><p>Pionus parrots have a reputation for being devoted to their caretakers while retaining a streak of independence. This allows them to be content if you have to leave them alone for several hours. They love playing with their caretakers, but they also are happy amusing themselves with toys. Just make sure these active birds get at least three hours of out-of-cage exercise each day.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 8 to 9 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue head and neck; green body; black patches over ears; red on underside of tail; black beak with red sides</p><h2>Lineolated Parakeet</h2><p>Sometimes mistaken for a budgie, the lineolated parakeet is one of the calmest members of the parrot family. They are quite social and need several hours of interaction with their caretakers each day, especially if they don't have any other bird friends. But as small birds, they don't take up much space or make a huge mess.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily green with black and dark green stripes on back, wings, and sides; blue under wings; dark green tail; tan beak</p>",833

Theythey're incredibly intelligent,and they can be absolutely hilarious.</p><p>There are certain things about birds, however, that only bird owners can truly understand. Some of those things are gush-worthy (like the first time your bird hops onto your shoulder) and others are downright disgusting (all thepoop), but all of those things contribute to the joy that is bird ownership.</p><p>Read on to learn the things only bird owners really know, and why our feathered friends are truly part of the family.</p><h2>You Get Pooped on RegularlyBut You Don't Care </h2><p>Show me someone who is unfazed by getting pooped on by a bird and I'll show you a veteranbird owner. Most people wouldfreak out if a bird pooped on them, but for bird owners, misplaced poop is a regularoccurrence. Poopon the shoulder? Let me just dab it with a napkin. Poop on the shoe? It'll wipe right off (Even though there's a right way to clean bird poop off of clothes).</p><p>Just imagine if being pooped on was aregular occurrence for dogor cat owners.</p><h2>You Bathe With Your Bird </h2><p>meredith_morris / Instagram</p><p>For many people, a daily shower is a private time to prepare for the day ahead or reflect on the day's events. Thiscertainly cannot be said for parrot owners.</p><p>Parrots absolutely love to get soaked with water, so many owners bring 'em right into the bathroom when they shower. Why waste timewater with a separate birdie bath, right? Plus, if you love to belt it out in the shower, having your bird nearby offers the perfect opportunity for a bath time duet.</p><h2>Your Bird Eats Better Food Than You </h2><p>jerrysparrots / Instagram</p><p>You'll eat whatever conventionally grown, mass-produced food is on sale at the grocery store. But when it comes to your bird's fruits and veggies, it's all homegrown, pesticide-free, organic produce. You might even have dedicated (read: off-limits) drawer in your fridge for your bird's eats.</p><h2>You'd Rather Talk to Your Bird Than Most of Your Family Members </h2><p>Hey, no judgment hereit's a known fact that many birds are better conversationalists than distant relatives. Even if your bird only knows a few simple words or phrases, talking to him is way better than talking politics with your great uncle or your love life with that weird second cousin.</p><h2>You Have a ""Quiet Room,"" So Your Bird Can't Interrupt Phone Calls </h2><p>If you've ever taken a conference call from inside your kitchen pantry or bedroom closet, there's a good chance you have a pet bird. Some birds are so apt to squawk, squeal, laugh, or mimic when their owners are on the phone, many people have a ""quiet room"" where they can take phone callsin peace and quiet.</p><h2>Your Bird Has More Toys Than Most Kids </h2><p>kawaiixbluexfluff / Instagram</p><p>It's no secret: Bird toys are not cheap. But most bird owners don't give dropping $15 on a toy their bird will (inevitably) destroy within a week a second thought. Who can resist buying a cool, colorful, new toy for their feathered friends, anyway?!</p><h2>Your Bird's Cage Is Basically a Palace </h2><p>diego_the_conure / Instagram</p><p>Your house is pretty comfortable. There's enough room for your family and friends, and you can host a few overnight guests at a timebut it's nothing over the top. Your bird's cage? It's totally tricked out with the highest quality powder-coated steel wire, entire east and west wings (ha-get it), and maybe even a tiny, bird-sized entertainment room or gym.</p><h2>Your Bird Gets More Attention Than Anyone Else in the House </h2><p>fadetogether / Instagram</p><p>If you have a bird, you know how much she adores getting attention. Oh, you're having some friends over for dinner? She'll put on a song and dance. Chatting on the phone with an annoying customer service representative? Now seems like a great time for her to scream super loud. Trying to get out the door and get to work? You better not forget to shower her with attention for a few minutes first.</p><h2>Your Bird's Chewing Is Worse Than Your Dog's </h2><p>Sure, doggies get all the blame for inappropriate chewing, but the trust is, your bird is just as bad (or worse!) than Fido. From furniture, to clothing, to shoes, to your kids' toys, she'll chew upand maybe even destroy!whatever she can get her tiny, little beak on.</p><h2>Your Bird Is a Better Dancer Than You </h2><p>dis_is_scarlett / Instagram</p><p>It doesn't take much to get a bird to boogeymusic, the television, or even humans speaking can inspire a bird to show off his best moves. You, on the other hand? It takes several, strong drinks, hours of cajoling by your partner, and a whole lot of courage to bust out theat a distant relative's wedding.</p><h2>There's No Better Pet to Come Home to </h2><p>At the end of the day, there's nothing better than greeting your feathered friend and hanging out with her on your shouldereven if that means getting pooped on.</p>",816

When you feel like your bird deserves a special treat, try serving up one of these healthy and easy options that are packed with taste as well as beneficial nutrients.</p><h2>Fruit </h2><p>Mango, pomegranate, bananas,cantaloupe, or apples: It's your choice, and it's also about what your birds prefer. Just about any fruit imaginable is good for your bird's diet. Full of taste and nutritional value, fruits are a wonderful source of vitamins, and these choices are a favorite among the vast majority of pet birds.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>As with any fresh food you offer your bird, remove and discard any leftovers a couple of hours after serving. This prevents bacteria growth inside of your pet's cage. Take it easy on the grapes, however. They contain a lot of sugar.</p><h2>Beans </h2><p>Beans are a wonderful source of vegetable protein, and an outstanding source of fiber for your companion bird which helps keep its digestive system running smoothly.Try boiling a 15-bean soup mix without any seasoning. Allow the beans to cool, and then offer a scoop to your bird. The chances are that this will become a fast favorite with your little friend.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Remember to never serve raw beans to your companion bird as they can be toxicunless cooked.</p><h2>Sprouts </h2><p>Do you like alfalfa sprouts on your salad? Your bird may like them too. Learning tosafely sprout in your kitchen is not difficult at all! Be sure to thoroughly wash any sprouts that you offer your bird. Some may have come into contact with pesticides in their journey from the garden to your local supermarket, and you don't want to pass these toxins on to your pet. Growing your own sprouts is a healthy way to give live, raw nutrition to your flock.</p><h2>Vegetables </h2><p>Wild birds feast on an amazing variety of vegetables in their natural habitats, so it only makes sense that fresh veggies are good for companion birdsas well. Try offering your pet some thoroughly washed and rinsed broccoli, yellow squash, orgreens next time you serve these veggies in your home. Other avian favorites include carrots, kale, root vegetables, and peas.</p><h2>Pasta </h2><p>No matter whether it's cooked or uncooked, birds love pasta. The good thing is, it's full of energy-enhancing carbohydrates! Try boiling some bowtie pasta with vegetables and serving it to your bird when cool. If your pet prefers its pasta crunchy, fill a few raw macaroni noodles with nut butter for a fun and tasty snack.</p><h2>Popcorn </h2><p>Believe it or not, many pet birds enjoy snacking on popcorn. You can serve your bird either popped or unpopped kernels. If you choose to serve the popcorn unpopped, boil the kernels for a bit in plain water to soften the tough hulls. If you desire, you can pop the kernels for your bird using a very small amount of pure coconut.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Be sure never to give your bird microwaved popcorn. These varieties are extremely high in fat and salt, which can be harmful to your pet's health.</p><h2>Cereal or Grains </h2><p>Grain farmers often complain when flocks of wild birds descend on their crops to feast. A hungry group of birds can strip a field of grain in no time. Grains are nutritious and very good for birds. Theyoffer nutritional values that some other foods cannot. Whole grains are an excellent source of vital protein, not to mention beneficial carbohydrates. Try serving your bird oats, quinoa, orGrain Bake, and watch the feeding frenzy begin!</p><h2>Nuts </h2><p>Nuts are extremely healthy for your companion bird. Walnuts, in particular, have many nutritional features not found in other nuts. They're are also very tasty, and many birds appreciate them as special treats or even natural foraging toys. Many birds will spend time exercising their beak and jaw muscles on the shells of some varieties, trying to pry them open. If they find one they simply cannot open, give them a hand and use a nutcracker to assist in cracking them.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Always make sure that any nuts that you serve your bird are clean and unsaltedcertain types of fungi can grow on nuts that aren't clean. Nuts can be frozen to preserve freshness over the long term.</p><h2>Peppers </h2><p>Although many humans have trouble eating spicy peppers, birds can take the heat. It seems that our avian friends lack the taste receptors that pick up on a pepper's stinging bite, which makes them a favorite of birds around the world. Try giving your pet a nice fresh chili, banana, or jalapeno pepper and watch it chomp through it to get to the meat and seeds inside.</p>",814

Contact a bird rescue group, which can help guide you to the species that's right for you.</p><h2>Rose-Breasted Cockatoo</h2><p>The rose-breasted cockatoo is one of the smaller cockatoo species, but don't let its diminutive size fool you. These birds pack a ton of personality into their little bodies. Also known as the galah cockatoo or galah parrot, these cockatoos are very affectionate. But they require a person who can spend lots of time playing and socializing with them, as they bond quite strongly to their caretakers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 15 inches</p><p>Weight: 10 to 14 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Pink chest and lower part of face; pinkish-white crest; gray back, wings, and tail; gray feet; tan beak</p><h2>Eclectus Parrot</h2><p>The eclectus can live for 50 years or more with quality care, making it a substantial commitment.

In fact, these birds can be very rewarding pets when given consistent training.

If you've spotted a green parrot, you can identify the bird by its size, feather pattern, and more. Some green parrots have additional bright colors mixed into their plumage while others have more subtle markings. These birds are intelligent and full of personality, and they require a committed caregiver. If you're considering adopting a bird, here are eight popular green parrots to choose from.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Many parrot species can live for several decades. Make sure you can provide quality care for the bird's entire life before acquiring one.</p><h2>Budgerigar</h2><p>Perhaps the most well-known pet green parrot is the budgie (or parakeet). While not solid green, common budgies are a mixture of yellowish-green interspersed with black spotting and striping patterns. Budgies are very smart and social, yet they're still fairly easy to care for. They can be housed in a relatively small space compared to larger parrots, but they do need lots of mental and physical exercise.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 6 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green abdomen; black and yellow back; yellow head; dark blue tail; mutations include blue, yellow, white, and gray</p><h2>Male Eclectus</h2><p>One of the most striking green parrots is the male eclectus. The eclectus is sexually dimorphic, meaning you can tell the bird's sex by its plumage.

These birds are very social and affectionate but can easily become stressed if they feel neglected.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 17 to 20 inches</p><p>Weight: 13 to 19 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Primarily emerald green, red and blue under wings, and orange beak (male); primarily bright red, blue on chest and tail, and black beak (female)</p><h2>Lovebird</h2><p>Each lovebird species displays different colors, but nearly all of them have a variety that's primarily green. Lovebirds are small birds with big personalities. Their name suggests they are very affectionate, and many well-socialized lovebirds can be. But if these little green parrots aren't handled regularly, they can lose their tameness, which might result in a nippy bird.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short tail; somewhat stocky build; many color varieties, including green, blue, peach, yellow, and white; the face and body usually bear different colors</p><h2>Indian Ringneck Parakeet</h2><p>While selective breeding has given rise to an array of colors, Indian ringneck parakeets are most commonly pastel green. These green parrots are not the best choice for inexperienced bird owners. Ringnecks often go through a ""bluffing"" phase during adolescence, characterized by hormonal aggression. They're also quite smart birds that require lots of mental and physical stimulation to keep them happy.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 14 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 4 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green plumage; blue tail; yellow under wings; males have black and rose rings around their necks</p><h2>Green-Cheeked Conure</h2><p>Green-cheeked conures are small, spunky birds sporting primarily green plumage accented with gray, red, and blue.

These are smart, social creatures that require lots of attention from their caretakers as well as ample space to play.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>Weight: 16 to 23 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green body; yellow head; red at the wing bend; tan beak; white rings around the eyes (double yellow-headed Amazon)</p><h2>Pacific Parrotlet</h2><p>Nicknamed ""pocket parrots"" because of their small size, parrotlets are charming and somewhat feisty birds. They crave attention but require regular handling to keep them tame, as they have a reputation for becoming nippy when left alone too often. As intelligent, active birds, they should spend several hours out of the cage each day for exercise and enrichment.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green head and body; blue on back and behind eyes; mutations include blue, yellow, and white</p><h2>Quaker Parrot</h2><p>Quaker parrots, also known as monk parakeets, are outgoing birds that love to interact with their flockhumans included. Some tend to bond closely with one person, and most are quite gentle when they've been well-socialized. These birds love to entertain, and many become quite adept at talking, mimicking sounds, and singing.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 11 to 12 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 to 5 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green head, wings, and body; gray breast, cheeks, and throat; blue flight feathers; mutations include blue, albino, cinnamon, lutino, and pied</p>",830

They're generally easier to care for than many large bird species, and they're somewhat quieter due to their size. But small birds are still packed with personality. Some prefer to live with other birds while others can be housed alone as long as they get plenty of human socialization. Here are eight of the most popular small birds to keep as pets.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Even for a small bird, the general rule is to provide as large a cage as possible, especially if the bird will be spending lots of time in it.</p><h2>Finch</h2><p>Finches are ideal for people who want to enjoy watching birds but prefer not to handle them. They are somewhat skittish, appreciating the companionship of other finches over humans. Pet finches typically do well in flocks of three to five and require a spacious cage in which they can fly, as that usually is their sole space for exercise. There are many types of finches, including the zebra finch, Gouldian finch, and society finch.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Black and white throat bars, orange cheek patches, and red-orange beak (male zebra finch); gray coloration throughout the body and less vivid beak (female zebra finch)</p><h2>Canary</h2><p>Native to the Macronesian islands, canaries are known for their bright plumage and beautiful songs. Like other members of the finch family, these small birds don't tolerate handling well. But with ample training, a canary might learn to perch on a person. House a canary in a roomy flight cage, especially if you don't have another safe space for it to fly. Additionally, it's often necessary to house canaries individually, as they can be territorial.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 to 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Feathers of bright yellow (most common), red, orange, or white; some varieties have head crests or frilly feathers</p><h2>Budgerigar</h2><p>Budgerigars, also known as budgies or parakeets, are small birds with big personalities. As one of the smallest parrots, budgies come in an array of colors, and they can learn to talk. These smart birds require lots of toys and socialization to keep them happy. If you can't spend enough time with your budgie, consider getting at least two to prevent loneliness.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 6 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green abdomen; black and yellow back; yellow head; dark blue tail; mutations include blue, yellow, white, and gray</p><h2>Parrotlet</h2><p>Parrotlets, also called ""pocket parrots,"" don't seem to realize how small they are. Like their cousin, the huge-by-comparison Amazon parrot, parrotlets tend to have bold, comical personalities and crave attention. They need sufficient handling, as they have a reputation for becoming nippy when not properly trained. They're also active birds and should spend several hours outside the cage each day.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 to 5 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green head and body; blue on back and behind eyes; mutations include blue, yellow, and white</p><h2>Bourke's Parakeet</h2><p></p><p>Bourke's parakeets are generally mellow birds. These Australia natives often bond closely with their humans and do well with other peaceful birds, such as finches. But their gentle nature can make them a target of more aggressive birds.They're only moderately active but still require at least a few hours of exercise outside the cage each day.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 7 to 9 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Brown-tinted plumage; pink abdomen; blue rump; yellowish-brown beak; males have blue crowns while females have white</p><h2>Lovebird</h2><p>True to their name, lovebirds thrive in bonded pairs. But a single bird also can do well with an involved caretaker. Lovebirds don't like to be alone and can develop behavioral issues, such as biting, with neglect. They're also fairly vocal, making loud, high-pitched chirps you might not expect from such a small bird. The most common species kept aspets are the Fischer's, black-masked, andpeach-facedlovebirds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 7 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Short tail; somewhat stocky build; many color varieties, including green, blue, peach, yellow, and white; the face and body usually bear different colors</p><h2>Green-Cheeked Conure</h2><p>Green-cheeked conures have become popular for their playful, affectionate disposition, but they do require adequate handling to avoid behavioral issues. These South America natives tend to be fast learners with tricks and games (though most usually don't talk). However, they are prone to feather picking if they're bored or neglected.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 10 to 11 inches</p><p>Weight: 2 to 3 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Predominantly green; olive cheek patches; gray breast and head; maroon tail; blue flight feathers; mutations include turquoise, yellow, and cinnamon</p><h2>Cockatiel</h2><p>Native to Australia, cockatiels are valued for their friendly personalities. When properly socialized, they tend to be docile birds that love people. They're generally not noisy, though they can learn to be excellent whistlers.A single cockatiel is fine, as long as you give it lots of attention. Otherwise, a pair of birds can keep each other company.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 12 to 13 inches</p><p>Weight: 3 ounces</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Gray body; yellow face and crest; orange cheeks; long tail; mutations include albino, lutino, pied, and cinnamon</p>",821

Several macaws are endangered, with the hyacinth, red-fronted and blue-throated macaws among the most seriously endangered.</p><p>Although these charming, personable birds are understandably popular as pets, demand has threatened their numbers in the wild. Many macaws are illegally trapped in their native rainforest homes and sold.</p><p>Most macaws are large and need a lot of social interaction. In other words, they're high-maintenance pets. But if you're okay with a pet that requires a significant time investment from its owner, a macaw may be a good option. Here are a few of the different types of macaw, and what makes each one a little different.</p><h3>7 Things to Know About Owning a Macaw</h3><h2>Blue and Gold Macaws</h2><p>Intelligent and sociable, the blue and gold macaw grows to be quite large, measuring nearly three feet from the beak to the tip of the tail. This is not a pet for a novice bird owner; it rivals a cat or a dog in its social needs. They're also very loud birds, and their vocalization includes flock calls that sound like screaming. They're also known to ""chew"" with their beaks when held in captivity.</p><p>The reward for a macaw owner willing to invest the energy is a pet whose lively personality makes it an excellent companion. Blue and gold macaws, also known as blue and yellow macaws, bond closely with their human owners.</p><h2>Greenwing Macaws</h2><p>The greenwing macaw has a very sweet disposition, and respond well to training. They'll need attention and time to bond with their owners but will thrive in a supportive environment. If you're considering this bird as a pet (or any macaw, for that matter), don't expect to leave it for long stretches of time. This bird needs a lot of social interaction.</p><h2>Hahn's Macaws</h2><p>These little guys are the smallest of the macaws and are very easygoing. Social and intelligent, Hahn's macaws respond quickly to training and form close bonds with their owners.</p><p>Hahn's macaws can become good talkers with practice. While they do exhibit many typical macaw behaviors such as screaming, they are a good choice for the bird lover that wants a macawbut isn't quite ready to take on a large bird.</p><h2>Hyacinth Macaws</h2><p>Hyacinth macaws are the largest type of macaw and arguably the hardest to care for. Because these birds demand more time and attention than other species, Hyacinth macaws are definitely not the right pets for new bird owners. Large, beautiful, and intelligent, they can be quite alluringbut are suitable only for pet owners with the right amounts of patience and devotion.</p><h2>Hybrid Macaws</h2><p>Hybrid macaws are unlike any other macaw species, bred strictly for color and pet quality. Because these birds are of mixed heritage, they possess the combined personality traits of the species that were crossed to produce them. Only an experienced owner with a thorough understanding of macaw behavior should consider a hybrid.</p><h2>Illiger's Macaws</h2><p>Illiger's macaws are playful, friendly birds that enjoy human interaction. When hand fed as babies and raised in loving attentive homes, these intelligent parrots will bond strongly with their owners and will quickly respond to positive training techniques.</p><p>Illiger's macawsrequire a lot of mental stimulation, and they like to stay busy.</p><h2>Military Macaws</h2><p>Social and very vocal, Military macaws have a reputation for being pleasant, even-tempered pets when properly socialized. Military macaws are curious birds, and they enjoy playing and interacting with their human ""flock.""</p><p>But like other macaws, these birds will require a lot of energy from their human owners. Plan to spend a lot of time with a military macaw if you get one as a pet.</p><h2>Scarlet Macaws</h2><p>These birds are intelligent, but they need daily socialization and stimulation so that they stay tame. Scarlet macaws get bored quite easily, so they should be provided with plenty of toys to play with, in addition to near-constant attention from their owners.</p><p>Hand-fed scarlet macaws can be very affectionate, but potential owners should keep in mind that like all macaws, they can be noisy. Don't plan on keeping one as a pet if you live in an apartment or small living space, it probably won't work.</p><h2>Severe Macaws</h2><p>Bernard Spragg.</p><p>Friendly and comical, the severe macaw's large personality makes it a favorite with bird lovers. With adequate socialization, severe macaws bond quickly with their owners, responding well to training and boasting impressive speech abilities. They're as needy as other macaw varieties, but severe macaws can be charming companions.</p><h2>Yellow-Collared Macaws</h2><p>Affectionate but somewhat mischievous, the yellow-collared macaw has a reputation for being an intelligent and resourceful little parrot. They thrive on attention from their owners, and like other macaws will seek that attention by any means necessary.</p><p>Yellow-collared macaws are clever and tend to be escape artists, so it's important to provide a cage that is safe and secure. Although some are one-person birds, most yellow-collared macaws make good family pets.</p>",813

Wild birds call out to their flocks to let others know of their whereabouts or alert them to predators. Still, bird speciesand individual birds within specieshave varying noise levels. Although no pet bird will be completely silent, several aren't prone to making much noise. Some of these birds aren't inclined to screech and scream while others simply have soft voices that make for subtle background chatter. Here are eight of the quietest pet birds.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>A quiet bird might be a sick bird. If your bird isn't vocalizing normally, consult a veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h2>Finch</h2><p>Finches are tiny birds with tiny voices, making them a great option for people who want a quiet bird. They tend to make pleasant chirps and peeps throughout the day, and even a small flock has a relatively low noise level. While they are generally hands-off birds for humans, finches prefer to share their space with flock mates. They require an enclosure in which they can fly, as that typically is their only space for exercise.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 4 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Black and white throat bars, orange cheek patches, and red-orange beak (male zebra finch); gray coloration throughout the body and less vivid beak (female zebra finch)</p><h2>Canary</h2><p>Like other members of the finch family, canaries also don't tolerate handling well and need a roomy flight cage. Moreover, these birds are relatively solitary and might fight when housed in the same cage. Although male canaries are known for their melodious songs, their small size keeps the volume to a minimum.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 5 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 0.5 to 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Feathers of bright yellow (most common), red, orange, or white; some varieties have head crests or frilly feathers</p><h2>Budgerigar</h2><p>Budgies (or parakeets) have a remarkable ability to learn to talk, just like their larger parrot cousins. While they like to chatter throughout the day, budgies cannot physically scream at the volume of a large bird. These intelligent, playful birds can be very social with their caretakers. They require a variety of toys to keep them entertained, as well as at least a few hours of daily out-of-cage exercise.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 6 to 8 inches</p><p>Weight: 1 ounce</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Green abdomen; black and yellow back; yellow head; dark blue tail; mutations include blue, yellow, white, and gray</p><h2>Parrotlet</h2><p>Like budgies, tiny parrotlets lack the ability to screech like an Amazon parrot or a cockatoo. Their soft chatter and chirps are hardly enough to disturb even the most sensitive ears. Although they are small, these birds are full of energy and spunk.

Some species have the capacity to learn a plethora of words and phrases while others only tend to repeat a few simple words.Here are eight small and medium pet bird species that can be trained to talk.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Regardless of species, no bird will learn to talk unless it spends ample time interacting with its caretaker and practicing words. And even with practice, some birds might never master mimicking the human voice.</p><h2>Budgerigar</h2><p>One of the smallest and most popular pet birds is also among the best talkers.

56,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lost-pet-bird-4773150,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>What to Do If You Lost a Pet Bird</h1>,"<h1>What to Do If You Lost a Pet Bird</h1><p>If you have a lost bird, don't panicwhat you do in the next few hours and days can go a long way in bringing your bird back again. Your pet bird might have escaped its cage, flown off its perch, or slipped out the door before you could react. Regardless of the circumstances, your lost bird just might be found if you have a solid game plan and make the most of your search.</p><h2>Make a Local Search Your First Step </h2><p>The obvious challenge in losing your bird is the fact that he can flyand you can't. For this reason, birds are capable of covering great distances. However, if your pet bird has been housed inside of an enclosure most of his life or has frequently had his wing feathers clipped, he is likely an inexperienced flier.</p><p>As a result, he may have flown away but there's a good chance that he hasn't gone far. Make a quick search of your yard as first step, then circle the neighborhood. Carefully look into tree canopies and on roof tops to see if you can spot your lost bird.</p><p>It's equally important to listen for your lost bird. The unique calls and vocalizations of your bird will likely stand out against the general calls of wild birds common to your area. Many bird owners often hear their bird in the vicinity before actually spotting it.</p><p>Often, lost birds take their freedom flight only a short distance before landing in a tree or other elevated structure. As inexperienced fliers, many pet birds struggle to land or descend and will sometimes stay in the same tree for an extended period of time.</p><h2>Lure Your Bird Back </h2><p>One technique that may bring your bird home is to place his or her cage outside with the door open. Inside, put your bird's favorite snack or treat to provide extra incentive for him to return.</p><p>Similarly, some bird owners with multiple birds will position another bird's cage near an open windowor even outside (though not unsupervised). The vocalization from a familiar bird may lure your bird back home.</p><h2>Spread the Word </h2><p>The more help you can enlist in the search for your lost bird, the greater the chances that you'll be able to locate him. One simple but effective tool is to create a flyer. Post it in your neighborhood, at local pet stores or bird shops, with local veterinarians, and pass it out to people you meet as you search the neighborhood. Dog walkers, the mail deliverer, and others you see regularly can be big allies in your search.</p><p>In addition to a paper flyer, consider placing an announcement in local or city newspapers. It's also can be beneficial to post online that you've lost your bird. Any bird groups you belong to on social media or your personal page make good options. Post to your local community boards or bird rescues; Bird Hotline is one site that lists lost and found bird postings. Include similar information to the flyer, along with a picture.</p><p>You should also file a police report regarding your lost bird. Provide as much information regarding your bird and the date, time, and location that he or she was lost. You should also contact your local humane society and animal control to advise them of your lost bird. Often, people that find a pet bird will contact these resources when looking for the animal's owner.</p><h2>What to Do If You Don't Find Your Lost Bird Right Away </h2><p>The most important thing to know is don't give up immediately. Many birds are lost for several days before being found and others have been gone for a week or more. At first, the bird may enjoy its new liberty but soon they'll begin to tire and become hungryespecially since pet birds are typically inexperienced foragers.</p><p>Continue your search and circle back with businesses and organizations you left your flyer with. Check in with your local pet shops and veterinarians, and continue to monitor the humane society in the event that someone turns your bird in.</p><p>Sometimes, a lost bird isn't immediately found. You may begin to give up hope of finding your lost bird. Weeks and months may pass, though you should know that there is still a chance your bird might be found in the local areaor even many miles from home.</p><p>How do you know when to give up the search for your lost bird? This is a personal decision and no one can tell you to stop your search and extinguish your hopes. While the chances of finding your feathered friend are best within the first few days, there are birds that have been found many months after becoming lost. With persistence, diligence, and hope, you may safely bring your lost bird home again.</p>",798

Any of these names are acceptable, although Maximilian's Pionus seems to be the most widely used.</p><h2>Scientific Name </h2><h2>Origin </h2><p>Maximilian's Pionus originate in the forests and wooded areas of South America, specifically in arange from Brazil to Argentina. Because of their popularity in the pet trade in recent years, however, the Maximilian's Pionus is kept in captivity in homes all over the world.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>The typical Maximilian's Pionus can reach lengths of up to 12 inches from head to tail at maturity, although it is more common for these birds to be in the range of 10 to 11 inches tall. A healthy weight for an adult bird of this species would be in the range of 8 to 9 ounces.</p><h2>Average Lifespan </h2><p>Like all parrots, the Maximilian's Pionus can be expected to live for quite a long time. In fact, these birds typically live for up to 40 years as pets in captivity, and some can live for even longer. This is why it is so important for those who are thinking about adopting one of these birds to do plenty of research on the species before bringing one home. Caring for any animal for 40 years or more is a long-term commitment that should not be taken lightly.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Those who own Maximilian's Pionus describe their personalities as fun-loving, comical, affectionate, and a little bit mischievous. Certainly, these traits can be true of all hookbills, but the charm of the Maximilian's Pionus seems to set them apart from even other Pionus species. They are known to be the best talkers among the Pionus, building impressive vocabularies and taking well to trick training. This could be because the Maximilian's Pionus enjoys spending quite a bit of time with their owners. Anyone interested in adopting one of these birds should make sure that they have plenty of time to spend playing, socializing, and interacting with their feathered friend.</p><h2>Colors </h2><p>In terms of colorful plumage, the Maximilian's Pionus often gets overlooked in favor of more brightly feathered parrots. At first glance, these birds might appear dingy or even drab, but a closer look reveals real beauty in their coloration. The predominant color on these birds is a brownish olive greenbut is highlighted by a golden bronze type of sheen on their undersides. Their heads are covered in darker colored feathers edged in lighter gray, a feature which gave rise to their being called ""scaly headed parrots"" by some. The brightest parts of these parrots, by far, are their tails. The tailfeathers of a Maximilian's Pionus are a rainbow of green, blue, and red, adding the perfect finishing touch to these neat looking birds.</p><h2>Feeding </h2><p>Like other types of parrots, most Maximilian's Pionus do well in captivity when fed a high-quality seed and pellet mix, supplemented daily with fresh fruits and vegetables. Like some other types of birds, Maximilian's Pionus are known to be prone to obesity, so it is recommended to closely watch their intake of high-fat options such as sunflower seeds and nuts. They also need a higher intake of certain vitamins than other birds, particularly Vitamin A. To supply this, many who own Maximilian's Pionus make sure that their diet includes plenty of fresh, leafy greens such as spinach, romaine lettuce, and kale.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Maximilian's Pionus need plenty of exercise in order to maintain the best physical condition possible. For more healthy birds, it's recommended that they are allowed at least 3 to 4 hours outside of their cage each day in a supervised, bird-proof setting. This gives them the opportunity to play, stretch, and make sure that all their muscle groups get a nice workout.</p><h2>Maximilian's Pionus as Pets </h2><p>Known as one of the more quiet bird species, Maximilian's Pionus might be a good choice for those who want a larger parrot but don't want to have to deal with the extra screaming and noise that comes along with a bird like a Macaw or Cockatoo. While they bore easily due to their high intelligence, Maximilian's Pionus who are kept properly occupied are known to make sweet and loving pets who thrive on the bond that they form with their owners. If you're interested in learning more about keeping a Maximilian's Pionus, contact a local breeder or a bird club or aviculture society in your area. These types of resources will offer you plenty of information on what it's really like to live with these types of birds and will assist you in your decision to adopt one if you decide that a Maximilian's Pionus would be a good fit for your family.</p>",782

And while it can be quite common and enjoyable to have a petparrot or another domestic bird, the same is not true for this wild bird of prey. Other than zoos and wild bird sanctuaries, it is downright illegal to own a snowy owl in North America.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Snowy owl</p><p>Adult Size: about 36 inches tall with a 48 to 60-inch wingspan</p><p>Lifespan: about 9 years in the wild; up to 28 years in captivity</p><h2>Can You Own a Pet Snowy Owl? </h2><h3>Warning</h3><p>It is not legal to own a snowy owl in the U.S. Private ownership is prohibited by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service per the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918.</p><h3>Legality </h3><p>It is not legal to own a snowy owl in the U.S. Private ownership is prohibited by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service per the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, but if you would like to know more about these fascinating birds, read on.</p><h2>Snowy Owl Behavior and Temperament </h2><p>Snowy owls are typically solitary and aren't known to be affectionate toward each other or humans. Since they're most active at night and rely on sizable live prey as their main diet, they don't make a good pet.</p><p>This bird uses its large talons and sharp beak to catch prey. And it employs its unique owl featuresnight vision, keen hearing, and aerodynamic bodyto become a silent but deadly predator. Since it is also prey to other larger animals, when threatened, both male and female owls defend themselves and their nests by dive-bombing and attacking perceived threats.</p><h2>Housing </h2><p>Captive owls are housed in zoos or raptor rehabilitation centers. At these locations, an owl enclosure needs to be a minimum of 20 square feet with one or more perches that mimic tree branches.</p><p>Owl enclosures require regular cleaning to maintain sanitary living conditions. Owls defecate profusely and expel owl pelletsregurgitated clumps of indigestible bits from prey items, such as fur, bones, and teeth. Owls, like most birds, go through an annual molt, and during this time, they lose large quantities of feathers that must be removed from the enclosure.</p><p>Any excrement, discarded feathers, or rotting refuse left in the enclosure creates a breeding ground for bacteria, which can affect the health of an owl.</p><h2>What Do Snowy Owls Eat and Drink? </h2><p>The snowy owl eats small mammals and birds as well as insects in the wild. Its preferred food in its native arctic habitat is lemmings. On average, an owl will consume three to five lemmings per day.</p><p>In captivity, owls are fed whole mice, rats, and chicks that are either live or thawed from frozen. It needs at least seven to 12 small animals per day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Snowy owls are prone to aspergillosis, a fungal infection that causes respiratory problems, depression, and loss of appetite. Birds of prey originating in arctic or subarctic climates tend to be more susceptible. The fungus often causes problems for these owls in a warmer, drier environment than their native range.</p><h2>Purchasing </h2><p>Since the birds are not legal to purchase in the U.S., you can sponsor or ""adopt"" an owl that lives its life in a pet sanctuary or an animal center. Many shelters or conservation organizations help heal injured wild birds or care for wild owls that were initiallypets.</p><p>Adoption programs ensure that these birds are cared for by professionals, given the appropriate enclosure, attention, training, and care. Your monetary contribution can provide for that owl's needs, and in the case of local bird sanctuaries, may grant you the ability to visit the bird. Depending on the sanctuary, they may even allow more interactive engagement, such as helping with feeding or taking part in owl care. Sponsoring an owl helps that wild animal and provides much-needed support to the center or organization that provides for its care.</p><h2>Similar Pets to the Snowy Owl </h2><p>Owning snowy owls is illegal, but these birds would not make good pets anyway. They are aloof with humans and fiercely focused on locating and catching prey almost all of their time. Their sharp beaks and claws make them dangerous to handle by even the most experienced keepers.</p><p>Captive owls rarely bond well with humans. They are solitary creatures in the wild and are not affectionate animals.</p><p>Snowy owls are considered ""vulnerable"" species due to their declining population in the wild; they are not classified as endangered.</p>",760
60,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-does-bird-bite-me-so-much-390293,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,"<h1>Why Is My Pet Bird Biting and ""Beaking"" Me?</h1>","<h1>Why Is My Pet Bird Biting and ""Beaking"" Me?</h1><p>When a pet bird uses its mouth on your hand, you may just be being ""beaked"" rather than bitten. Birds use their beaks much like they use feet, to grasp items and maintain balance; ""beaking"" is the correct term for this behavior. It's important to discriminate between beaking and biting so that you can provide the appropriate response when your pet bird gives you a true bite.</p><h2>Why Birds ""Beak"" You </h2><p>There are several reasons that a bird might beak you as opposed to giving you a true bite. First, pet birds routinely use their beaks as a third hand to test the strength of perches. They also use their beaks to generally check out the physical rigidity of all climbing structures, including its owner's hand before they step up. New bird owners often confuse this exploratory beak usage with being bitten.</p><p>Also, a bird's tongue contains myriad nerve endings, and it is used to sense taste and texture. If you are wearing new clothing or are holding new apparatus in hand, that beak may be aiding the tongue in evaluating those items that are new to the bird's world.</p><p>No matter the reason, while being beaked may not be the most pleasant experience, it feels quite different from an actual bite. Beaking feels more like the bird is using you as a stabilizing anchor point as it shifts posture and collects new information about its surroundings.</p><h2>A True Bite </h2><p>Birds will truly bite now and then, but only if they are frightened, startled, or if they feel cornered and vulnerable. Chances are that your bird is not trying to be aggressive, asbitingis not a dominance behavior in birds. Biting among wild birds is usually only an act of self-defense, and not a ""pecking order"" signal, nor any type of punishment or social correction.</p><p>The true bite is often lightning-quick and hard. The bite is often accompanied by ""ruffled feathers"" body language which is meant to teach you to back away because the bird needs more space. However, many times this act of self-defense will break a handler's skin or at least result in a painful dent. This small injury is often the best way to tell the difference between being bitten and being beaked.</p><h2>Responses to Beaking </h2><p>One way you may inadvertently teach your bird to beak you   isif you happen to let out a high pitched yell when you are beaked. This is especially true with younger birds that are still learning social norms.</p><p>Birds, especially the parrots, are likely to interpret your sound as a positive comment and reinforcer; the bird will think you are praising it rather than protesting. In this way, socializing a bird is much like socializing a puppy. Use high vocal tones for approval and use low tones to discourage what is unwanted.</p><p>Once you have discerned which kind of beak use is occurring most often, it will be easier to alter both situations. Understands that beaking is just part of owning any bird. But if your bird's beaking is causing problems, the best option is to use a wrist perch, a leather arm cover, or a vest as an added layer of protection for your clothing and skin.</p><p>If you are in fact being bitten, a different response is required. There are steps you can take to help put your bird at ease and curb this undesirable behavior.</p><h2>Correct Any True Biting </h2><p>Tocorrect bad behavior in birds, try not to get excited or call out vocally. Instead, use a frown and body language that shows you are unhappy. Speak calmly and softly in low tones to tell your bird that this is not acceptable behavior. As you do so, immediately place the bird back in its cage or on its perch.</p><p>As you ponder what could have made your bird feel cornered enough to bite, give the bird a few minutes of ""time out,"" with no eye contact from you by removing yourself from the room. The most important element of any time out is to resume interacting with your bird positively (within 10 minutes), which allows them to show you that they have learned to temper themselves a bit more.</p><p>Instruct any guests to expect normal beaking at times and not to react to it excitedly or vocally. This will help prevent your bird from feeling threatened by a stranger enough to bite.</p><p>Of special note: Young children may not be mature enough to respond to a bird correctly. Soft skin can be cut and injured by a bite or even by normal beaking, so proceed with caution when your bird is around young guests.</p>",783
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cold-weather-bird-care-390724,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>How to Care for Pet Birds in Cold Weather</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for Pet Birds in Cold Weather</h1><p>When the weather outside gets frightful, it can spell trouble for pet birds. Because most pet bird species hail from geographic areas that have warm, tropical climates, a drop in temperature can be devastating to both their comfort and health, even if you keep your bird inside. Learn why cold weather can pose such a problem for pet birds, as well as tips to keep your feathered friend safe, healthy, and comfortable.</p><h2>Mimic Your Bird's Native Environment </h2><p>Although your pet bird was likely bred in captivity, its species is probably native to a region that stays fairly warm year-round. For instance, macaws come from the rainforests of South America, ringneck parakeets come from temperate climates in India, and African grey parrots originate in the warmest regions of Africa. These types of birds are simply not designed to cope with harsh winter temperatures.</p><p>Thus, it is extremely important that the climate in which you house pet birds mimics their natural habitat. It often can be dangerous to expose a pet bird to an environment that is any cooler than 65 degrees Fahrenheit. That means outdoor aviaries must be monitored extremely closely for sudden changes in weather. And even if you keep your bird in a climate-controlled environment, a drafty window or a quick burst of cold air from an open door can stress its immune system and make it susceptible to illness.</p><p>Cold birds often sit with their feathers fluffed up to retain body heat, and they don't move around much. This behavior also can be a sign of illness. So if increasing the temperature of your bird's environment doesn't return it back to its normal behavior fairly quickly, contact your avian veterinarian.</p><h2>Make Sure Your Heating Is Safe for Birds </h2><p>Unless your home has central heat and air, along with good insulation, providing a comfortable temperature for your pet bird can be easier said than done. Building a fire in a fireplace is not a good option. Not only does an open fire pose a burn risk for a bird out of its cage, but the smoke from burning wood is also a health hazard. Birds have extremely sensitive respiratory systems and can easily develop serious health issues, including sudden death, from any smoke or fumes.</p><p>For the same reason, many space heaters are also a poor choice to keep your pet bird warm. Some are treated with a nonstick coating, which gives off toxic fumes that are known to be lethal to pet birds. In addition, some space heaters run on gas or kerosene, which also produce fumes that could kill your feathered friend.</p><p>Some ways to safely keep your bird warm when your house gets chilly is to move the bird's cage away from doors and windows. The interior parts of a home are typically the warmest and farthest from chilly drafts. Moreover, cover your bird's cage at night when it's time to go to bed and the temperature drops. This also will deflect drafts and help to maintain a comfortable temperature inside the cage.</p><p>Plus, if you find any air leaks, seal them as soon as possible. A shrink-wrap insulation kit is often an easy way to weather-proof windows. But be wary of using spray foam and certain other types of insulation around your bird, as they can give off toxic chemicals. Consult your vet for avian-safe products.</p><h2>Don't Forget About Humidity </h2><p>Keeping your bird warm is only half of the equation when it comes to helping your pet make it through the colder months safe and sound. Many home heating systems can make the indoor air very dry, robbing a bird of much-needed humidity in its environment. Low humidity levels can lead to dry skin, brittle feathers, preening issues, respiratory problems, and more in a bird.</p><p>Fortunately, the humidity problem is fairly easy to solve. One option is to purchase an electronic humidifier and place it the room where your bird's cage is located. Or you can gently mist your bird with water from a spray bottle on a regular basis. Most birds enjoy a daily misting, as it mimics the natural rainfall they would get in the wild. It also helps to promote healthy preening behavior and soothe dry skin. However, first make sure your environment is warm enough for your bird before misting. Otherwise, the water on its feathers can cause the bird to become chilled.</p><p>By being proactive about your bird's heat and humidity during the colder months, you'll greatly reduce the chance of health complications in your pet (and subsequent vet bills) due to the climate. And you'll maximize the number of happy, cozy winters you get to spend with your pet.</p>",778

Their scientific name is .</p><h2>Origin </h2><p>The wild Blue Headed Pionus makes its home in the tropical areas of Costa Rica, Central America, and South America, where it thrives in humid areas and nests in forest trees. It has been kept in captivity for many years, and this has led the Blue Headed Pionus to be beloved as a pet in homes all over the world.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>The Blue Headed Pionus is a medium to large sized parrot. At maturity, these types of birds typically reach lengths of up to 12 inches when measured from beak to tail. They are relatively stocky parrots, like other types of Pionus, and adults generally weigh in the neighborhood of 8 to 9 ounces when at a healthy weight.</p><h2>Average Lifespan </h2><p>Like other Pionus species and most hookbills, a healthy, well taken care of Blue Headed Pionus can be expected to live up to 40 years in captivity  and some have even been documented to live even longer. Due to their exceptionally long lifespan and the attention that is required when caring for a pet bird, potential owners are strongly cautioned to do plenty of research and make sure that they are ready to commit to caring for one of these birds before adopting one.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>The Blue Headed Pionus, like other Pionus parrots, has a reputation for being independent while at the same time remaining closely bonded and devoted to their owners. They enjoy interacting with their human family members, playing games, and amusing themselves with plenty of bird toys. Many owners have reported that they have easygoing, gentle personalitiesand that they tend to not bite as much as other species  although they are certainly capable of doing so if they take an inclination. Pionus parrots are also widely reported to be among thequieter types of parrot species, especially for their size.</p><h2>Colors </h2><p>The beautiful plumage of the Blue Headed Pionus is responsible for the bird's name as well as its immense popularity among pet owners. The body of these birds is mainly a bright green color, with bronze overtones on the upper parts of the wings. The head is a bright and brilliant blue color, and this continues to the mid part of the bird's breast. They have darker, dusty colored circles on each of their cheeks, and red feathers on the undersides of their tails, as all Pionus parrots do. Another distinctive feature of these birds is a characteristic red patch on the upper mandible of the beak.</p><h2>Feeding </h2><p>Like all parrots, ample attention should be paid to the nutritional content of the Blue Headed Pionus' diet. In captivity, these birds tend to do best when they are fed a high quality commercial pelleted diet, supplemented with a seed mix formulated for large birds. These foods should always be served in conjunction with a variety of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables to ensure that they are getting the proper amounts of vitamins. These parrots also normally enjoy a variety of homemade bird treats such as bird bread recipes, sprouts, and other nutritious creations.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Pionus parrots are very active, and they need lots of room to play and exercise each day. That said, anyone who is interested in owning one of these birds should make sure that they have time in their schedules to give their pets 3 to 4 hours outside of the cage per day, at a minimum. This out of cage playtime should be strictly supervised and should occur in a bird-proof area as Pionus are very curious and could get into an accident if left to their own devices.</p><h2>Blue Headed Pionus as Pets </h2><p>Beautiful and loving, the Blue Headed Pionus has enjoyed great popularity as a pet for many years, and it seems that this trend is not in danger of diminishing. While they are charming, easygoing birds, it cannot be stressed enough that they are not the best pets for everybody.</p><p>If you are thinking about adopting a Blue Headed Pionus, you should definitely do plenty of research to make sure that your lifestyle is suited to caring for one of these birds. Contact a local breeder or an aviculture society in your area and speak with people who have experience keeping and raising Blue Headed Pionus parrots. They will be able to guide you to the proper resources that will help you to decide if a Blue Headed Pionus is the right bird for you.</p>",762

Even those who don't profess to be bird lovers can rarely resist the charms of a well-behaved parrot. Indeed they embody so many things that people find desirable in their pets.</p><p>All to often, however, those who would love to invite a parrot into their lives refrain from adopting one because they aren't aware of the many available varieties. Not all parrots are extremely large. Read on to discover some smaller, more manageable species that can make excellent pets for the right people.</p><h2>Budgies </h2><p>Long hailed as one of the most popular of all the pet bird species, the tiny Budgie (also known in many places as simply ""Parakeet"") is one of the smallest species of true parrots, and can make an exceptional choice for parrot enthusiasts who feel that they aren't quite ready for a very large bird. Budgies can learn to talk quite well, with some able to develop a vocabulary consisting of hundreds of words. They also love to learn tricks and have the bonus of being quieter than most other hookbills. While Budgies certainly need space to play and exercise, they can be housed in much smaller cages than larger parrots like Macaws or Cockatoos. This makes them a common choice for apartment dwellers or those with cozier quarters.</p><p>Among the shortest for ""pet"" birds, captive budgies average seven to 15 years' lifespan.</p><h2>Parrotlets </h2><p>Susan C.0)</p><p></p><p>If a Budgie isn't quite what you are looking for, then you might consider the smallest parrot species on Earth--the lovely Parrotlet. Parrotlets come in several varieties, each with unique traits. However, one thing that they all have in common is that they can make wonderful pets with proper care. Parrotlets need a lot of socialization and exercise, so it's important that those who adopt them have lots of spare time to spend with them. Some can learn to talk, but even those that don't tend to have large personalities that shine through in their antics. After all, their closest cousins are the Amazon parrots, so it's no surprise that Parrotlets delight parrot lovers with their comical dispositions.</p><p>Parrotlets in captivity enjoy lifespans of 20 to 30 years--a longterm commitment for any pet owner considering adding one to their family.</p><h2>Lovebirds </h2><p>0)</p><p>Hailing from Africa, the beautiful colors that can be observed in Lovebird feathers are undoubtedly one of the things that make them such popular pets. They are simply stunning. Lovebirds come in a variety of types, but they can all make great pets with proper training and socialization. They don't normally learn to talk, but Lovebirds do enjoy learning tricks and can be delightful little performers in other respects. One common misconception about Lovebirds is that they must be kept in pairs--this is not the case at all. Most Lovebird owners have found that single Lovebirds tend to make better pets in general than pairs do. This is because single birds attach and bond with their owners instead of another bird.</p><p>Lovebirds' captive lifespans average 15 to 25 years, which should factor into your decision to make one part of your family.</p><h2>Small Conures </h2><p>0)</p><p>While the majority of them are medium-sized or larger birds, some small Conure species can be great choices for those looking for a small parrot. These include the Black-Capped Conures which are only 10 inches long, and the Half-Moon Conures, which are even smaller. While they can be louder than some of the other species listed here, they are extremely intelligent, bond strongly with their owners, and love to learn tricks and play games.</p><p>Conures also have long lifespans--captive lifespan for a healthy conure averages 20 years, so this should be a consideration in your decision-making process.</p><h2>Cockatiels </h2><p>While they are slightly larger than some of the other birds on this list, Cockatiels are a very popular species of small parrot that delight bird owners both young and old with their affectionate personalities and playful dispositions. Cockatiels love spending time with their owners, and they need plenty of time each day to come out of the cage to play, exercise, and socialize. Some have been known to learn to say a few words, but by and large Cockatiels seem to prefer to mimic household sounds such as telephones and doorbells rather than human speech. They are highly trainable and respond well to positive reinforcement.</p><p>Cockatiels typically enjoy a 15- to 25-year lifespan in captivity.</p>",751

While the media provides important information about the virus, myths and half-truths abound in discussion surrounding the avian flu. So to protect your bird and your family, it's critical to have a clear view of what the avian flu really is and how you can prevent it.</p><h2>Avian Flu Facts </h2><p>There are four primary types of influenza viruses: A, B, C, and D. Wild birds commonly carry type A viruses, of which there are more than 25 known subtypes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some of these subtypes can infect other species, including dogs and horses. And though it's not common for avian flu viruses to infect humans, it is possible. That's especially the case with the highly contagious subtype H5N1.</p><p>The H5N1 strain of the virus is one of the most serious and can be fatal to both birds and people. According to the World Health Organization, the case fatality rate for humans is just under 60 percent. Infected birds spread the virus through their saliva, mucus, feces, and blood. The birds also can contaminate their environment with the virus, where it can remain on surfaces, such as bird feeders and baths, for several days.</p><p>While H5N1 has been diagnosed primarily in chickens and other farm birds, it's possible for virtually any bird to contract the virus. And because migratory birds carry the virus, it can easily spread all around the world.</p><p>The most common symptoms in humans are fever, muscle aches, sore throat, and coughing. And progression to a severe respiratory infection can occur quickly, necessitating prompt treatment. Moreover, many birds will die rapidly before you even notice signs of illness.</p><h2>The Avian Flu and Pet Birds </h2><p>The risk of contracting avian flu is not particularly high for housebound pet birds. However, there are two factors that can cause the risk of infection to increase.</p><p>The first risk factor is if a pet bird spends any time outdoors, where it might come in contact with wild birds. To minimize the risk, do not allow your pet outside without supervision. Even if your bird is securely in its cage outdoors, watch it closely to keep wild birds and other animals away.</p><p>The second risk factor is the sale of wild-caught birds in the pet trade. On top of causing the wild birds severe trauma by ripping them away from their natural environment, this practice can play a role in introducing many diseases, including the avian flu, to people's homes and aviaries.</p><p>So if you are looking for a new bird, seek a reputable breeder or rescue group to ensure that your new pet is healthy. If you have recently purchased a bird that you suspect was captured from the wild, schedule an appointment with an avian veterinarian as soon as possible. Avian vets are capable of testing for the diseases specific to birds, such as the avian flu, and they can offer your bird treatment if necessary.</p><h2>Keeping Your Pet Bird Healthy </h2><p>One risk to a pet bird's health is improper care from its owner. Always wash your hands before and after handling your pet bird to mitigate the spread of any diseases. And make sure you're thoroughly cleaning its environment on a regular basis to remove feces, old food, and other waste that can potentially spread disease.</p><p>A quality diet is one of the primary ways to maximize a pet bird's healthy lifespan. In addition to nutritious seeds and pellets, make sure you're feeding your bird a mix of leafy greens and other vegetables, some fruits, grains, and nuts. Consult your veterinarian for the optimal diet for your specific bird.</p><p>Furthermore, provide your bird with plenty of space and toys to promote exercise. An overweight bird is at risk of many diseases. Plus, make sure your bird has ample social time, either with you or other pet birds (or both), to maintain its mental and physical health. And finally, schedule regular wellness checks with your avian vet. Birds can succumb to diseases very quickly, so it's important to closely monitor their health throughout their lives.</p>",769

This affectionate, cute bird is small and inexpensive, and if trained properly a budgie can mimic human speech. The origin of its formal namebudgerigaris a mystery, but by any name, this little bird is a charming companion for most pet owners.</p><p>Budgies aren't all fun and games, though, so before you bring one home, make sure you're not in for any surprises. Here are some key things to know about budgie birds.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Cute and Affectionate Budgie</h3><h2>All Budgies Are Parakeets, But Not All Parakeets Are Budgies</h2><p>Some people refer to budgies by their full name (budgerigars), and some call them parakeets. But while budgies are parakeets, there are many different types of parakeets, and they come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes. Some parakeets, like the Indian ringneck parakeet, are very largereaching lengths of up to 16 inches from head to tailwhile budgies are much smaller. Because of these vast differences in size and more, it is more accurate to refer to these birds by their true name.</p><h2>They're One of the Smallest True Parrot Species</h2><p>They're not the smallest parrotsthat distinction belongs to the parrotletbut budgies are quite tiny. Most budgies in captivity average between 7 or 8 inches from the beak to the tip of the tail. Wild budgies in their native habitat of Australia are even smaller.</p><h2>There Are Two Different Types</h2><p>Not many people realize that there are actually two distinct types of budgiesthe traditional Budgerigar, hailing from Australia, and the larger English budgie, bred in England specifically for the show and the pet trade. While the two are clearly both budgies, there are differences when they're observed side by side. English budgies are usually 1 to 2 inches longer than their Australian counterpartsand have larger heads and puffier feathers around their faces and crowns.</p><h2>Budgies Can Learn to Talk Better Than Some Larger Parrots</h2><p>There's no way to guarantee that your budgie, or any other parrot, will learn to ""speak."" However, budgies certainly have a knack for it, and many times they speak with greater clarity and broader vocabularies than larger parrot species such as macaws and cockatoos.</p><p>While their voices are small and gravelly-sounding, budgies have an impressive ability to pick up on human words and phrases, and even using them in proper context sometimes. They are a great choice for those new to bird ownership who want to owna talking parrot.</p><h2>Green Is the Only Natural Color for Budgies </h2><p>While people are normally accustomed to seeing a variety of colored budgies for sale in pet shops, the only natural color of budgies in the wild is the yellow/green variety. All other budgies, including the blue budgies, white budgies, and others, are color mutations bred specifically for the pet trade. There's nothing wrong with these birds, but don't expect to see a blue budgie in the wild.</p><h2>Try a Varied Diet</h2><p>Since they're small, budgies are relatively inexpensive to care for and feed. But contrary to popular belief, a diet consisting only of seeds is not good for a small bird like a budgie, and can even cause health problems. Instead, veterinarians recommend a budgie diet that includes pellets and fresh fruits and vegetables including leafy greens. It's OK to feed budgies a small amount of seeds as part of this diet, as long as the base of their diet is pellets, vegetables, and small amounts of fruit.</p><p> </p><p>Look at the stripes on its head: if they reach down to its beak, it's three to four months old.</p><p> </p><p>View the colors of its beak: darklike blackbeaks are a sign that your budgie is under 12 weeks old.</p><p> </p><p>Next, take a look at your bird's eyes: black eyes, with no visible irises, show the bird is less than five months old. If the budgie has a white iris ring, it's at least eight months old. </p><p>All budgies are parakeets, but not all parakeets are budgies. The most popular kind of parakeet is the budgerigar, nicknamed the budgie. Budgies are the most common parakeet, and they're native to Australia. </p><p>If your budgie is molting, it will be itchy. Give yours a shallow dish of water to use to bathe itself. You can also use a plant mister to give him a spritz.</p>",744
66,https://www.thesprucepets.com/are-parakeets-parrots-390501,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>Are Parakeets Parrots?</h1>,"<h1>Are Parakeets Parrots?</h1><p>The word ""parakeet"" is a descriptive term that refers to the long tails of these types of birds. There are many different kinds of parakeets available in the pet trade.</p><h2>A True Parrot </h2><p>The proper term for this popular and active little bird is ""budgerigar"". In some parts of the world, they are referred to as budgies. They are small birds with different color variations and two different sizes. There is the smaller standard budgerigar often called the Australian budgerigar or the American budgerigar and there isone a bit larger called the English Budgerigar.</p><p>Both are quite popular in many countries, as they are one of the most commonly kept species of birds. Native to Australia, they are indeed a true parrot. In the wild, they inhabit the drier semi-arid inland areas of the continent as well as the grasslands of the Southeast. They feed on grasses, grains, insects, and seeds. They were first bred for bird fanciers in the mid-1800s and quickly became a very fashionable pet to have in the household. Budgies in the wild are primarily green but early on, breeders began to selectively breed them for different colors and they are now available for sale or adoption in many different colors.</p><h2>Parakeet Facts </h2><p>In captivity, many people think that they only require bird seed purchased at the pet store and nothing could be further from the truth. Offering fresh vegetables or chop and fresh fruit as well as a formulated pelleted diet will help keep your budgie healthy.</p><p>Budgies are active birds and very playful. They enjoy roughhousing and if they are kept with another budgie they will often play together, rolling and tumbling about as well as sitting with each other taking turns preening each other.</p><p>The average lifespan of these delightful little parrots is anywhere from six to eighteen years. A healthy diet will add more years to your budgie's life so ensure you do research and learn how to provide a balanced diet. They enjoy playing with small toys as well as bells and other more delicate enrichment items. Remember, these are smart little birds and providing enrichment and foraging opportunities is important to their well being.</p><h2>Budgies in the Wild </h2><p>In the wild, they live in holes in trees where they roost at night as well as using it as a nest hole to raise and protect their young. They tend to favor dead or decaying eucalyptus trees. When providing a living space for them in your home, the larger the enclosure, the better. With budgies, think width as opposed to height when shopping for a cage for them. These little guys are good fliers and the wider the cage is, the better.</p><p>Since they originate from an arid part of Australia, they aren't instinctively drawn to taking a bath or shower. You could offer them a small bowl of water to bathe in. In the wild, they seem to enjoy rolling around in wet grass or wet leaves after rain to stay clean. So as an alternative, try offering wet lettuce leaves in a bowl or shallow pie pan and see if she will take you up on the offer by playing in the moist leaves.</p><p>They are quite social birds and will indeed bond with humans. This might not be true if you have a pair as they might bond with their partner and you end up taking the back seat. But if you get two budgies and this happens, don't be concerned. As long as they are happy, that is what matters.</p><h2>Parakeets as Pets </h2><p>They are notoriously good talkers. But their voices are very soft and they tend to talk rapidly so you might not recognize the fact that your budgie does indeed have a wonderful vocabulary.</p><p>These should not be considered ""starter birds."" Budgies should be recognized and respected for the species they are and for what they have to offer as a companion. Many people think that they will learn what they need to know about caring for a larger bird by caring for one of these wonderful little guys. This isn't the case at all; these birds are not training wheels. If you want a fabulous little companion parrot that is active, playful and full of life and fun you might want to take a second look at a budgie.</p><p>Most Parakeets make wonderful pets, are highly trainable, and many become excellent talkers! With all the differenttypes of parakeetsthat are out there, it shouldn't be too hard to find one that isthe right bird for you.</p>",752

Not everyone can meet their care needs, as they prefer a lot of attention. But for the right person, a quaker parrot can make an affectionate and entertaining companion. Before you bring a quaker into your home, first it's important to fully understand this charming parrot species.</p><h2>Quakers Are Known by Several Names </h2><p>While they are most commonly called quaker parrots, these birds have some alternate names. You will often hear the species referred to as quaker parakeets, monk parrots, or monk parakeets. The scientific name of the species is .</p><p>Some people say quakers got their name because of the gray on the front of their necks that looks like an old-fashioned Quaker bib. (People also say the monk name came from the color going up the back of the bird's head like a monk's hood.) But most people attribute the quaker's name to the bird's distinctive ""quaking"" motions. These birds bob and shake (or quake) in a unique way, especially when they're excited or irritated. Baby quakers often quake when they're begging for food.</p><h2>Quaker Parrots Can Live for a Very Long Time </h2><p>Like many parrot species, quaker parrots can enjoy a particularly long lifespan in captivity. Their average lifespan is between 20 and 30 years. But with quality care, some quaker parrots can live for more than 30 years.</p><p>If you're considering a quaker, ensure that you have a plan to care for the bird for its entire life. Quakers are a very social species, bonding closely with their owners. So it is difficult for them to handle being bounced from home to home when people have to give them up. In fact, one of the few times quakers might become aggressive or resort to unhealthy behaviors, such as feather plucking, is when they feel neglected or stressed, which is often the case when they lose their home.</p><h2>Quaker Parrots Are Excellent Talkers </h2><p></p><p>If you're looking to adopt a bird that can talk, then a quaker parrot might be right up your alley. Quakers are known for their exceptional ability to mimic human speech. Not only can they learn a diverse vocabulary of words and sounds, but they also tend to be able to speak very clearly and often rival larger parrot species in terms of the clarity of their voices.</p><p>While not every quaker parrot is guaranteed to talk, individual birds have greater odds of excelling at mimicry than birds of many other species. Overall, many owners say their quakers are little chatterboxes when it comes to mimicking, as well as their natural calls. It's usually not enough to bother neighbors because they don't have the ear-piercing screams of some other species, such as conures. But they will make their presence known in a home.</p><h2>Quakers Are Relatively Small </h2><p>Some people might be deterred from adopting a parrot because they assume they're all large birds that need a vast amount of space. However, quakers are just one of the many types of medium-sized birds that prove that notion wrong. Quakers are around 11 to 12 inches long and weigh just 3 to 5 ounces.</p><p>While it's true that all birds need as spacious of an enclosure as possible, as well as space outside of the enclosure to play, quakers and similarly sized species can do well with less space than a large bird, such as a macaw. Make sure your quaker's housing is sturdy and avian-safe, as these birds are known to chew and to learn how to open cage doors. They also tend to have a strong nest-building instinct. So in addition to toys, offer them bird-safe materials with which they can make a nest if they wish.</p><h2>Quakers Need a Varied Diet </h2><p>Like some other bird species, such as cockatoos and Amazons, quaker parrots tend to become overweight if their diets aren't closely monitored. In addition to a high-quality pellet and healthy seed mix, offer fresh vegetables, fruits, and nuts. This mimics what they would eat in the wild.</p><p>The occasional millet sprig is typically fine as a treat for a healthy bird. But don't overdo it with fattening nuts and seeds, such as peanuts and sunflower seeds, in their diet.These treats can cause rapid weight gain when offered freely.</p><p>Quaker parrots cost from $300 to $600.</p><p>Quaker parrots are originally from Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, and Paraguay.</p><p>Female quaker parrots are able to lay eggs once they are six months old.</p>",748
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/parrot-lice-what-you-should-know-390435,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>How to Identify and Get Rid of Parrot Lice</h1>,"<h1>How to Identify and Get Rid of Parrot Lice</h1><p>We know that birds are susceptible to many of the same health problems that can affect people, including viruses and bacterial infections. Did you know, however, that birds can also get lice? Not only thatthere are specific types of lice that have developed to affect parrots exclusively. Learn all about these creepy crawly parasites, how to identify them, and how to get rid of them in this article on parrot lice. Keep your feathered friend and the rest of your family healthy and safe by learning what you can do to prevent lice and other external parasites.</p><h2>Identifying Parrot Lice </h2><p>Just because you see tiny bugs crawling around on your bird does not automatically mean that your parrot has lice. In addition to lice, birds can become infested with mites or other types of external parasites. In general, lice infestations appear as small, brownish colored insects that can be seen traveling through your bird's feathers. You may not even be able to see the lice with the naked eyein many cases, owners only notice excessive itching in their birds. In order to properly identify lice or any parasite with absolute certainty, it's important to promptly schedule an appointment with an avian vet if you notice any type of abnormal behavior or insects crawling around on your bird.</p><h2>Protecting Other Pets </h2><p>If you live in a multiple-bird household, then it is extra important for you to identify and treat any form of parasite infestation as quickly as possible, in order to reduce the risk of exposing your other birds. If you do notice external parasites on one of your pets, quickly quarantine the affected bird in a safe area away from your other feathered friends. Even if you do not observe lice or other parasites on your other birds, it's probably a good idea to get your entire flock checked out by a veterinarian so that you can be sure to get any infestations under control.</p><h2>Can People Get Bird Lice? </h2><p>One of the most common questions that bird owners have about bird lice is whether or not the insects can transfer to human hosts. The good news is that bird lice are exclusive to birds, and will not infest human hair. However, this does not mean that the lice can't harm a bird's human family members. Lice can carry a host of diseases so refer to your human doctor for more information if you live in a household that has parrot lice. Limit physical contact with an infected bird until you can seek proper veterinary treatment for your pet.</p><h2>Preventing Reinfestation </h2><p>Once you've identified lice on your bird and set up a vet visit for your pet, the work is not done. While your bird's veterinarian will offer a delousing treatment for your feathered friend, bringing your bird back into your home can cause the lice to quickly reappear if you haven't properly eliminated them. The first thing that you should do is thoroughly clean your bird's cage, making sure to scrub and disinfect all surfaces, corners, and nooks and crannies of the bars. In addition, it may be necessary to contact a professional home pest control service to spray your house for lice and other parasites. Ensure your feathered friend is not in the house during the home pest control service as the fumes can be dangerous to your pet and for a few hours or more (talk to the company you are working with) afterwards while the house is clearing out . While this isn't exactly a pleasant undertaking, it's better than dealing with repeated infestations on your feathered friend.</p><h2>Avoid ""Over the Counter"" Treatments </h2><p>Between vet bills, pest control services, and other expenses, it's safe to say that it's not cheap to get rid of pet bird licehowever, please don't let the cost of effective treatment cause you to cut corners by using inferior products that you can buy at the grocery store. Most ""do it yourself"" pest control chemicals can be harmful or fatal to birds, as can treatments that are labeled for the removal of human head lice infestations. Do yourself and your bird a favor and seek professional help (even if its a call to a clinic for thoughts on what to do) as soon as you suspect a lice infestation in your pet.</p><p>How Often Do I Need to Worm My Pet Bird or Treat It for Mites and Lice?</p><p>External Parasites in Birds. , 2020</p>",744
69,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-potty-train-pet-bird-390284,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Potty Train Your Pet Bird</h1>,"<h1>How to Potty Train Your Pet Bird</h1><h2>Potty Training Made Easy!</h2><p>Ah, bird poop. It's one of those necessary evils of bird ownership that you must learn to live with. The good news is that although many claim that there is no way to ""housebreak"" or ""potty train"" a bird, there are in fact ways to teach your pet the proper places to relieve itselfsun conures are a perfect example. While it won't happen overnight and can be a bit more complicated than teaching a cat or dog, many owners find that the benefits of such training are well worth the effort.</p><h2>Train Yourself </h2><p>The first step in potty training your bird is to train yourself. Each day when you interact with your pet, pay close attention to any ""signals"" the bird may give you before relieving himself. These can be as subtle as a change in posture, a certain ""look"" in the bird's eyes, or a ruffling of tailfeathers. Some birds become restless when sitting quietly in one spot for a long time and this can indicate they need to go to the bathroom. Every bird is different, and will thus use different body language, but if you know your bird and learn to ""read"" it, it won't take you long to catch on.</p><h2>Pay Attention </h2><p>Another thing to pay attention to is the frequency of your bird's droppings. Many birds will use the bathroom as often as every five or 10 minutes, but again, this is highly individual. If you watch your bird, you may begin to see a pattern in its restroom habits, and if you take note of the amount of time it takes between poops, you will be better at judging when your bird is ready for a potty break.</p><h2>Find Places to Go </h2><p>Once you've gotten a good idea of your bird's natural bathroom schedule, you can begin to work with your bird on learning the right places to go potty. The first thing to do is to decide where you want your bird to relieve itself. This can be any number of places, such as the bird's cage, a garbage can, or a piece of newspaper or cage liner. Whatever you decide on, it's important to stick with it as much as possible. Many bird owners train their pets to potty on a piece of waste paper, as this is the most portable and easily disposed of.</p><p>When you've chosen the proper place, the only thing you must do is take your bird to it (or if it's a piece of paper, hold it under the bird) when it's time to go potty sounds simple, right? The trick is anticipating the bird's need to use the bathroom, which is where knowing your bird's potty habits comes into play. If, for example, you noticed that your bird relieves itself about every seven minutes, then you should place your bird over its designated poop space every seven minutes. There may be times when your bird does not need to poop as often as normal, and that's okayif you notice that your bird hasn't pooped after being held over the potty space for a minute or two, let it resume playing, and just try again after one to three minutes have passed.</p><h2>Give Praise </h2><p>When your bird uses the bathroom in the correct area, be sure to praise it with kind words and tasty treats. As time passes, it will begin to understand that pooping in the right place yields great rewards. This can take many months of training, however, so don't be surprised if your bird has a few accidents, and don't be angry with your pet if it ""misses the spot"". Remember, it's your responsibility to pay attention to your bird's body language and schedule, and get the bird to the proper place to go potty.</p><p>With persistence and plenty of positive reinforcement, many birds take to potty training quite readily and quickly learn that pooping on humans (or furniture) is not encouraged. While it does require effort on the part of the owner to make sure that accidents don't occur, most claim that it's much easier than tending to the laundry and messes that un-trained birds create. Have fun with your bird and make potty training a learning experience for both of youand never again worry about losing your favorite shirt to a ""bird bomb""! (And if your bird does have an accident on your favorite shirt, know how to clean bird poop out of clothing.)</p>",745
70,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-owls-make-good-pets-390707,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>Do Owls Make Good Pets?</h1>,"<h1>Do Owls Make Good Pets?</h1><p>In many movies, books, and TV shows, owls are shown to be incredibly friendly, intelligent, and affectionate pets. Do owls make good pets like they seem to in the movies, and if so, what does it take to properly care for one? Can you keep one in a regular parrot cage and feed it seed and other types of commercial bird food?</p><h2>Owls Need Lots of Space </h2><p>While it's true that pet owls have been popularized in books and movies (such as the  series), the truth is that owls are not a good choice for pets. The hardships caused by properly caring for an owl are a big reason why it is best to leave them in the wild, as beautiful and captivating as these creatures may be.</p><p>For starters, owls cannot be kept inside a standard indoor parrot cage. They must be kept in a large aviary with both indoor and outdoor access, as well as access to a bath pan that must be kept clean. They bathe regularly in order to keep their feathers meticulously clean. Owls fly silently, but their feathers will make noise if they are not kept clean. This noise is detrimental to their hunting. They also must be able to fly frequently if they are indeed physically able to fly.</p><h3>What You Need to Know About Owls as Pets</h3><h2>Owls Are Mostly Independent Creatures </h2><p>These birds are raptors that live and hunt independently. Unlike other types of large birds like macaws or cockatoos, owls do not live in flocks in the wild, making them extremely antisocial when it comes to other birds (except for their mates and their offspring).</p><p>The flock mentality is what allows a parrot to successfully integrate itself into a human family. Since owls lack that sort of mindset, they view everyone except for the one person they choose as their ""mate"" as an enemy or prey, and will likely attack others on sight. This can be a huge problem if you ever become sick or otherwise unable to care for your owl.</p><h2>Their Diets Are Specialized </h2><p>Diet is another concern that makes it nearly impossible to successfully keep owls as pets. Since owls are technically a bird of prey, they have specialized nutritional needs that cannot be met by feeding them seeds, pelletsor fresh foods like fruits and vegetables.As a matter of fact, if you presented any of these treats to an owl, he or she would likely not even recognize them as food. Owls are carnivorous creatures and must be fed whole rodents, like mice, small rabbits, guinea pigs, quail and small chickens that are commercially produced in order to meet their complex dietary needs, and must be stored frozen and then thawed before feeding or fed live. As one might imagine, this can be a less than pleasant ordeal to witness, much less to have to take part in several times per day. Like all birds, owls can be quite messy eaters, so cleaning up after meals is another chore that most people would find hard to stomach.</p><p>As meat eaters, owls are equipped with a beak and talons that are specifically designed for ripping and tearing chunks of meatand they are capable of doing quite a bit of damage to human owners if they become displeased for any reason. They are destructive and can easily rip apart anything you might have in their enclosure.</p><h2>Owls AreIllegal to Own as Pets </h2><p>It is illegal to keep owls in many areas of the world. Those who choose to defy the law and keep an owl anyway face a variety of additional problems. If the bird falls ill, there is usually no choice but to take it to a veterinarian who specializes in raptors. Your standard vet is not specially trained to treat these amazing birds. Taking an owl to a veterinarian puts an illegal owner at risk of being caught, fined and possibly jailed, as you need a permit and extensive training to become a certified and bonded professional raptor handler.</p><h2>Other Options </h2><p>If you are interested in owls, you may sponsor one at a wildlife care center.If you are looking for a companion bird, consider adopting a parrot who needs a home. They are far better suited to life with a human family than an owl.</p><p>Barn Owl Trust. . Pelagic Publishing, 2012 </p><p>Scott, David E. . CABI, 2016</p><p>Desmarchelier, Marion.

71,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-paint-a-bird-cage-1238443,Birds > Pet Bird Supplies > Bird Cages & Stands,<h1>How To Paint a Bird Cage</h1>,"<h1>How To Paint a Bird Cage</h1><p>Birds and other exotic pets require safe and secure cages. Often times safe and secure cages for large exotic pets, such as birds, can be very expensive. To avoid incurring some of these costs, consider repainting an older cage. Find out how to paint a birdcage, and consider the steps to take to make sure you get the job done right.</p><h2>Supplies Needed </h2><h2>Preparing the Cage </h2><p>So, you have your cage. Perhaps it was donated to you or your organization, a yard sale find, or one you've had for some time that is just in need of a makeover. But regardless of the route of acquisition, your cage needs to be painted.</p><p>Before slapping some paint on that cage, it needs to be prepped for its new identity. The surface of all metal being painted needs to be clean, smooth, and free of all rust. Use your wire brush to get all the rust flakes off the cage and your sandpaper to smooth the surfaces after using the brush. Any other rough or uneven spots on the metal should be smoothed at this point as well.</p><p>After getting rid of all the rough spots and rust with your wire brush and sandpaper, you should clean the cage. Use your cleaning cloths or just give your cage a bath with some water to get rid of all the dust and debris.</p><p>The last step before actually painting your cage is applying a thin primer coat. Read more on choosing a primer and paint in the next section.</p><h2>Choosing the Paint </h2><p>Almost all store-bought cages have been powder coated using thermoplastic material that is melted onto the cage at a very high temperature. Some owners feel powder coated cages chip more easily than painted cages while others feel they are easier to clean, and the material is harder than paint. Whatever your opinion is on powder coating, it isn't an option for most bird owners to do at home.</p><p>The reason why paint is so toxic to birds is because of the possible lead, zinc, VOC's and other toxins the paint emits. If you remove these danger factors from the picture, your paint should theoretically be bird-safe. There are more and more brands that are now offering these ""non-toxic,"" ""zero-VOC,"" and other safer paints. Your best choice would be a paint that has zero VOC's, even after the tint color is added (you don't need to worry about the tint if you want to paint the cage white), is lead, zinc, and chromate-free, and as all-natural as possible. The Green Seal Standard should be visible on the paint you choose. There are even water-based, organic paints available, which are probably your safest options or some homemade paint recipes. Make sure the paint you choose also bonds to metal and is fast-drying.</p><h2>Painting the Bird Cage </h2><p>By now, I would assume your bird isn't in the cage anymore. This is good. And he won't be able to be in his cage for some time. Depending on what paint you use, your bird may have to be in a temporary cage and room for about 2 weeks to allow the paint to cure.</p><p>After choosing a safe primer and paint for your birdcage, apply a thin coat of the primer. Allow at least 24 hours for the primer to dry before applying your paint. Three coats of glossy paint can then be applied to the cage with a 24 hour period between each coat of gloss. Make sure you keep your coats of paint thinner, and don't let it drip. Again, keep your bird out of the room, regardless of how safe the paint is. You can never be too safe.</p><h2>Returning Your Bird to the Cage </h2><p>Solvent-based paints will take longer to cure than water-based paints, so you may not be able to return your bird to his cage for a couple of weeks. If you can, always wait a little longer than required.</p><p>To discourage your bird from chewing on the newly painted cage, try attaching perches, ropes, and other things your bird can grab onto on the sides of the cage using wire. These will act as ""handles"" for your bird to grasp with his beak while climbing up the cage sides instead of the cage bars. So basically, you are creating alternative cage bars on top of the real cage bars at different angles.</p>",729

You aren't alone -- pet birds rank 3rd as the most popular pets in the world behind cats and dogs. But what if you already own a cat, a dog, or both? Can a parrot learn to get along with other animals that are already established pets in a household? Read on to learn more about integrating a pet parrot into a home that already has pets.</p><h2>Is It Safe to Mix Parrots with Other Animals? </h2><p>The short answer is, not really. Common household pets like cats and dogs are naturally predatory creatures. In the wild, parrots and other birds fall beneath them on the food chain, so it is likely in most homes that the same rules would apply. This is not to say that there aren't hundreds of households who successfully keep birds with cats and dogs, because there are. However, in most of these situations, the pet owners have special circumstances that allow them to supervise their animals properly and ensure that there are no opportunities for a cat or dog to harm their bird. Perhaps they work from home or don't work at all, or perhaps the way their home is designed allows them to make sure that their birds are kept separate from their other pets. When deciding whether or not to adopt birds into a home with existing pets, it's important to consider whether or not you have the time and space necessary to make sure that interactions between the animals are kept to an absolute minimum.</p><p>In addition to the dangers posed to birds by predatory animals, there is also the risk of zoonotic diseases that can be passed back and forth between cats, dogs, and birds. Birds are very fragile and sensitive creatures health-wise, and there are certain viruses and bacteria that could be fatal to them if they are kept in close quarters with other pets. In fact, even being exposed to a single cat hair can cause illness in some birds. Potential owners need to consider these risks before adopting a bird into an already pet-filled home.</p><h2>What If I Can Supervise My Pets Constantly? </h2><p>Being able to provide your pets constant supervision is a great way to cut down on the dangers to a bird in a multiple-pet household, but supervision does not equal love and attention. Pet birds, especially parrots, need lots of time to play and socialize with their owners in order to form an effective bond with them. If you are continually watching all your pets to make sure that they aren't hurting each other, you aren't going to be able to focus your attention solely on your parrot. On the flip side, will your other pets feel neglected if you are spending too much time with the new bird? Many pet owners find that keeping multiple pets of different species causes them to be spread so thin that the quality of their relationships with each of the pets suffers. Even those who feel that they have more than enough love to give multiple pets can find that they don't have the  to give it. There's nothing good about owning a pet that you can't have a meaningful relationship with. Ultimately, the decision is up to you, but it is advised that you think long and hard about these points and honestly ask yourself if you are up to the challenge.</p><p>If after considering these points you are still serious about adopting a pet parrot, talk with bird breeders in your area about their experiences keeping parrots with other animals. If you can, visit with people who live in multiple-pet households, and see how they manage their time and attention where the pets are concerned. In the end, you may find that you are one of the rare few who can find a happy balance within your home and successfully keep parrots with other pets, but if you are not, don't get discouraged. You can always go volunteer at a bird shelter or rescue if you crave some ""parrot time,"" or join a local bird club and meet others who share your passion for parrots. There is also nothing wrong with making plans to adopt a parrot in the future when there aren't other pets in the picture -- parrots are popular with people, and it looks like that's a fact that's here to stay!</p>",737

One day your parrot is a sweet, tame, happy member of your family, and the next he or she is acting like a vicious little monster. The most common reason for these sorts of personality changes is that your bird is going through a hormonal period due to the mating season. Read on to discover some of the most common signs of hormonal behavior in birds and how to cope until your pet's behavior subsides.</p><h2>Screaming </h2><p>While all pet birds can be noisy, many owners note a dramatic increase in screaming and general vocalizations when their pets are going through a hormonal period. This is normal and to be expected. Many owners find hormonal vocalizations to be the most off-putting part of dealing with their birds during mating season, but try to resist the urge to scold your bird for being louder than usual. Doing so will likely only encourage the behavior. Your best bet is to invest in a good pair of earplugs and attempt to ignore your bird's screams until mating season subsides. If you feel as if the screaming has become a habit that has outlasted your bird's hormonal surges, consult with a behavior specialist for ideas on how to calm your noisy pet.</p><h2>Biting</h2><p>One of the surest signs of hormonal behavior is when a normally tame and sweet bird suddenly starts trying to bite. Often referred to as ""bluffing,"" this sort of display, all too often, is the reason that many bird owners cite for surrendering their parrots to shelters and rescues. It can be quite frightening (and painful) for owners to deal with the biting stage of hormonal behavior, but take heart; it will pass with time. Because bird spay and neutering is a high risk surgery, it is normal for birds to lash out when trying to cope with sexual frustration while being sexually intact. The best way to deal with biting behavior is to work around it the best you can, without sacrificing time that you would normally spend bonding with your pet.</p><h2>Territoriality </h2><p>If your bird seems more territorial than usual, that can also be a strong sign that its hormones are coming into play as well. A hormonal bird may become very possessive over their cage, food, toys, or even their favorite human until the mating season comes to an end. Once territoriality is recognized, it would behoove most bird owners to respect their pet's mindset regarding what they are being possessive over, lest they risk being on the receiving end of a painful bite. If it seems that your bird's territoriality issues are becoming a lasting problem outside of mating season (typically spring for most species), then you may want to consider contacting a Certified Parrot Behavior Consultant for help and advice on how to work through your bird's problems.</p><h2>Mating Displays </h2><p>If your bird is going through a hormonal period, you may notice some awkward new ways in which the bird carries itself or odd physical displays when the bird is interacting with you. These can include eye pinning, regurgitation, and displays, such as wing flapping or tail fanning. For example, male Indian ringneck parakeets are known to perform a cute ""bowing"" display during mating season when they are attempting to woo a potential mate. Don't be surprised if your bird attempts to ""win you over"" with displays such as this. To your bird, you are a flock-mate and an equal. This redirection of sexual behavior towards a human shouldn't be promoted; it can lead to sexual frustration. When you bird displays these behaviors, place it back in its cage or on a perch away from you to let you bird calm down. As with all hormonal behaviors, this too will pass in time.</p><h2>Feather Plucking </h2><p>Some bird owners have noticed that their birds over-preen themselves and even engage in feather-plucking during mating season. While this is a nesting behavior and considered normal, owners need to realize that feather plucking can become a serious habit in birds, and can even be a potential symptom of serious illness. To be on the safe side, it is best to have your bird checked out by an avian veterinarian if you begin to notice any abnormal plucking behavior.</p>",725

While sharing food with your bird is a lot of fun and can be wonderful for your pet's emotional health, there are many common human foods that can be harmful or even fatal to your bird. Owners need to know which foods are fine for sharing and which pose a serious risk.</p><h2>Chocolate </h2><p>Chocolate is a wonderful treat to share with human family members, but it can be harmful or fatal to your pet bird. Chocolate poisoning first affects a bird's digestive system, causing vomiting and diarrhea. As the condition progresses, the bird's central nervous system is affected, first causing seizures and eventually death.</p><h2>Apple Seeds </h2><p>Apples, along with other members of the rose family including cherries, peaches, apricots, and pears contain trace amounts of cyanide within their seeds. While the fruit of the apple is fine for your bird, be aware that in addition to the poisonous seeds, there may be pesticides present on the fruit's skin.</p><p>Thoroughly clean and core any apple pieces that you share with your bird to avoid exposure to these toxins.</p><h2>Alcohol </h2><p>Although responsible bird owners would never dream of offering their pet an alcoholic drink, there have been instances in which free-roaming birds have attained alcohol poisoning by helping themselves to unattended cocktails. Just like with humans, too much alcohol ingestion can be fatal.</p><p>Alcohol depresses the organ systems of birds and can be fatal. Whenever alcohol is being served in your home, keep your bird safe and secure it in its cage.</p><h2>Salt </h2><p>While all living beings need regulated amounts of sodium in their systems, too much salt can lead to a host of health problems in birds, including excessive thirst, dehydration, kidney dysfunction, and death.</p><p>Keep watch over the number of salty foods your bird consumes.</p><h2>Avocado </h2><p>The skin and pit of this popular fruit have been known to cause cardiac distress and eventual heart failure in pet bird species. Although there is some debate about the degree of toxicity of avocados, it is generally advised to adopt a ""better safe than sorry"" attitude toward them. Keep guacamole and other avocado products as far away from pet birds as possible.</p><h2>Mushrooms </h2><p>Mushrooms are a type of fungus and have been known to cause digestive upset in companion birds. Caps and stems of some varieties can induce liver failure in animals. Don't let your pet bird consume raw or cooked mushrooms.</p><h2>Tomato Leaves </h2><p>Tomatoes, like potatoes and other nightshades, have a tasty fruit that is fine as a treat for your bird. The stems, vines, and leaves, however, are highly toxic to your pet.</p><p>When you offer your bird a tomato treat, make sure it has been properly cleaned and sliced with the green parts removedso that your bird will avoid exposure to toxins. Due to their high acidic content, tomatoes aren't the best option; there are many other vegetables that you can feed your bird.</p><h2>Caffeine </h2><p>Caffeinated beverages such as soda, coffee, and tea are popular among people, but allowing your bird to indulge in these drinks can be extremely hazardous. Caffeine causes cardiac malfunctions in birdsand is associated with increased heartbeat, arrhythmia, hyperactivity, and cardiac arrest.</p><p>Instead, share a healthy drink of pure fruit or vegetable juice or a fresh smoothie with your bird. This will satisfy both your bird's taste buds and nutritional requirements.</p><h2>Onions </h2><p>While limited amounts of onion or garlic powders as flavorings are generally regarded as acceptable, excessive consumption of onions causes vomiting, diarrhea, and a host of other digestive problems in pet birds. It has been found that prolonged exposure can lead to a blood condition called hemolytic anemia, which is followed by respiratory distress and eventual death.</p><h2>Dried Beans </h2><p>Cooked beans are a favorite treat of many birds, but raw, dry beans can be extremely harmful to your pet. Uncooked beans contain a poison called hemagglutininwhich is very toxic to birds.</p><p>To avoid exposure, thoroughly cook any beans that you choose to share with your bird and avoid leaving dried beans in an easily accessible location.</p>",707
75,https://www.thesprucepets.com/caution-the-parrot-bites-390280,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Stop Your Parrot From Biting</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Your Parrot From Biting</h1><p>Biting parrots are far more common than you may think. All pet birds bite. While this is not to say that all birds are aggressive, it should serve as a fair warning to anyone interested in owning a parrot or another type of pet bird. Sooner or later, you're likely to get bitten and it will be painful.</p><h2>Why Do Parrots Bite? </h2><p>Just because a bird bites you doesn't mean that the bird is mean, aggressive, or isn't bonded to you. Parrots, as hookbills, use their beaks for a variety of functions: preening, eating, climbing, and playing. Parrots often use their beaks in the place of a hand to grab onto toys, food, perches, and sometimes their owners. If your bird is normally good-natured, you may need to evaluate whether or not your parrot is  biting you or is simply using its beak in a normal, healthy fashion.</p><h2>Fear </h2><p>Another possibility is that your bird could be biting you out of fear. Even parrots that were hand-fed as babies can develop a fear of humans if they are not properly socialized consistently. If your bird came into your life as an adult, there are any number of factors it may have come into contact with that can cause fear biting. Even well-socialized birds that are completely comfortable with humans can become frightened of something and bite their owner out of impulse. Learning how to earn your bird's trust can help quell your bird's fears and save you a few sore fingertips.</p><h2>Aggression </h2><p>If you can determine that your parrot is not playing, trying to climb, attempting to preen you, or isn't simply afraid, then aggression may well be at the root of your bird's biting. Aggression in parrots can be a serious problem, leading to unhappy birds and even unhappier owners. Causes of aggression in parrots include territoriality, hormonal fluxes during adolescence or breeding season, stress, lack of mental stimulation, and dominance issues, to name a few.</p><p>Take steps to eliminate any obvious factors that may contribute to your bird's aggression.</p><p>Make adjustments as necessary and monitor your bird's response. Causes of aggressive biting can sometimes be tricky to identify, so it's always a good idea to schedule an appointment with an avian veterinarian to rule out any health issues that may contribute to your bird's undesirable behavior.</p><h2>How to Stop the Biting </h2><p>Owning a parrot that bites out of fear or aggression is no fun. Not only are bites physically dangerous due to the power of a parrot's beak, but they are a sign that the bird itself is unhappy with some aspect of its situation. Every pet bird owner wants to make sure their feathered friends are happy. When problem behaviors such as biting rear their head, it's important to act quickly to remedy the problem before long-term patterns of these behaviors set in.</p><h2>Next Steps </h2><p>If you want a pet bird that you can handle and interact with, you will eventually get bitten at some point. The key to dealing with bites is to monitor your bird's behavior patterns and provide consistent training to pinpoint the cause of the undesirable behavior and fix it.</p><p>Even in temporary bouts of biting behavior such as the""bluffing"" phenomenon, it's important to stick to a set training schedule so that you can disrupt the potential onset of a pattern of behavioral issues. Failure to do so could cost you your relationship with your bird.</p><h2>Take Caution </h2><p>While you're managing your biting bird, be cautious. Bites aren't only painful, but they can also be severe. While rare, parrot owners have lost eyes, fingers, and toes to their pet birds, while others have sustained traumatic injuries to their lips, ears, and noses.</p><p>Large parrots have very powerful beaks, and owners must realize that even sweet, tame pets can cause these sorts of severe injuries in the blink of an eye if they get frightened or otherwise upset. These situations can be particularly tragic if kids are involved, so bird lovers with little ones at home should be particularly careful about choosing a parrot species that will make a good pet bird for children.</p>",701

Different people have different ways of dealing with grief and loss, but there are some general things that you can do in order to make it easier to cope with. Read on to discover some of the many ways that pet owners around the world have learned to deal with the death of their beloved animals. Hopefully, you'll be able to take comfort in some of the ideas you'll learn about during your time of loss.</p><h2>Have a Funeral for Your Bird </h2><p>Some people may say that having a funeral for an animal is silly or unnecessary, but the truth is that many pet owners find comfort in having a funeral for pets that they have lost, especially those who have families with young children. Choose an appropriate place to bury your bird and invite close friends and family or take some time to quietly remember your feathered friend all by yourself. Some people choose to recite certain prayers or poetry or play some music that reminds them of their pets. No matter how you conduct your bird's funeral, the important part is that it gives you closure and the chance to formally say goodbye.</p><h2>Create a Memorial Website </h2><p>Online memorials have gained popularity in recent years for both pets and people. Not only will building an online memorial give you time to reflect on happy memories that you made with your pet, but it will also offer you a permanent place that you can go to revisit those memories anytime you wish thereafter. Many people choose to create online memorials full of photos and videos of their departed pets and then share the link with friends and family so that they too can remember the precious life that was lost and offer their condolences. There are even several memorial websites that will allow you to create a page for your pet absolutely free of charge.</p><h2>Remove Items Reminding You of Your Pet </h2><p>In the days immediately following the loss of a pet, many people find it too hard to deal with seeing familiar sights that remind them of their loss. In the case of a pet bird, you may find it helpful to remove his or her cage, toys, and other belongings from their normal places and store them out of sight until you feel better, or even give them away to a shelter or bird rescue. It is hard enough to get through the days following the loss of a pet bird without hearing their sweet voices, let alone having to look at an empty cage. Ask yourself if removing your bird's belongings would help you cope with the loss, and if it will, do so or ask a friend or family member to come help take care of it for you.</p><h2>Make a Creative Tribute </h2><p>Many people who are dealing with loss find it comforting to make a creative tribute in memory of their pet. Are you a writer, a painter, or a musician? Try writing a poem, painting a picture, or composing a song in memory of your beloved feathered friend. It has been said that creating art of any kind is a great way to work out internal feelings involving these types of tragic situations. Creating a fitting tribute to your pet can help give you the closure that you need in order to be able to move on.</p><h2>Allow Yourself to Grieve </h2><p>No matter how you choose to remember your pet, keep in mind that it is normal and okay to experience feelings of grief for some time. It can take months for some people to work through the grieving process, and the truth is, a portion of the pain will never quite go away. It will eventually be easier to deal with though, and one day you'll be able to look back on the memories of your pet bird without feeling quite so overwhelmed with sadness. Once you have reached that point, you may consider adopting a new pet bird to share your life with.</p>",710

After all, parrots are birds and they lay eggs to procreate, but it really isn't at all unusual for birds in the wild to eat other species' eggs.Eggs are a completely natural food and are good for your birdsthey have no carbohydrates and no sugarbut, as with anything, moderation is key to a healthy flock.</p><h2>Wild Animals and Eggs </h2><p>Eggs are really nutritious and animals of all kinds will steal eggs if they can find them. Raccoons, foxes, snakes, and hedgehogs will all go after an egg if they can find one.</p><p>Crows are notorious egg thieves and how they consume a wild egg is pretty interesting. They make a small hole in the shell by piercing the shell with their beaks on one end or on the side. They then insert their upper beak into the egg and lift it up so the contents are drained into his beak.</p><p>Gulls are known to eat eggs as well and they don't even bother trying to fly off with it. They simply settle in on the nest where they found the egg and eat it right there.</p><h2>Nutrition </h2><p>Eggs are a powerful food that feeds the brains of these sharp creatures. It takes a certain amount of intelligence to survive in the wild, so a meal from an egg is a good choice. Egg yolks contain choline which is a serious brain food because it makes rapid thinking far easier by speeding up the relay signals in the brain. The choline found in eggs also aid liver function and transferring and distributing nutrients throughout the body where it is needed.</p><p>The protein found in an egg is also a valuable ingredient because protein contributes amino acids to help the brain function. It does this by creating neurotransmitters which deliver the messages to the neurons which allow that quick thinking needed in the wild for survival. The typical chicken egg is made up of about 12% protein. An egg also contains all of the essential amino acids. An essential amino acid is one where the body cannot manufacture it on its own. It must be absorbed by consuming food that contains those essential amino acids.</p><p>The eggshell is an excellent source of calcium which is sparse in the wild. This calcium is valuable to a bird because a female is going to need it if she lay eggs of her own. The calcium she consumes helps form a stronger shell for those eggs she wants to lay. She has to seek it out any way she can and eggs are a pretty easy way to get it. That egg isn't her egg so she really doesn't care about it. All that wild bird cares about is feeding herself and laying healthy eggs with strong shells.</p><p>Years ago, it was thought that eggs were extremely high in cholesterol.However, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has learned since this original finding that eggs aren't that high in cholesterol after all. They learned that the cholesterol in an egg is actually 14% lower than they originally thought and that eggscontain more Vitamin D than originally thought by an increase of 64%.</p><h2>Feeding Pet Bird </h2><p>Eggs are an inexpensive form of protein and birds can eat the entire egg: the white, the yolk, as well as the shell. Cleaned and packaged crushed eggshell is available on the market and available to companion bird families who are interested in feeding the shell to their flocks to increase their calcium level.</p><p>Twin Beaks Aviary has a product called Hatched! Eggshell. It is a source of 100% calcium and it's available online if you are more interested in feeding just the shells rather than the entire egg. The eggshells are cleaned and sanitized and they do frequent batch testing so there is no need to worry about any contaminants. The makers of Hatched! are concerned about adding supplements that may not be needed by your bird. So they offer this product as a way of allowing your bird to choose to eat it should she feel it is necessary for her.</p><p>Eggs! National Wildlife Refuge System.</p>",716
78,https://www.thesprucepets.com/are-domestic-birds-indigenous-birds-390588,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>Domestic Bird Species</h1>,"<h1>Domestic Bird Species</h1><p>The term ""domestic"" describes any bird that has been bred within the country it resides in. In the United States, domestic birds are birds that are bred and hatched on US soil. They normally have a closed band around their leg to show that they have been domestically bred.</p><p>Although Cockatoos come from Australia, the ones kept as pets in the US are domestic.</p><h2>Domestic Bird </h2><p>The term ""Domestic Bird"" simply means that it was neither wild caught nor bred in another country and imported. Its parents bred in this country and the baby was hatched here. That makes the bird a domestic bird.</p><h2>Indigenous Bird </h2><p>However, thisdoes not imply however they this bird is ""indigenous.""Indigenous simply means that the people plants or species of animals naturally come or occurred in a particular place. Neither Andean Condors norCockatoos originally come from the United States. And yet, according to the definition both could possibly be considered domestic by a strictdefinition of the word.</p><h2>Andean Condors </h2><p>In the summer of 2016, the Cincinnati Zoo had a pair of Andean Condors hatch a baby. It was a big deal at this zoo as well as all over the zoo communityas a chick of this specieshad not been hatched at this Zoo in 30 years. The adult pair, namedGryph and Laurel were spotted with the baby chick. Much was made about this eventbecause it was only the 14th chick to besuccessfully hatched in the past decade.</p><p>Andean Condors are notoriously slow breeders as the offspring stay with their parents for a long time before setting out on their own. This species is found in the Western Hemisphere but itis indigenous to areas of the Andes Mountains in South America. It is the largest flying bird in the world and they typically weigh over thirty pounds with over a 10-foot wingspan. They are indigenous to Bolivia,Argentina, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador.</p><h2>A Catch to Classification </h2><p>While you might consider the baby condor that hatched at the Cincinnati Zooto be considered ""domestic,"" and technically it is, there is a catch to this classification. This is a protected species because it is indeed endangered. Andean Condorsonly have a chick every other year in the wild and it is even more difficult to hatch viable eggs in captivity.</p><p>So while it is protected, the direction this chick is going is still being decided. Due to the fact that these magnificent birds are indeed endangered, there is a breeding program in place.The Association of Zoos & Aquariums'(AZA) has a species survival plan that will determine where the chick will go and for how long.</p><p>In the meantime, she will remain with her parents who are about both about34 years old until it is decided where she will go. She will mostlikely be entered into a breeding program when she is old enough to breed. Andean Condors go into breeding condition rather later as far as birds go. They generally do not begin to breed until they are about six years of age.</p><h2>The Andean Condor Is Endangered </h2><p>The Andean Condor has been classified as ""Endangered"" by the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service so they wantto work with the Cincinnati Zoo to get this bird into a breeding program so they can possibly release any offspring back intothe wild.Andean Condor chicks don't even attempt to leave the nest until they are about 6 months of age as they are slow to develop.</p><p>Many zoos have what are called ""staging sites"" for birds who are destined to be returned to the wild in their natural habitat. A bird must be conditioned to bereleased both through acclimation to weather as well as well as self-feeding for a period of time. They must be able to thermoregulate, meaning that they can control their body temperature. Bird to bereleased back into the wild need to be disease-free and should be able to fly, perch and move naturally.</p><p>While the Zoo's pair of condors has been breeding regularly and while they had one egg a year, they were only successful this year. Experts at the zoo had installed a very big nesting box weighing over three hundred pounds which provided the pair with a dark, cave-like structure in which to breed and care for their egg and care for the baby that they successfully hatched.</p>",709
79,https://www.thesprucepets.com/causes-of-regurgitation-in-birds-390325,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Causes of Regurgitation in Birds</h1>,"<h1>Causes of Regurgitation in Birds</h1><h2>Why Do Pet Birds Throw Up On Their Owners?</h2><p>It's a scenario that is all too familiar for some pet bird ownersyou are sitting with your bird, enjoying spending time together. The two of you are playing, preening, and having fun. Then, all of a sudden, your bird starts bobbing its head rhythmically, and before you know it, it throws up on you.</p><h2>A Behavioral Trait </h2><p>Regurgitation in pet birds can be either a medical problem or a result of a behavioral problem. When it is resulting from a behavioral aspect, it tends to present itself when a bird is exposed to certain types of stimulation. While it can be unpleasant for bird owners to deal with, it's important to recognize the causes of regurgitation and what your bird is really trying to say to you when it is compelled to regurgitate. The points below will help explain what can cause your bird to regurgitate, and why our feathered friends display this somewhat awkward behavior.</p><p>The first thing to understand about behavioral regurgitation is that your bird is demonstrating a sexual behavior towards you. Regurgitation is a courtship behavior- this is a behabvior that indicates your bird is seeing you as a romantic/sexual partner, likely as a result of inappropriate touching or cuddling (ie petting a bird along the back, under the wings, tail, legs, etc. (anywhere but the head), cuddling in a hut/tent, etc). If your bird regurgitates for you, it is attempting to court you which will lead to long-term issues if allowed to continue to happen. When your bird regurgitates for you, you should put them in their cage and not interact with them. This is telling your bird you won't be their mate and to stop these behaviors.</p><p>Secondly, regurgitation can be triggered by certain actions on your behalf. Pay attention to your bird and you will begin to recognize things that seem to trigger regurgitation in your pet. It could be a certain word or phrase you say to your bird, a certain toy that the two of you play with or a game that you enjoy, or even something as simple as a scratch on the back of the head, having the bird on your shoulder, or when they eat foods high in sugar or fat like fruit, certain vegetables, or seeds/nuts. Different birds will have different things that trigger regurgitation, so owners must gauge their interactions with their pets in order to determine what types of stimulation compels their own pet birds to regurgitate.</p><p>Once you begin to recognize the things that stimulate your bird to regurgitate, you can eliminate the triggers. This is not to say that you should refrain from interaction with your birdthis is never the case! Rather, you can find different ways to play and show affection to your pet that tend to not trigger the regurgitation behavior. Scratching and preening the head area is a friendly behavior birds do with each other in flocks in the wild. Be creative, there are ways that you can cut down on your bird's regurgitation without sacrificing valuable bonding time. One option to consider is creating foraging projects for your bird- it's fun to watch them figure out new toys and hidden food!</p><h2>Potential Health Concerns </h2><p>True regurgitation is not vomiting. As stated previously, regurgitation can be a behavioral display or related to an illness. In parrots, the substance that is produced during regurgitation is expelled from the bird's crop, and not the stomach. Because of this, it will normally have a mushy consistency that may appear ""washed out"" and be accompanied by a small amount of liquid. If you become concerned that your bird is vomiting, call your avian vet for an appointment as soon as possible to rule out any medical concerns.</p><p>If you feel like your bird is regurgitating too much despite your best efforts to reduce regurgitation triggers, you should seek the help of a certified parrot behavior specialist.

80,https://www.thesprucepets.com/are-round-cages-bad-for-birds-390341,Birds > Pet Bird Supplies,<h1>Are Round Cages Bad for Birds?</h1>,"<h1>Are Round Cages Bad for Birds?</h1><p>Round cages are not recommended for most bird species for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, round cages are dangerous for the inhabitant. Any animal in a round cage could easily get a toe,beak, tail, or entire foot or ankle caught in the small space where the bars gather at the top of the cage. This is a very real danger in and of itself, and you don't need another reason to reject this type of cage. But there are more reasons than just this danger of the V-shaped construction at the top.</p><h2>Poor Construction </h2><p>Most of the round cages on the market have poor welding and are shoddy in their construction. It is also very uncommon to find a stainless steel cage that is round. Stainless steel is  way to go when purchasing a cage, and they are usually sturdy and of good quality. They last forever, they don't rust, and they are safe for your birds. They are easy to clean and maintain, and if you shop carefully, you can find a design that pleases both you and your bird. Stainless steel is an extremely neutral material that pretty much goes with any color schemes or decor you might have in your home.</p><h2>They Aren't Easy to Clean </h2><p>Round cages are difficult to maintain. Try and get a cleaning cloth into those tight spaces between the bars at the top of the cage. Dust, food particles, and other detritus can get trapped in those small spaces between the bars, and it isn't sanitary for you or your bird. Most square cages are made with a built-in slide-out grate as well as a slide-out substrate grate. Round cages don't come built this way. You usually have to pop the top of the cage off of the bottom grate and cage bottom to clean it, and it is inconvenient and messy.</p><h2>They Aren't Recommended by the Industry </h2><p>Some people think that round cages are detrimental to a parrot's psychological health. The thinking is that birds are very intelligent creatures, and some birds have driven themselves crazy climbing around and around cylindrical cages, and feeling like they're never getting anywhere. They believe that giving a bird an angular cage provides them with reference points to different locations in their territoriesthus helping them feel confident, safe, and secure. They also feel that the best set-up for a cage includes a wall behind the cage so that the bird knows nothing is approaching him from behind. This provides security, safety, and privacy on one side of the cage.</p><h2>They Are Awkward for Companion Birds </h2><p>Another reason to avoid round cages is that they are often awkward living spaces for a bird to inhabit. The shape causes a bird's feathers to be in constant contact with the cage bars, wearing them down and giving the bird a ragged appearance. Most round cages available are not very big, and with pet birds, the bigger, the better.There are octagonal outdoor aviaries in places, but you rarely seeround outdoor enclosures.</p><h2>Accessories Aren't Designed to Fit Them </h2><p>While round cages can often be difficult to maintain and keep clean, there is another reason to avoid them. Because most bird cages are now square or rectangular, it can be hard to find certain accessories that will fit round cages. Cuttlebones on metal clips, millet spray clips, removable food bowl holders, and some toys with double clips are made to fit in square or rectangular cages where the bars are equidistant to each other for the entire length of the bar. A square cage gives you more options to accessorize your cage with perches, toys, platforms, bowls, and all of the other accessories you can get to keep your parrot busy and occupied. These toys and accessories are an important part of your bird's life, and they are necessary.</p><p>For these reasons, it may be easier for both you and your pet to opt for a square or rectangular cage. By doing so, you can provide your companion bird with a comfortable homeand provide yourself with an enclosure that is easy to keep cleanand well stocked with fun accessoriesyour bird loves and needs to keep her happy.</p>",698

While many great bird toys can be found online and in pet shops, paying retail prices for toys can get expensive  particularly if your bird is a heavy chewer and destroys his toys very quickly. To help cut the cost of providing playthings for your pet, check out these common household items that you can turn into cheap bird toys. It will help keep playtime fun, and practically free! Incorporate these items into a bird toy by tying them with hemp twine, or drilling a hole and using plastic chain or quick links to attach to a toy that needs some sprucing up and you have saved yourself some money.</p><h2>Wooden Spools </h2><p>Wooden spools (with the thread removed, of course) make safe and fun playthings for birds of all sizes. Some owners use spools as foot toys that their birds can play with while out of their cages, and some string spools of cotton twine or vegetable tanned leather to hang on their pets' cage bars. If you are feeling extra creative, you can place a wooden spool in a dish of food dye to add a splash of color. As they have the place for a sewing machine spindle already built in, these are some of the easiest toys to string up. Simply thread a plastic chain or some plastic rope through the middle and incorporate into your toy.</p><h2>Poker Chips </h2><p>Birds can have a ball playing with plastic poker chips. They can be strung on a rope to create hanging toys, but I like to use them as foot toys with my birds. They will pick them up, roll them around, throw them in the air and chew on them. Because poker chips can be very thin, you should always supervise your pet when playing with them. Birds that are strong chewers could choke if they bit off a small piece of the chip, so be sure to replace the chips if you notice them becoming worn or ragged. It always pays to inspect both foot toys and hanging toys to ensure there are no sharp edges or small bits of the toy that they could ingest.</p><h2>Paper </h2><p>Paper may seem like a dull choice for a bird toy, but many birds are happy to shred the day away with a fabulous paper plaything. Using plain paper with no dyes on it, you can cut shapes for your bird to shred, weave paper strips in and out of your bird's cage bars, or simply crumple it into a ball and let your pet play away! If your bird seems uninspired, you can always dip paper into colored food dye and let it dry to make your creations more interesting.</p><h2>Popsicle Sticks </h2><p>My birds are never happier than they are when they've got a popsicle stick to chew on. More than just a great plaything, popsicle sticks can be a great way to get your pet to exercise his or her beak and jaw muscles. Make sure that any popsicle sticks that you give your bird have been cleaned and allowed to dry, and remember to remove any sticks that look worn or have broken ends  birds can get splinters, too! These can be bought in bulk at craft stores as well as dollar stores. They are very inexpensive, and your bird can find lots of things to do with them. They seem to take to them right away.</p><h2>Molted Feathers </h2><p>One of the best things for a bird to play with comes free with your pet  molted feathers. Wild birds practice their natural preening behaviors on other members of their flock daily, so it's no surprise that preening toys make up a significant chunk of the bird toy industry. Make your own by saving a few of your bird's molted feathers and tying them together at the end with a piece of cotton twine. Hang the toy in your bird's cage to provide him with a ""friend"" to preen and groom. He'll appreciate your efforts.</p>",691
82,https://www.thesprucepets.com/zebra-finch-breeding-basics-390482,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Small Bird Breeds,<h1>How to Breed Your Own Zebra Finches</h1>,"<h1>How to Breed Your Own Zebra Finches</h1><p>Although many finch species are kept as pets, zebra finches are the most popular among bird owners. These birds are known for their energetic singing, with male finches typically being more vocal than female finches. Male finches also have more dramatic coloring that includes a red beak, orange cheeks, and black-and-white stripes on the throat and breast. Meanwhile, female finches are predominantly gray.</p><p>Zebra finches are generally hands-off birds for humans; however, they are social with other members of their species. It's best to keep them in a large flight cage in pairs or groups. But if you put a male and female finch together, odds are they will breed if they're healthy and comfortable in the environment.</p><h2>Before Breeding </h2><p>If you're interested in breeding zebra finches, first make sure you have the time and means to care for the birds. If you don't plan to keep the offspring, secure homes for the baby birds prior to breeding. Irresponsible breeding has left many animals homeless in shelters and rescues.</p><p>Any zebra finches that you intend to breed should be at least 1 year old and free from any physical abnormalities. Prior to breeding, have a veterinarian check your finches to make sure they are in good overall health and discuss the realities of breeding with them.</p><h2>Nutrition </h2><p>Nutrition is also an important factor to nail down prior to allowing your birds to breed. This ensures that they are as healthy as possible. Zebrafinches generally do well with a staple diet of high-quality finch seed and pellets.</p><p>Supplement their diet with vegetables, fruits, eggs,and other bird-safe fresh foods. Sprouted seeds are also highly nutritious and good for your breeding pair. Opt for organic food whenever possible, as pesticides can be incredibly harmful to a bird's fragile body. And be sure to provide your finches with a good avian calcium supplement to support the hen during the egg-making process.</p><h2>Nesting </h2><p>All zebra finches need a large enclosure in which they can fly and play. After all, because they aren't typically handled, that enclosure is often their only space for exercise. The minimum cage size for a breeding pair is 30 inches long, 18 inches high, and 18 inches wide with bar spacing of a half inch or less. For optimal mental and physical health, it's a good rule of thumb to provide your birds with the largest cage you can fit and afford.</p><p>You can outfit your breeding finches with a small woven nest made specifically for small birds.Or you can offer a traditional wooden nest box that's at least 8 cubic inches. Line the nest box with shredded paper (that doesn't have any ink or dye) or another bird-safe nesting material.</p><h2>Egg-Laying and Incubation Time </h2><p>The average zebra finch can lay up to eight eggs in a single clutch, with the average being between three and six eggs. The hen typically lays an egg each day until the clutch is complete, and she will begin incubating the eggs after she lays the last one.</p><p>Zebra finch eggs begin to hatch within 12 to 15 days after the hen starts sitting on them. As a rule, if an egg hasn't hatched within 20 days, you can consider it infertile. It is best to leave the hen alone during this time and minimize noise and activity in her environment. Stress can cause a hen to neglect the eggs.</p><h2>Hatchling Care and Weaning </h2><p>Because zebra finches are not typically hand-tamed birds, the parents should be allowed to raise their hatchlings undisturbed. (With other species, such as parrots, it is important to handle and hand-feed young birds to begin their socialization process.) Continue to feed the parents their regular quality diet. But make sure to offer foods high in protein, such as eggs, which can help the babies develop.</p><p>The babies are usually weaned between 21 to 28 days old. At this point, you might see the parents chasing them out of the nest to encourage them to find food on their own. They will get their adult plumage between 5 and 6 weeks old, which is around the time you can move them to their own cage.</p>",688

We're speaking, of course, about the charming and captivating Parrotlet. Highly intelligent, affectionate, and undeniably cute, these little birds have been diligently working their way into the homes and hearts of bird lovers around the world.</p><h3>What Is a Parrotlet?</h3><p>A member of the  family, a parrotlet is the smallest species of parrot. There are several different breeds of parrotletsincluding Pacific, Green-Rumped, Mexican, and Spectacled parrotletswhich typically have green feathers and sometimes include mutations like blue and yellow.</p><p>Parrotlets form strong bonds with their owners and make excellent pets when properly raised and tamed. Check out the information below for a few key facts about these adorable birdsyou may decide that you are interested in welcoming a Parrotlet of your own into your family.</p><h2>Some Can Learn to Talk </h2><p>While they are very small birds, some Parrotlets can learn to talk, and some develop rather impressive vocabularies for a bird of their size. While it isn't a guarantee that a Parrotlet will do anything beyond a chirp or screech, it never hurts to try to teach them. A word of caution, howeverthe only way to be sure that you are getting a bird that will talk is to adopt a bird that already knows how to talkso please don't rush out and adopt a Parrotlet expecting it to be a little chatterbox.</p><h2>They Are the Smallest Birds in the Parrot Family </h2><p>That's right; these tiny little birds are indeed parrotsin fact, Parrotlets are the smallest birds in the parrot family, even smaller than Budgies! It might come as a surprise to many, but the Parrotlet's closest relative is actually the large and impressive Amazon Parrot, which may account for many of the behavioral traits these little birds exhibit. They also resemble their larger cousins closely in the looks department, which is why many people affectionately refer to them as ""Pocket Parrots.""</p><h2>They Have a Long Lifespan </h2><p>0</p><p>They might be small birds, but Parrotlets can live for a very long time. On average, a Parrotlet that is well taken care of lives for up to 20 years, but many have lived on even into their 30s. For this reason, it is very important that those who are interested in adopting a Parrotlet be sure that they are willing and able to commit a lot of time to care for them. These are pets that will be around for a very long time if things go well, so their owners should be prepared to care for them for many years.</p><h2>They Have Big Personalities </h2><p>Parrotlets have big personalities and don't let their size get in the way when it comes to playing and interacting with their owners and other birds. Those who keep pet Parrotlets often report that they have feisty, sassy personalities that seem too big for their little bodies. It is important that those who own Parrotlets take thetime to handle them every day and provide them with plenty of ways to entertain themselves. Otherwise, the birds may become bored and resort to destructive behaviors. Proper training from the very beginning will help to shape a Parrotlet into a loving and well-behaved pet.</p><h2>They Are Extremely Active </h2><p>Parrotlets are extremely active birds in the wild, spending countless hours each day flying, foraging for food, and staying clear of predators. In captivity, their owners need to do what they can to give them as much exercise as they would receive if they were wild birds. While this sounds challenging, there are lots of creative ways to give pet birds exercise. In addition, to exercise, Parrotlets need lots of social interaction with their owners to thrive in captivityso those interested in adopting one should make sure that they can devote three to four hours per day to spending time playing with their bird.</p>",648
84,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-hold-a-bird-safely-390778,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>How to Hold a Bird Safely</h1>,"<h1>How to Hold a Bird Safely</h1><p>As with most things, there are right ways and wrong ways to hold a pet bird. Birds are rather fragile creatures both physically and emotionally, and since they are not domesticated, scooping one up into your arms is not quite as simple as it would be with a dog or a cat. However, if you practice the correct techniques, you will find that safely holding your feathered friend can be easier than you might think. Check out the tips below for information that will help both you and your bird enjoy your handling time to the fullest extent.</p><h2>Teach Your Bird to ""Step Up"" </h2><p>The majority of bird owners are not professional bird trainersbut it's still important for them to teach their pets a few basic commands in order for them to remain healthy and happy. The most important of these is the Step-Up Command, an easy to teach ""trick"" that trains a bird to step onto their owners' finger. Teaching this command to your bird will make it much easier for you to remove your pet from its cage, in addition to enabling you to easily move your bird from place to place within your home without the need for frightening episodes of ""catch me if you can.""</p><h2>Never Squeeze, Shake, or Strike Your Bird </h2><p>Because birds are such highly specialized creatures built for flight, they have complex anatomy that makes them quite fragile as compared to other types of pets. When handling your bird, it's important to remember to always be as gentle as possible. Never squeeze your bird or hold it too firmly, even if he or she resists handling. Doing so could break one of your pet's bones, damage his or her internal organs, or worse. If it seems like the only way you can hold your bird is to keep a tight grasp on him, try practicing some bonding techniques that will help your pet enjoy being handled and accept it without fright or hesitation.</p><h2>Use a Towel If Necessary </h2><p>Sometimes it can be difficult to hold onto a bird if you need to conduct a wing or nail trim, so it can be beneficial to both of you to practice toweling in these situations. While toweling your bird all the time is far from ideal, it can help to calm your pet and keep him or her safe during times when it's necessary to restrain your feathered friend. Keep in mind that birds can become overheated rather easily, so make sure that if you do need to towel your bird for any reason, you get it over with as quickly as possible. Toweling a bird can be rather traumatic for some pets, so if you must do it, allow your bird some quiet time alone in his cage afterward so that he can recuperate.</p><h2>Don't Allow Your Bird to Sit on Your Shoulder </h2><p>It's a common practice for bird owners to allow their pets to climb, ride, and sit on their shouldersbut it's a bad idea for several reasons. First of all, allowing your bird to sit on your shoulder gives your feathered friend access to your ears, eyes, and other sensitive parts of your face. Should your bird become frightened or upset while riding on your shoulder, you could very well be subjected to a painful and damaging bite. Eliminate the risk by always holding your bird on your hands or forearms, and making sure that they are at a safe distance from your face.</p><h2>Never Hold a Bird by the Wings, Legs, or Tail </h2><p>Even if your bird has not yet mastered the ""step-up"" command, it is never okay to grab him by the wings, legs, or tail. Not only could doing so frighten your bird and damage his delicate plumage, but it could also cause complications such as broken bones or other trauma. If you must pick up a bird who absolutely refuses to step up, do it safely by gently grasping them in a small towel or with padded gloves that will protect your fingers from bites or scratches.</p>",679

Traditionally used in aromatherapy, these potent oils are sometimes considered to be natural, alternative options to traditional medicineand people are increasingly using them in their homes for a variety of purposes, but is it okay to expose your pet bird to these oils? The short answer is , but it all depends on the oils you use, how you use them and, most importantly, what your vet has to say.</p><h2>Are Essential Oils Safe for Your Bird? </h2><p>Made from highly-concentrated plant substances, essential oils are considered to have an array of health and wellness benefits for humans, and some holistic veterinarians are even incorporating essential oils into their treatments. However, the use of essential oils to combat illnesses and other conditions in animals is relatively newand there hasn't been enough research to determine whether they are truly effective in treating, or even remotely benefitting, our pets.</p><p>Therefore, whether you share your living space with a dog, cat, or bird, there are always precautions that should be taken. For birds, in particular, you'll want to be sure to  consult a veterinarian, as caution should always be taken when using any form of essential oils around your feathered friends.</p><h2>Dangers of Essential Oils for Birds </h2><p>Many essential oils are volatile compounds, and thus can prove potentially toxic to birds at certain concentrationsbecause what's safe for humans isn't necessarily safe for your pets, especially when the oils remain in their original form of 100 percent concentration. The trouble is that many essential oils users rely on diffusers and warmers to release the oils into the air in their homes, which makes it impossible to completely eliminate any risks to your bird or other pets. Birds can be particularly sensitive animals, so bird owners should always use extreme caution when using essential oils. Veterinarians don't have enough studies or evidence on the safeties of using aerolized essential oils around birds, especially when using diffusers and warmers, and the damage it could do to birds can be high which is why most veterinarians advise against it.</p><p>If using essential oils carefully and appropriately, such as being sure to dilute them, never getting them into your bird's eyes and having clear instructions from your vet, you don't necessarily have to completely avoid the oils in your home. Some bird owners might even consider using essential oils for both cage cleaning and air fresheninganyone with a bird knows that caring for these pets can sometimes be a stinky business, and essential oils seem to offer a more natural alternative to commercial chemical cleaners with synthetic fragrances. Rinsing everything you clean with essential oils profusely is a must to ensure that your bird can't accidentally consume it or get the oil on its feathers.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Bird owners should note that there are some essential oils that are never safe for their birds (or most animals in general), such as tea tree oil, as they can prove to be very toxic to small animals. Make sure to get a list of toxic and non-toxic oils from your veterinarian or a specialist to ensure you're not accidentally poisoning your bird.</p><p>While some humans ingest essential oils for their healing properties, it's usually not a good idea to add the oils to your bird's water. The oils might not mix properly and remain too concentratedthis can potentially harm (and even poison) your pet.</p><p>Similarly, while you might apply essential oils to your own skin, you never want to apply essential oils to a bird unless under the strict direction and the advice of your veterinarian (which is likely ). Applying essential oils to your bird's feathers will make the feathers heavy and most likely cause stress to your pet.</p><h2>Safely Exposing Your Bird to Essential Oils </h2><p>You should never expose your bird to essential oils without talking to your veterinarian first. If you are interested in doing this with your bird, please talk to your avian healthcare expert about the ways you can safely do so.</p>",684

And some parrots need more seeds than others. But to keep a bird on an all-seed diet is ultimately going to sacrifice their health.</p><p>Seeds contain fat. This fat is the fuel that provides the energy needed to turn into a plant. Sprouting the seed burns this fat and transforms the seed from one type of fuel into yet another. Once the seed sprouts, the fat is burned off and the life-giving nutrients begin to develop. It has transformed from a seed into a plant and that's where the nutrition begins to develop and the availability of those nutrients can be accessed through ingestion.</p><p>Seeds are also deficient in calcium and vitamins as well as other important minerals and this is something parrots need more of than an all-seed diet can offer. And the available seeds have been genetically altered to produce high quantities, so not only is an all-seed diet not balanced, the quality of these seeds is very low.</p><p>Many veterinarians can spot a bird on an all-seed diet just by looking at them. Their feathers are dull, dry, and brittle.</p><p>The health of your bird is primarily dependent on their diet. Food is a fuel that supplies their system with what it needs to function properly. And an all-seed diet just doesn't cut it in the nutrition department.</p><p>Many health problems are indeed the direct result of nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2>What to Feed Birds </h2><p>So what do you feed your bird other than just seed? Parrots are omnivores. They eat plants, fruits, vegetables, sprouts, and the occasional insect. Offering vegetables is a good start to a healthy diet.</p><p>Vegetables that are deep in color are richer in nutrition than those that are not as vibrant. For instance, purple cabbage was found to be more nutrient-dense than a light green one. The colorful red and orange vegetables are colorful due to two chemicals: carotenoids and polyphenols. These chemicals are antioxidants. Antioxidants fight the renegade free-radicals that can do damage to certain cells in your body harming the immune system. By consuming these antioxidant-rich vegetables, you are boosting the ability of the system to fight off disease.</p><p>Root vegetables such as carrots, sweet potato, yams, turnips, and golden beets are dense in nutrition. They develop in the heart of where they get their nutrition: the earth, so they are valuable to a bird's diet.</p><p>Lots of nutrition is found in the greens of these root vegetables as well. Carrot and beet tops are valuable as well as the green leafy tops to radishes. So don't cut off the tops of those vegetables and throw them away. Offer them to your flock to munch on.</p><p>Nuts are a valuable source of nutrition for your birds, particularly the walnut. Walnuts have been found to have some very powerful ingredients: Omega-3 fatty acids, high amounts of copper, molybdenum, manganese, and biotin as well as some really powerful antioxidants that are highly talented at destroying free radicals. Experts refer to what they do as ""Free Radical Scavenging.""</p><p>Fruits provide good nutrition as well, particularly berries. Blackberries and blueberries are rich in many nutrients. And have you noticed more pomegranates and pomegranate juice available in the stores? There is a reason for that. Researchers have discovered that pomegranates are high in antioxidants, and they have a hand preventing heart disease and cancer. And if you look at their appearance, well, there's that dark, rich color again.</p><h2>What to Look For </h2><p>When considering what to include in your parrot's diet, keep your eye on color as a factor in selecting fruits and vegetables to include in their diet. Try to get healthy grains such as quinoa and other ancient grains into your bird's bowl. Taff, amaranth, farrow, and buckwheat all add to the health of your bird as well as those colorful fruits and vegetables.</p><p>As for seed? Moderation is something you should consider. Do your research on healthy seed and avoid feeding nothing but seeds high in fat. As for an all-seed diet? It simply won't sustain your parrot's health.</p>",681
87,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-pet-bird-behavior-problems-390319,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>Pet Bird Behavior Problems</h1>,"<h1>Pet Bird Behavior Problems</h1><p>Just like children or cats and dogs, parrots and other pet birds sometimes exhibit behavior problems that their caretakers find difficult to manage. While there are a number of ways that birds can misbehave and irritate the people they live with, several behavior issues are more widely reported. Thankfully, most of these problems have rather simple solutions if owners are capable of putting forth a little time and effort. Read on to learn about the five most common behavior problems in pet birds, what your bird means by exhibiting these behaviors, and what you can do to fix them.</p><h2>Biting</h2><p>Biting is one of the most commonly reported behavior problems with pet birds, and it's no surprisebites hurt! Thankfully, it can be easy to correct biting behavior in birds if you can identify the cause. If your bird has been chomping at you, ask yourself a few questions about your pet. Could your bird be frightened of something? Could the biting be hormonal in nature? Is the bird simply trying to play with you? Once you are able to figure out where the behavior stems from, you can take steps to discourage it from starting back up again in the future. For example, birds who bite out of fear can be gradually desensitized to people.</p><h2>Screaming</h2><p>Screaming is another undesirable behavior that many bird owners report as a nuisance. While all healthy birds scream and vocalize at some point throughout the day, problem screaming can result from boredom, depression, or some other type of stress that your bird is experiencing. If you've considered all factors and consulted with an avian veterinarian to rule out any medical problems, you may want to talk to a parrot behavior consultant for help with modifying your bird's behavior if the screaming doesn't begin to calm down on its own.</p><h2>Destructive Behavior</h2><p>Destructive behavior in parrots is often a sign that a bird either has a problem with his or her environmentor isn't receiving enough mental stimulation to keep its mind occupied. Birds are highly intelligent and need lots of attention in order to keep from becoming bored. If your bird shows signs of blatantly destructive behavior, assess how you are spending your time with your pet and take steps to include your bird in your daily activities. Doing so can greatly reduce destructive tendencies in most pet parrots.</p><h2>Territoriality</h2><p>Often, birds who suddenly become territorial are simply experiencing hormonal problems due to the onset of breeding season. However, territoriality can have other triggersand can be a sign that your bird is not as happy and comfortable with you as you might like him to be. To help curb territoriality and related behaviors, try practicing some bonding techniques with your feathered friend. Improving your relationship on a fundamental level can go a long way in terms of resolving behavior problems with your pet. If you find your bonding practices aren't helping things improve after a reasonable amount of time, consider hiring a parrot behavior consultant for help.</p><h2>Feather Plucking</h2><p>Feather plucking can occur in cases where birds are severely depressed and unsettled in their environments. If you notice feather plucking in your pet bird, you should immediately consult with an avian vet to rule out the possibility of diseases such as psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD). If medical causes for your bird's plucking are ruled out, it's imperative to consider the way you are housing, feeding, and interacting with your bird. Keeping your pet in a cage that's too small or too dirty, feeding food lacking nutrients, and not paying enough attention to your bird can all cause your pet to start plucking his or her feathers. Keep your bird healthy and happy by doing all that you can to provide the best care possible.</p>",667

Finding fun ""foot toys"" for your bird to toss around and play with outside of his or her cage can promote good exercise habits as well.</p><p>Whatever toys you choose, make sure to secure as much of a variety as possible and rotate them in and out of use so that your bird doesn't get bored with them too quickly.</p><h2>Play Games With Your Bird </h2><p>Inventing some physically involved games to play with your bird is another great way to get your pet moving and on his or her way to optimum physical health. Does your bird have a favorite toy, such as a small ball, that he likes to play with? If so, try a simple game of fetch to get your feathered friend on his feet.</p><p>Some birds may like to chase things, which can offer a great way to get your pet's heart pumping. Try tying a toy to a string and pulling it around for your bird to try and catch. Just be sure to only allow your bird to play with this toy while you are supervising. Loose strings can be dangerous to pet birds if owners aren't careful.</p><h2>Teach Your Bird Some Fun Tricks </h2><p>A great way to help your bird become more active is to get involved with trick training your pet. Not only can learning tricks provide lots of exercise for your pet, but it can help prevent boredom in birds and offer a wonderful bonding experience as well.</p><p>Start with a few fun and easy bird tricks to build your bird's repertoire and start getting him used to training, and then move on to more advanced commands that will wow your friends and family.</p><h2>Make Time for Out-of-Cage Play</h2><p>Perhaps the single most important thing that you can do to help give your bird more opportunities for exercise is to make sure your bird gets to come out of his or her cage for supervised playtime every day. Birds in the wild can walk around and stretch their wings and legs whenever they need to, but pet birds can feel cramped in a cage, no matter how spacious.</p><p>Allowing your bird to have supervised playtime in a bird-safe area of your home each day will help make sure that all your pet's muscle groups get the exercise that is so vital to their maintenance.</p><h2>Try Dancing </h2><p>If all else fails, most pet bird owners can get their pets to exercise with the help of a little music. Birds are naturals at dancing and seem to just love shaking their tailfeathers to an upbeat tune. Try setting aside a few minutes each day to listen to the radio with your bird, and pay attention to the kinds of music that he or she seems to respond to the most.</p><p>Once you have figured out the type of music that gets your pet moving, you can make a customized playlist for your pet to dance its heart out to. Not only will this offer your pet some much-needed exercise, but it's also pretty entertaining to watch.</p>",658

These birds are highly intelligent and enjoy learning new things. But they do require an attentive caretaker who can spend time handling them every day to keep them tame and prevent them from becoming bored. If you're interested in bringing home one of these birds, first learn about some of the fascinating traits Indian ringneck parakeets possess.</p><h2>Indian Ringneck Parakeets Defy Their 'Difficult' Reputation </h2><p>Indian ringneck parakeets have been kept in captivity for centuries but were regarded as an ""ornamental,"" or hands-off, bird species. Ringnecks still have a reputation of being somewhat nippy and difficult to tame. However, those who have grown to know these birds have found they can make loving pets when hand-fed as babies and properly socialized.</p><p>Ringnecks that are handled every day by their caretakers generally have charming personalities. They love working on new bird tricks, such as waving hello with a foot, with their humans. And they enjoyother mental challenges, including figuring out treat puzzles and learning to mimic sounds.</p><h2>Ringnecks Might Cause Some Trouble During Adolescence </h2><p>While ringnecks overall don't deserve their ""difficult"" reputation, they can be a handful during their adolescence. Like some other bird species, young ringnecksusually those between 4 months and 1 year oldoften go through what's called a ""bluffing"" phase. During this phase, hormonal changes can increase a bird's aggressive tendencies, such as hissing, biting, and general resistance to interaction.</p><p>Some inexperienced owners might make the mistake of avoiding interacting with their bird during this phase, which can make the bird even more antisocial. The key to getting through the bluffing phase is to keep trying to bond with your bird while encouraging good behaviors. And remember that the phase should be over in less than a few months.</p><h2>Ringnecks Are Referred to as Parrots and Parakeets </h2><p>Although identified as a parakeet, Indian ringnecks (like all parakeets) are also parrots. These birds have been labeled as parakeets because of their medium size and long tail featherstrademark features of all parakeets. Still, many people refer to them as Indian ringneck parrots, which is also accurate.</p><p>Despite its medium size, the bird's long parakeet tail causes it to need a larger cage than one might think. However, make sure the bar spacing of a large cage isn't wide enough that the bird can get stuck or escape between bars. In addition, this active species needs lots of space outside of the cage to stretch its wings and play.</p><h2>They Come in a Variety of Colors </h2><p>Wild Indian ringneck parakeets are normally mostly bright green with some blue tail feathers and yellow under their wings. Male ringnecks sport black and rose rings around their necks, as well as black facial markings.</p><p>However, selective breeding programs have given rise to a number of beautiful color mutations within the species. This has led to ringnecks whose dominant color is blue, yellow, or white, among other striking color combinations. In many places, the color-mutated birds have become even more popular than the green ringnecks.</p><h2>Indian Ringneck Parakeets Are Excellent Talkers </h2><p>While it's never a sure thing that your bird will be able to learn to talk, opting to adopt an Indian ringneck parakeet will certainly up your chances. These birds are notorious talkers. In fact, they were once considered sacred in their native environment based on their remarkable ability to mimic human speech. Long ago, religious leaders in India observed the birds repeating prayers that were recited daily in the gardens surrounding their places of worship.</p><p>The clarity of their speech, along with their ability to learn dozens (if not hundreds) of words, still continues to surprise people. Ringneck voices are one of the most charming among companion birds, as they tend to be comically high-pitched. They typically start talking between 8 months and 1 year old and are quick learners, especially if their humans spend quality time talking to them every day.</p>",663

Colorful and entertaining, these birds have been kept as pets for hundreds of years. Unlike many other parrots, macaws typically have signature patches of bare skin on their faces that can range in size and color.</p><h3>What is a macaw bird?</h3><p>Macaws are a popular type of parrot that include 17 different species native to tropical North, Central, and South America. Identifiable by their large, curved beaks and long tail feathers, macaw parrots have vibrant colors and a friendly, extroverted temperament.</p><p>These birds are characters, each having different personalities, likes, and dislikes. Due to their size, macaws can be challenging to care for, but for the right owners, they are loyal companions who are worth the time commitment. Here are a few fun facts about these playful members of the parrot family.</p><h3>7 Things to Know About Owning a Macaw</h3><h2>Macaws Are the Largest Parrots </h2><p>There are more than 400 different types of parrots (in the order Psittaciformes), andmacaws are the largest. Macaws normally weigh between two and four pounds, which is fairly hefty for a bird. The largest of the macaws, the hyacinth macaw, can reach lengths of nearly three and a half feet long from the beak to the tip of the tail. Also, they boast an impressive wingspan of up to 60 inches.</p><h2>There Are Many Macaw Varieties </h2><p>While macaws are widely known as the largest parrots, it is worth noting that there are many different types of macaws that come in a variety of sizes.</p><p>The smallest macaws, known affectionately as mini macaws, sometimes only grow to lengths of 12 inches, about the size of a medium-sized conure or large parakeet. No matter how big or small they are, all macaws (with the exception of the hyacinth macaw) share a few common attributes, the most prominent being the bare rings of skin around their eyes. For many people, this is the most recognizable trait among macaws.</p><h2>Macaws Can Live More Than 80 Years </h2><p>When properly taken care of, some macaw species, such as blue and gold macaws, can live for an average of 60 years, and many have been recorded to live for up to 80 years or even more.</p><p>Those who are interested in adopting a macaw are strongly cautioned to make sure that they are willing to commit enough time to care for their pet. It is not at all uncommon for these birds to outlive their owners, so make the same provisions for their care as you would for any other dependent. Or consider adopting an older macaw to provide it with a forever home!</p><h2>It Is Possible to Breed Hybrid Macaws </h2><p>As many different varieties of macaws as there are naturally, breeders in the pet trade have also been able to make bold and colorful hybrid macaws.</p><p>Examples of hybrid macaws include the Catalina macaw, the harlequin macaw, and the Camelot macaw. While these birds have been extraordinarily popular among pet owners, many oppose the breeding of hybrid macaws, since these birds do not occur naturally in the wild.</p><h2>Some Macaws Are Strong Enough to Crack Coconut Shells </h2><p>Hyacinth macaws have enough strength in their massive beaks to crack a coconut shell.</p><p>Despite their impressive strength, hyacinth macaws are known as the ""gentle giants"" of the macaw world due to their sweet and affectionate dispositions, especially when raised as hand-fed babies.</p><p>Other types of macaws also have powerful and impressive beaks, making them a force to be reckoned with during acts of aggression or bouts of hormonal behavior. This is a major reason why macaws are generally recommended only for those who have experience keeping large parrots.</p><p>And to reiterate, macaws, like all parrots, need social interaction and socialization so they don't grow bored. A bored macaw will vocalize often, perform feather destructive behavior, and will chew on any wood it can find, and with its powerful beaks, this can mean serious destruction.</p>",653
91,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-your-bird-needs-nail-trim-390676,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>5 Signs Your Bird Needs a Nail Trim</h1>,"<h1>5 Signs Your Bird Needs a Nail Trim</h1><p>Many bird owners agree that trimming a bird's nails isn't the easiest task. But it's necessary from time to time to preserve your pet's health and comfort, as well as to maintain your own safety. Some owners opt to take their bird to the vet for a nail trim while others learn to do it themselves at home.</p><p>The frequency with which you'll have to trim your bird's nails varies, depending on its species, health, and what's in its environment to wear down its nails. If you're not sure whether your bird needs a nail trim, there are some key signs to look for that can help you determine when the time is right.</p><h2>Excessive Nail Length </h2><p>One of the most obvious signs that your bird needs a nail trim is excessive nail length. Most bird owners can tell just by looking at their pets' feet when they are due for a trim. However, if you're a new bird owner, it's not always easy to recognize a normal nail versus one that's overgrown.</p><p>Ask your veterinarian to help you become familiar with your bird's anatomy, and take the time to give your bird a regular once-over for anything that's abnormal. This is the best way to judge whether your bird needs a nail trim, as well as to notice whether it's developing any health issues.</p><h2>Changes in Perching Behavior </h2><p>One of the biggest clues that something is amiss with your bird's feet is a change to its normal perching behavior. Have you noticed your bird favoring one foot lately? Or has it recently seemed to prefer standing on the cage floor rather than using its perches? Any sort of change in the way your bird normally perches and carries itself is a cause for concern.</p><p>It might simply be that the bird's nails are too long, making perching uncomfortable. If that's the case, a nail trim should resolve the abnormal behavior fairly quickly. But if your bird doesn't improve, it could be a sign of a foot injury or a potentially serious health issue. So it's best to see your vet as soon as possible if your bird's perching behavior becomes abnormal.</p><h2>Difficulty Getting Around </h2><p>Birds use their feet for practically everything: walking, grasping food, climbing, playing with toys, and holding on to perches. So if their nails aren't kept in good order, many aspects of their lives can be affected.</p><p>If you notice your bird's nails getting stuck on your clothing, in bits of food, or on other surfaces, then it's definitely time for a trim. Nails that are a healthy length should give your bird traction without hindering its efforts to get around.</p><h2>Rough or Scabby Patches on the Bird's Skin </h2><p>If you've been noticing abnormal patches on your bird's skin, such as rough skin or scabs, then a nail trim might be in order. Like many other animals, birds use their nails to scratch and relieve itches all over their bodies. But birds with overgrown nails are prone to accidentally scratching themselves too hard. This sometimes can cause bleeding or abrasions.</p><p>So give your bird's nails a trim if they look a little long and you notice some sore spots on its skin. If its skin doesn't start to look better within a day or two, then you should promptly schedule an appointment with your avian vet. It's also ideal to call your vet as soon as you spot any skin issues to make sure your bird's symptoms don't require immediate attention.</p><h2>Scratches to Your Hands </h2><p>Can you comfortably handle your bird without getting painful scratches all over your hands? If not, then it's likely time to trim those nails.</p><p>While it's normal to be able to feel your bird's nails when it perches on your hand, the nails shouldn't be so long and sharp that you are unable to hold your pet without getting scratched. Opt for a nail trim any time holding your bird starts to become uncomfortable.</p>",659

But why do beaks get flaky? Well, the answers are down to what they're used for and what they're made of.</p><h2>A Bird's Beak Is Their Tool </h2><p>A bird's beak is a tool for the bird, much like your hand or foot. Birds use their beaks in various ways, allowing them a way to grasp objects, to crack open seeds and nuts, tearing or shredding material used for nesting, or enlarging a nest hole. Birds also use their beaks for climbing. So you can see how important a healthy beak is to a bird! It is not only a part of their body, it is an important part of their daily life.</p><p>Various species of birds have adapted to their environment and beaks of various sizes and shapes have occurred naturally in the world depending on the various uses they have for the beak. That's why in the wild, you will see beaks of all typesdepending on what they are used for in their part of the world in order to survive. One of the main factors in how the shape of the beak is formed is determined by what and how they eat. Woodpeckers, for instance, use their beaks to gouge holes in trees locating insects as a part of their diet. Their beak remains sharp and chiseledfor this use by the very action of using their beaks on the wood of trees.</p><h2>Beaks Are Made of Keratin </h2><p>The beak is made up of keratin, the same substance as a fingernail. Just like a fingernail, a bird's beak will continue to grow throughout their lives and need to be worn down. This keratin sometimes becomes flaky which is a normal part of the molting of the outer layers of keratin; this molting allows new keratin to develop as the old keratin is worn off. Occasionally you will see this flaking and scaling of the beak as this renewal process continues.</p><p>In the wild, a bird's normal daily activities will keep their beak worn down to manageable dimensions as it grows. It doesn't get too long or overgrownand the continued growth keeps the beak useful for all of the activities that occur. Companion birds normally will wear down their beaks by chewing on toys of various textures.</p><h2>Does a Cuttlebone Work? </h2><p>A cuttlebone works well for this condition if your bird accepts it. Also, playing with toys and climbing also helps condition their beak as well as the process of moving about the cage and using their beak to assist with this moving about.</p><p>One cause of flaky beaks is a vitamin-A deficiency, an issue that can easily be remedied by making sure your pet is offered a variety of fresh foods and high-quality supplemental pellets.A healthy diet is a good way to ensure that your bird's beak remains healthy and normal. Chop, sprouts, and other fresh vegetables can help.</p><p>At times, however, a beak can get flaky-looking patches on it as well as ""growth"" lines. Much like the human fingernail, a bird's beak grows continuously throughout its life, and the new growth can cause the beak to appear streaky or striped.</p><p>If you think your bird's beak is growing abnormallyif there are abnormal grooves or if pieces of the beak actually flake offthen the best thing to do is contact an avian vet immediately. They will be able to diagnose the problem and help your bird get back on the road to exceptional health.</p><p>To help keep your pet from developing a beak problem, offer your bird plenty of chew toys or cuttlebones to exercise and grind their beaks on. This should go a long way in keeping your bird's beakhealthy, which will, in turn, keep your bird happy and feeling great!</p>",663

Spinach, for example, is full of beneficial omega 3 fatty acids, which help a bird have healthy skin and feathers. Vegetables like these are an important part of balanced nutrition for pet birds than owners sometimes overlook.</p><h2>Melons </h2><p>Melons have been known for years to offer anti-aging qualities to people, and they have many other traits that can benefit your pet bird as well.

Early detection of illness is key to successful treatment in pet birds, so it is crucial to learn about some of the most common illnesses that affect birds in captivity.</p><p>If you notice your bird exhibit any of these signs of illness or other uncharacteristic behavior, seek the attention of a qualified avian vet as soon as possible.</p><h2>Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD) </h2><p>Proventricular Dilatation Disease (PDD) is one of the most confounding avian disorders. The disease affects the nerves that supply the bird's gastrointestinal tract, though it can also affect nerves that supply other organs, too.</p><p>PDD is also known as Macaw Wasting Syndrome and Parrot Wasting Syndrome because it's most commonly diagnosed in Macaws, African grey parrots, Amazon parrots, cockatoos, and conures.</p><p>Symptoms of PDD include weight loss, vomiting, changes in the bird's droppings, and a swollen crop, which is the muscular pouch near the throat. However, no one sign or symptom can distinguish PPD. Some birds may not show any signs of illness until they are very sick with the disease.</p><p>Treatment will often be nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and the bird may have to be put on a special diet. However, there's no cure for the disease, so these treatments are just to reduce pain for the rest of the birds' lives.</p><h2>Psittacosis (Parrot Fever) </h2><p>Psittacosis, or ""Parrot Fever,"" is a form of the Chlamydia bacterium that can affect all hookbills. The disease is highly contagious and can be passed from birds to other animals, as well as humans.</p><p>Symptoms of Psittacosis aren't specific, but they include difficulty in breathing, nasal and eye discharge, inappetence, and loose, watery droppings with general lethargy. Treatment is most often an antibiotic, tetracycline, which can be given orally or through injections. However, birds taking tetracycline cannot have calcium because of its effect on the medication.</p><h2>Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD) </h2><p>PBFD is a serious illness that can affect all members of the parrot family and has been referred to as ""bird AIDS,"" given the similarity between the diseases. Although most affected birds are under the age of two years, PBFD can affect birds of any age.</p><p>Symptoms of PBFD include feather loss, abnormal feather development, the absence of powder down (dander), and growths, lesions, and abnormalities of the beak. If a bird is showing symptoms, the veterinarian may do a skin and/or feather biopsy.</p><p>Currently, there is no treatment for PBFD, so a vet will recommend supportive care that includes pain management.</p><h2>Polyomavirus </h2><p>Polyomavirus is a disorder that affects caged birds, particularly parrots. Birds that are newborn or juveniles are most at risk, and the disease is usually fatal.</p><p>Symptoms of polyomavirus include appetite loss, an enlarged abdomen, paralysis, and diarrhea. Some birds may not show outward symptoms at all, but are carriers of the virus and may shed it in times of stress, posing a risk of infection to other birds in the home.</p><p>There is no known treatment for polyomavirus. This disease can progress quickly and has a high mortality rate. If your bird is at high risk of exposure, aka they are exposed to many other birds, vaccination is available to help reduce the risk of illness.</p><h2>Candida </h2><p>Candida, or Candidiasis, is a fungal infection that can affect the digestive tract of all species of birds. The disease involves an overgrowth of yeasts that are normally found in a bird's digestive system.</p><p>Common symptoms of Candida infections include white lesions in and around the mouth and throat, vomiting, appetite loss, and a crop that is slow to empty. The bird might appear to be lethargic.</p><p>Most Candida infections are successfully treated using antifungal medications. Candida often develops secondary to another disease, so the bird should be examined and treated for all potential problems by a vet.</p>",650

Lillies can cause severe irritation to a bird's mouth, excess salivation, and gastrointestinal signs like vomiting.</p><h2>Mistletoe </h2><p>Another popular holiday plant, mistletoe also can be deadly to pet birds. All parts of the plant can cause mild to moderate gastrointestinal upset, including vomiting, diarrhea, weakness/depression, and anorexia if birds ingest it.</p><h2>Morning Glory </h2><p>The beautiful flowers of this popular vine are pleasant to look at, but it poses a serious threat to your pet bird's health. Be especially careful if you acquire morning glory seeds for planting, as they contain a dangerous chemical similar to LSD.</p><h2>Philodendron </h2><p>Philodendrons are common houseplants whose foliage can add a jungle vibe to the home, but they're not safe for birds. All parts of the plant are toxic and can cause serious irritation to a bird's mouth, difficulty swallowing and breathing, and vomiting, among other symptoms. If large amounts are ingested, it can even lead to coma and death.</p><h2>Poinsettia </h2><p>These beautiful plants are often the centerpiece of holiday festivities. But if you own birds, you might want to opt for a safer decoration. Poinsettias not only are poisonous to birds causing gastrointestinal issues, blistering, excess salivation, skin irritation, and other serious health problems but they can make other pets and people sick, too.</p><p>You might think having a shamrock plant will bring a little luck into your home but not for your bird. These houseplants are highly toxic to birds, along with cats, dogs, and other animals. They can cause tremors and excessive salivation, among other health issues.</p>",623

However, it can be difficult to determine exactly what is ""normal"" when it comes to bird poop. It might seem gross, but analyzing your bird's droppings for color, texture, and other factors can go a long way in keeping your pet healthy.</p><h2>Colors </h2><p>Healthy bird droppings can display an array of colors and still be considered ""normal."" Your bird likely consumes many various types of fresh fruits and vegetables, a multitude of different seeds, and a variety of multi-colored pellets if you supplement your bird's meals with a commercially available diet. The food dyes in these pellets, combined with the natural colors of the fresh foods your bird eats, will naturally produce a rainbow of colors in their droppings.</p><p>However, if you notice that your bird's poop suddenly changes color, it can be a sign of severe health problems that need prompt veterinary attention.</p><h2>Textures </h2><p>The texture of the droppings will also vary based on your bird's diet. However, there are certain things to keep in mind when analyzing your bird's poop to make sure that it's healthy.</p><p>For one thing, the dropping should be neither too wetnor too dry. A good rule of thumb is that the poop should be close to mimicking the consistency of toothpaste, for lack of a less disgusting analogy. Be on the lookout for droppings that are very dark or seem ""tarry,"" as this can be a sign of internal bleeding, which requires immediate veterinary care.</p><h2>Odors </h2><p>In general, your bird's droppings should produce little to no odor. Poop that seems overly smelly can be indicative of infection, intestinal problems, or other types of illness. This is not to say that you should get down and sniff your bird's droppings; that can be harmful to your health. Rather, pay attention when you bird uses the bathroom, and see if there seems to be any noticeable scent wafting around the cage. If your nose detects something that's just not ""right"" about the odor, it's probably a good idea to contact your bird's vet for an evaluation.</p><h2>Presence of Liquids </h2><p>Unlike mammals and other types of animals, a bird's droppings are not normally solid. Rather, there should be a fair amount of liquid present in a healthy bird's waste, as a bird's anatomy does not have a separate mechanism for eliminating liquid waste from their bodies.</p><p>Instead, urine and feces are expelled at the same time. The urine in bird droppings normally presents itself as a white-colored, pasty liquid and usually comprises around 30 to 50 percent of the volume of the droppings. While this can vary slightly without being cause for alarm, you should definitely report to your avian veterinarian if you fear that there is too much or too little liquid in your bird's waste.</p><h2>Size and Amount </h2><p>As one might expect, the volume of a bird's droppings will be relative to the size of the bird producing them. In other words, small birds will produce smaller droppings, and larger birds will produce larger ones. Depending on the diet, slight variations in what is a normal amount of droppings for any given bird are to be expected, but any drastic change in the size or frequency of your bird's poop should be noted and reported to your veterinarian. If you are worried about how often your bird poops, you can add a blueberry to their diet. This addition will turn your bird's poop blue, and you can measure how long from feeding time it takes for a blue poop to result.</p><p>Again, paying attention to your bird's droppings when cleaning out its cage will give you the best idea of what fits inside the normal range for your particular bird.</p>",644
98,https://www.thesprucepets.com/make-your-bird-more-friendly-390315,Birds > Pet Bird Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Train Your Bird to Be More Friendly</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Bird to Be More Friendly</h1><p>A common complaint from owners of pet birds is that their birds are simply not friendly enough for their liking. When this is the case, it is most often a problem on the owner's part rather than the bird's. Luckily, there is plenty that can be done to help you and your bird see eye to eye. Use these tips to find some easy ways that you can convince your bird to be a little more sociable toward you (and the rest of your family). With patience and practice, you'll likely begin to see a real change in the way that your feathered friend chooses to interact with you. The tips don't require a lot of time, but they do require consistency from both you and any other human.</p><h2>Go to the Vet for a Checkup</h2><p>This seems unrelated to the task of helping your anti-social bird become more friendly, but underlying health issues can have a real impact on your bird's personality. Most humans are not on their best behavior when they don't feel good, and birds can be the same way. Taking your bird for a checkup with your avian vet can ensure that there aren't any medical issues standing in the way of building a better relationship with your feathered friend. Once your bird has a clean bill of health, you can start working to make it more friendly.</p><h2>Teach Your Bird a Trick</h2><p>Taking thetime to teach your pet a bird trick, even a simple one, can do a great deal to make you look better in your bird's eyes. Training sessions take time, and spending more time with your bird is essential to the bonding process. Plus, the act of working on something and then finally achieving it together can go far in improving your relationship with a bird. Start with a simple trick such as waving hello, and once you have accomplished that task, move to more complicated tricks.</p><h2>Handle Your Bird Every Day</h2><p>Bird owners need to take thetime to handle their birds every day. Handling your bird requires personal, one-on-one time be spent with your pet, and forces both of you to interact with each other more intimately. If a bird isn't behaving, usually adding more handling time into the bird's schedule is all that it takes to turn things around.</p><h2>Share a Meal With Your Bird</h2><p>The way to many creatures' hearts is through their stomachs and birds are no exception. If you're having trouble interacting with your pet bird, try some good old-fashioned bribery and set up a meal of fresh fruits and veggies to share with your bird. Sharing food is normal and natural behavior among birds in a flock. A meal together is likely to help your bird start seeing you as a family member. Just remember to stay away from any foods that could be poisonous to your feathered friend.</p><h2>Make Sure Your Bird Has Plenty of Toys</h2><p>Birds that are bored and under-stimulated are likely to become despondent and, in some cases, unruly. A bored and depressed bird isn't going to be thrilled about spending time with others. If you are having issues with your bird's behavior, make sure that it has access to plenty of safe and fun bird toys. Once you've stocked your bird's supply with toys, rotate them out of the cage often so that your pet doesn't tire of playing with the same old things. You might be surprised to see how quickly new toys can turn a bird's mood around.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>Don't expect an immediate result. Instant success won't happen, but with consistent behaviors from humans, a clean bill of health, and hard work, you can likely expect your bird to become more friendly, social, happy, and stimulated. Also, once your bird has shown improvement, you'll need to continue your modifications to keep your bird acting friendly and social.</p>",647

Birds are thrilled when they can choose from an array of foods during a meal.</p><p>Fresh leafy greens, root vegetables, and organic fruits are all good examples of quality whole food items you can feed your birds to build and maintain their good health.However, it's important to remember a few guidelines.</p><h2>Check for Toxicity </h2><p>As is true for many pets, many human foods are good for pet birds, when prepared correctly. You can safely and successfully add fresh foods to your bird's diet. Some common ""people foods"" are toxic to pet birds, and should never be offered, not even as an infrequent treat.</p><h3>Warning</h3><h2>Slow Introductions </h2><p>Some pet birds, particularly those that have been accustomed to mainly seed and pellet diets, may not be interested in fresh foods right away. When introducing new foods, offer your bird the regular diet as well, to prevent possible weight loss and subsequent illness.</p><p>If you find that your bird won't try fresh foods at first, don't be discouraged. Pretend to taste a small amount of food in front of your bird (but don't consume since bird food is not FDA approved and people have reported adverse reactions), and be very expressive about how good it is. Once your bird notices how much you enjoy what you're, it will only be a matter of time before it'll be ready to try the first bite.</p><h2>Raw Versus Cooked Food </h2><p>When feeding fresh fruits and vegetables to a bird, always offer them raw. A bird's digestive system is best suited to eating fresh foods in their raw natural state, just as they are in the wild bird's diet.</p><p>Occasionally, some food items are better for your bird when cooked. Cooking makes the nutrients more bioavailable because the vitamins and minerals become more readily absorbed by the body. For instance, slightly cooking a sweet potato makes it more nutritious.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Bearin mind, some foods must always be cooked before serving. Dry beans, for example, should never be served raw. They must be soaked overnight, drained, rinsed under cold water, and then boiled for about 20 minutes. Once the beans are boiled, reduce the heat to a simmer, and let them simmer until soft. This will ensure that the toxins found in raw beans have been removed.Grains such as quinoa and other ancient grains should be cookedand cooled before serving as well. Cool foods to room temperature before serving to any bird.</p><p>If you do choose to feed your bird a cooked dish such as eggs or pasta, for example, make sure to prepare it in cookware that does not have a non-stick coating as these emit chemicals that are also toxic to birds. Stainless steel is the preferred cooking surface, as it won't contaminate the food.</p><h2>Add Herbs and Seasonings </h2><p>Although a little crushed pepper is a welcome addition to a side portion of any bird's food, salt can be harmful. While it is usually best to leave the flavor as nature intended,some birds simply love seasonings such as fresh herbs like cilantro and basil. Other birds are wild about a little fresh parsley in their food. And adding a splash of flavor might just result in excitement at dinner, when they may not initially be interested in a bland dish.</p><p>By keeping these tips in mind, you should be able to safely incorporate a cornucopia of fresh foods into your bird's diet. Your bird will benefit from the array of nutrients, and sharing meals with your pet can be a great bonding exercise as well.</p>",626

Birds are not domesticated and operate with a flock mentality, so forming a bond with your pet is crucial to helping him understand that you are his friend. The strength of the relationship between you and your bird will greatly influence the quality of your pet's life, as well as your ownership experience.</p><p>If you need help bonding with your bird, try these effective ways of helping shy birds warm up to you. They will likely help if you find that your relationship with your pet could use some work.</p><h2>Try Sharing Meals With Your Bird </h2><p>Sharing your food with your bird is a great way to help him see you as part of his flock. In the wild, bonded birds regurgitate food for one another, so sharing a meal can go a long way in helping your bird realize that you mean no harm.</p><p>If you choose to offer your bird a tasty treat from your plate, make sure that the food you are sharing is free of salt and seasonings and is safe for birds to eat. If your bird is hesitant about trying the food, put a bite into his bowl, and eat your portion in front of him. Speak softly and talk about how good the food is.</p><h2>Make Time to Socialize </h2><p>Some birds, particularly those that have been rehomed or rescued, may not have had much exposure to humans during their lifetime. Worse still, some may have had very negative experiences concerning people.</p><p>The best way to deal with problems like these is to desensitize the bird to your presence. If your bird gets nervous every time you come around, slowly start to take 5 to 10 minutes a day to sit near your bird and talk to him.</p><p>Be careful not to make any sudden moves around the bird, and talk in a happy, animated voice. As your bird gets more comfortable around you, you can begin to spend longer periods of time with him.</p><h2>Try Some Grooming Sessions </h2><p>Grooming is the first thing in nature that forms a bond between families. Since the point of bonding with your bird is to get him to accept you as a family member, grooming can be a great way to get the message across if the bird will tolerate handling.</p><p>If the bird allows you to, try gently scratching the back of his head or helping him out with a few pinfeathers. Once your bird begins to trust you more, you may even decide to invest in a shower perch so that your feathered friend can join you in the tub!</p><h2>Let the Music Move You </h2><p>Wild birds have two main forms of communication: their voices and body language. As bird owners, we can use this knowledge to help ourselves bond more closely with our captive pets.</p><p>If it seems like your bird doesn't view you as much of a friend, then try singing some of your favorite songs to your pet and dancing around. It sounds a bit silly, but most birds can't resist joining in the fun. You may even want to play some of these popular songs about birds to help set the mood.</p><h2>Try Some Good Old Fashioned Bribery </h2><p>One way to entice shy birds out of the cage to play is to bribe them. Try making up a batch of homemade bird toys and place some in your pet's cage for him to enjoy. Make notes of the ones that seem to be his favorites, and then try ""decorating"" your shirt with them while standing near an open cage door. This may help your bird see how much fun you can be, and is sometimes an offer that even very timid birds can't refuse.</p>",637
101,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bird-beak-health-390427,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Bird Beak Health</h1>,"<h1>Bird Beak Health</h1><p>Even though the quality of a bird's beak is key to the health of the overall bird, it can be difficult for bird owners to assess the health of their bird's mouth, and even more difficult for them to figure out how to treat beak problems if any should arise.</p><p>It's important to know common beak problems that arise in parrots and other types of captive pet birds, look at ways that you can promote and maintain optimal beak health in our feathered friends, and learn how to identify and fix beak problems that can lead to big health issues for our birds. Becoming more aware of the condition of your bird's beak will allow you to formulate a more accurate estimation of his or her overall health, and make it easier for you to provide the best possible care for your beloved pet.</p><h2>Common Beak Problems</h2><p>Although it might not be something you'd normally think about, a pet bird's beak is susceptible to several common problems. Common beak problems, and thankfully, the least problematic and severe, is to notice a flaky beak on a captive exotic bird. For some reason, this seems to be more common in Conures and Cockatoos, although it can happen in any parrot species.</p><p>If you do notice that your pet bird has a flaky beak, the most likely culprit is a vitamin deficiency. In this case, you should consult with your avian vet for suggestions for supplements or dietary changes that will help heal your pet's mouth. Other common beak disorders noted in pet birds are known as scissors beak and parrot beak, both growth abnormalities that can only be corrected with prosthetics or surgery administered by a qualified avian veterinarian.</p><h2>Maintain a Healthy and Strong Beak</h2><p>Helping your pet bird maintain a healthy and strong beak isn't as hard as it might seem. For one thing, providing your bird with bird-safe natural wood perches will help encourage your feathered friend to exercise his or her beak by chewing them, which they would normally do to tree branches in the wild. Another thing that you can do to promote beak health is to provide your pet with plenty of fresh whole foods such as un-shelled nuts. Whole nuts such as Brazil nuts, pecans, walnuts, and almonds all have tough shells and tasty centers that will encourage birds to use their beaks to break into them. Be sure not to overdo it on the nuts thoughtoo much of a good thing can cause weight gain and obesity in your pet.</p><p>Another option for helping your bird maintain a healthy beak is to provide a cuttlebone in his or her cage. Not only to do birds find cuttlebones to be fun playthings to chew on, but the cuttlebone also helps to provide a healthy boost to a bird's calcium intake. This can be especially helpful for hens of reproductive age, as extra calcium can help prevent egg binding and other problems with egg production.</p><h2>A Beak Trim May Be in Order</h2><p>In some cases of beak overgrowth or other beak growth abnormalities, a beak trim may be in order for your feathered friend. Because a bird's beak is made of keratin and continues to grow throughout the bird's life (much like human hair and fingernails) these trims may be necessary from time to time in cases where the bird fails to properly file its beak on perches, cuttlebones, or toys.</p><p>If you suspect that your bird needs a beak trim, then you should schedule an appointment with your avian vet as soon as possible for an evaluation. Abnormally shaped or overgrown beaks can lead to problems with a bird's ability to eat, which can quickly become very severe. Keep a close eye on your bird's food intake until you can get to the vet's office if you notice that your bird's beak looks odd in any way.</p>",643

If you have one of these species, you might feel eager to teach it to talk but not know how to get started. Follow our guide to learning how to teach your bird to vocalize and pick up words.</p><h2>Get to Know Your Bird</h2><p>The first step to teaching your bird to talk is to bond with your feathered friendand form reasonable expectations of it.</p><p>Not all bird species can talk, and even those that have the ability sometimes choose not to use it. To determine if your bird is a good candidate for speech training, do a bit of research on your pet's species. Some birds are known to be better talkers than others, so you shouldn't expect your pet to say more than it is capable of. </p><h2>Choose Your Words Wisely</h2><p>The best way to encourage birds to speak is to choose a few short words for them to start off with. Examples of good starter words include ""hello,"" ""bye-bye,"" ""nite-nite,"" or even your bird's own name. Simple words, when said with enthusiasm, seem to become more interesting to most parrots. Make sure that when you speak to your bird, you do so in a happy, positive tone. Watch your bird as you repeat the words you've chosen. If you pay close attention, you will probably see that some words will catch its attention more than others. Use the word that your bird responds to the most for your first ""training word."" </p><h2>Repeat the Word or Phrase as Often as Possible </h2><p>Once you have locked onto a word that your feathered friend is interested in, repeat the word to it as often as you possibly can. Parrots learn to mimic through repetitionso saying the word over and over again is the only way to encourage your bird to say it back. While it's always best for owners to teach their pets directly, some owners opt to use extra learning tools such as tape recorders and CDs to help teach their birds to talk. Using these tools can be effective, and certainly won't hinder the training process, but owners should know that they are no substitute for one-on-oneinteraction, and should be used only as supplemental training aids. </p><h2>Have Patience and Don't Get Discouraged</h2><p>The fastest way to encourage a bird to talk is to set up a training routine and work with it every day. Even this method, however, is not entirely guaranteed to work. While some birds pick up on human speech quite readily, some birds take months or even years to say their first word. Some will never talk at alleven owners that work with their pets diligently sometimes end up with a bird that won't say a word. If you feel like your bird is taking too long with his speech training, try teaching something a little bit easier, such as whistling. Many birds find whistling much easier than mimicking speech, and some may be more willing to give it a try for this reason. With love, patience, and plenty of practice and training time, most birds that are members of the parrot family will learn to mimic .</p><p>Pay attention to the vocalizations that your bird makes during the day. You may be surprised to find that you recognize some of them as environmental sounds that you hear every day in your home, like telephones, microwave buzzers, and doorbells. Even if your bird never speaks a human word, you shouldn't feel slighted. Speech training, interaction, and socialization all help to strengthen the bond between you and your pet, so if your bird remains silent, you can still be assured that you'll get a loveable, intelligent, and interesting companion out of the dealand as far as owning a bird goes, that's the best part! </p>",637

However, these little beauties are among the most popular and widely kept types of pet birds in the world, so it's safe to say that many prefer them to larger bird species such as parrots and parakeets. If you'd like to learn more about these little birds, then take a look at the information listed below. You might just learn something about finches that you didn't know before!</p><h2>Finches Are Softbills, Maybe </h2><p>All parrots are classified as hookbills, so it would make sense to classify finches as softbillsat least, to some people it would! Calling finches soft-billed birds is a controversial subject among many who are deeply involved in aviculture. Many contend that since finches subsist on mainly seed, instead of insects and nectar, they should all be labeled as waxbills or hardbills. Still, others assert that since they are not hookbills, they are automatically softbills. This debate has been going on for many years, and for now, there doesn't seem to be an end in sight.</p><h2>Finches Are Very Social Birds </h2><p>All captive pet birds need some form of socialization to thrive in human homes, and for many species, that comes with forming a special bond with their human caretakers. Finches, however, prefer to do things a little bit differently. While there are exceptions to the rule, in general, finches largely prefer the company of other finches to that of a human companion. For this reason, it is normally recommended that they are kept in pairs or small flocks, as opposed to being kept singly. Birds who are kept alone with no means of companionship often become unhealthy and mentally and emotionally unstable.</p><h2>Finches Generally Don't Like to Be Handled </h2><p>Unlike parrots, who should be handled every day, finches tend to not do very well with human handling. While there are always exceptions, it is generally recommended that those who keep finches touch them as little as possible, to avoid frightening the birds and causing them stress. While it is common for finches to become accustomed to observing their human housemates from a distance, most of them never quite get comfortable enough to perch on a person's finger or be willingly handled in any way. For your finch's health, keep handling limited to what is necessary for the bird's health and medical care.</p><h2>Finches Are Among the Smallest Commonly Kept Pet Bird Specie </h2><p>While there are many different types of small birds that are commonly kept as pets, finches are among the smallest of them all! Most finch species are less than 4 inches in length from the beak to the end of the tailfeathers and may weigh less than 1 ounce. Many would think that this should make them the perfect bird for small, cozy homes, but in actuality, a small flock of finches may require an even bigger cage than some types of parrots. This is because finches must be able to fly, so they need a spacious enclosure or flight cage that can allow them to soar and exercise their wings.</p><h2>Finches Are Very Quiet </h2><p>While finches vocalize as much or more as other types of commonly kept pet birds, they have tiny voices that do not carry as far as those of larger birds, such as parrots. For this reason, finches are a great choice for bird lovers who live in apartments or condominiums. The pleasant chips of a small finch flock can often not be heard outside of the room that the birds are housed in, but many who own finches claim that their soft vocalizations are quite soothing, and choose to spend as much time in the same room with their birds as possible.</p>",630

Handling a bird, for example, is a lot different from handling a domesticated animal, and if it's not done correctly, it can be dangerous for both the bird and its owner.</p><p>If you are new to keeping pet birds, then don't miss the information on safe handling below. Taking the time to make sure that you handle your bird safely and correctly can go a long way in making sure that both you and your bird stay safe and enjoy a long and satisfying relationship together.</p><h2>Never Squeeze a Pet Bird </h2><p>While it is sometimes necessary to hold a bird firmly if you need to trim its nails, clip its wings, or perform another type of necessary procedure, it is important to remember that it is never okay to squeeze a bird.</p><p>Birds have fragile skeletons and delicate respiratory systems. Squeezing them too much can cause broken bones, organ damage, and any other number of problems that can lead to severe injury or a bird's sudden death. Keep your bird safe by never putting too much pressure on any part of its body.</p><h2>Teach Your Bird to ""Step Up"" </h2><p>Teaching your bird to step up can go a long way toward helping you handle your bird safely. Birds who refuse to step onto their owners' fingers often have to be toweled or grabbed when it's time for them to come out of the cage, putting them at risk for injury and severe stress.</p><p>If your bird doesn't know the step up command, then you should start teaching him to perform this function as soon as possible. Any bird owner will tell you that it is the single most important thing that you can teach your feathered friend.</p><h2>Don't Allow a Parrot to Sit on Your Shoulder </h2><p>Although movies and TV shows often show parrots perching happily on their owners' shoulders, there are several reasons why this is not a good idea. For one thing, even the tamest and friendliest birds are capable of biting if they become startled or otherwise upset.</p><p>Allowing a bird to sit on your shoulder puts them directly at face level with you, and puts you in great danger of sustaining a horrendous bite if something should go wrong. Prevent this sort of accident by holding your bird on your hand or forearm at a safe distance from your face and ears.</p><h2>Keep Your Bird's Wings Clipped </h2><p>Although it may not seem like it at first, clipping your bird's wings can help a great deal when it comes to handling your bird safely. Birds who have clipped wings quickly learn that they aren't capable of flight, so they will often become more dependent on their owners, sticking to them like glue when they are out of the cage.</p><p>Birds who are not clipped may be prone to trying to take flight when they are being held, leading owners to grab at them out of instinct. Since birds are so physically fragile, this can cause severe injuries. Clipping your bird's wings will help minimize such a risk.</p><h2>Guard Your Jewelry and Accessories </h2><p>A final thing to keep in mind when learning to hold a bird safely is that birds love to bite and pick at small, shiny objectsso your rings, earrings, necklaces, and other jewelry will be pretty much irresistible to them.</p><p>More than one unfortunate bird owner can attest to what can happen if your feathered friend decides to go for an earring or another type of piercing. Play it safe by removing all jewelry before handling your pet bird, and keep a couple of safe bird toys on hand to keep your pet distracted.</p>",630

Pet birds also often have complex diet requirements, and consequently many experience health issues due to nutrient deficiencies. One of the most common questions pet bird owners have is whether they should choose seeds or pellets as the base of their birds' diet. But the answer isn't so simple.</p><h2>A Seed Diet </h2><p>Many pet birds will take happily to an all-seed diet, but that doesn't mean it's good for them. Seeds can be deficient in many important vitamins and minerals while being high in fat. Also, the quality of pet bird seed is often very low. Many seed mixes lack variety, have artificial colors, and contain other unhealthy ingredients.</p><p>Malnutrition linked to an all-seed diet is a top cause of companion bird mortality, along with many other health problems. That's not to say seeds can't be a part of your bird's diet. Seeds can be great treats for a bird. But they must be balanced with other components of a healthy diet.</p><h2>A Pellet Diet </h2><p>A formulated pellet is often the recommended base for a pet bird's diet, in addition to fruits and vegetables. That's because these pellets are created to be a balanced, nutritionally complete food.</p><h3>What is a Bird Pellet?</h3><p>Bird pellets are a type of bird food that contain important nutrients mixed together and packed into small pellets for your bird to eat. Contrary to a strictly-seed diet, high-quality bird pellets have balanced fat content, vitamins, and minerals to keep your bird healthy.</p><p>Not all pellets are created equally. Like seed mixes, many pellet varieties have artificial colors and other ingredients that don't add nutritional value. So it's important to find a pellet with a quality ingredient list.</p><p>Moreover, many birds dislike eating pellets, and it can be especially difficult to convert a bird from eating seeds to pellets. Some birds will even dangerously starve themselves instead of eating pellets, and many don't even recognize the pellets as food. If you're considering a switch from seed to pellets, ask your veterinarian for tips. It's typically a process that occurs over time, rather than overnight.</p><h2>What to Feed Pet Birds </h2><p>Ultimately you and your veterinarian should determine your bird's individual dietary needs. For many birds, the diet will involve an assortment of foods that potentially includes both seeds and pellets.</p><p>In addition to seeds and pellets, leafy greens, many other vegetables, some fruit, grains, and nuts are typically part of a healthy avian diet. For many people, incorporating variety might sound difficult and time-consuming. But you can make feeding easier by learning to prepare chopi.e., meal planning for birds. ""Chop"" simply refers to a mix of fresh, nutritious foods for your bird that you make in a big batch and freeze in meal-size portions. That way, you don't have to worry about washing and cutting produce every day.</p><p>In addition, you also can learn to make a grain bake for your bird. This is essentially a casserole that includes a combination of grains, seeds, vegetables, and fruits that you mix together and bake. Then, just like with chop, cut the bake into meal-size portions before freezing them for freshness. Ask your vet for a healthy recipe that's appropriate for your bird.</p><p>Furthermore, learn how to sprout seeds for your bird to maximize their health benefits. The process of sprouting burns off fat in a seed, which is what damages the health of many birds. Once the fat is diminished, the seed is simply a little powerhouse of nutrients.</p><p>The saying ""You are what you eat!"" applies to birds, too. And a nutritious, varied diet will help to give your companion bird as many healthy years as possible.</p>",632

This behavior comes naturally to many of our feathered friends, with highly intelligent birds such as cockatiels and parrots among the easiest to train.</p><p>Not only will teaching your bird to dance be entertaining, but it will also offer your pet some extra exercise and mental stimulation, both of which can improve its overall health.</p><h2>Choose an Appropriate Training Space </h2><p>Before you begin to teach your bird any sort of trick, it's important to take the time to choose the best area of your home to use as a training space. Birds can respond differently to training depending on their level of comfort with their surroundings, so it pays to select an area that your bird will view as non-threatening and safe.</p><p>Quiet, non-cluttered rooms generally make the best choices, preferably away from the majority of household foot traffic. Eliminating as many distractions as possible will help keep your bird on track during your training sessions.</p><h2>Select Upbeat Music </h2><p>By nature, birds are geared to respond to sound, so it's no wonder that so many seem to enjoy hearing various types of music. When teaching your bird how to dance, try to choose a fun, upbeat tune to train your bird with. Rhythmic songs with medium to fast tempos tend to encourage most parrots to get moving quickly.</p><p>Don't be discouraged if your bird doesn't seem to appreciate your musical choices, just keep trying different types of music until you find something that your bird seems to respond to.</p><h2>Set an Example for Your Bird </h2><p>It sounds like a silly idea, but sometimes birds learn best when they are given an example. If your bird doesn't seem to be getting the hang of dancing on his or her own, it may be necessary for you to step in and give your pet a demonstration. Turn the music up and dance around to show your bird how fun it can be. Many times this will excite parrots to the point that they will start dancing along with you before they even realize what they're doing.</p><h2>Use Visual Props </h2><p>If your bird still doesn't dance despite your best demonstrations and other efforts, then you may consider showing your pet some videos of other birds ""cutting a rug."" Make a playlist of your favorite dancing bird videos to share with your pet. Birds generally love watching other birds, and usually, they will emulate what they see. This can be one of the quickest ways of encouraging your bird to dance or perform an array of other tricks and behaviors.</p><h2>Reward Progress </h2><p>As with all training exercises, it's important to reward your pet for any progress it makes toward learning the behavior that you're trying to teach. Even if your bird isn't a full-blown dancing machine after the first few training sessions, rewarding progress in increments is key to helping your pet understand the behavior that you want them to learn.</p><p>Keep some tasty bird treats on hand while training to make sure that your bird stays engaged and interested in what you are doing. Using treats to keep training sessions fun will help your bird learn more quickly and easily over time.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior </h2><p>Since dancing is a behavior that comes naturally to most pet birds, it's a little different than teaching a behavior like singing or talking. If you're having difficulty getting your bird to dance on cue, keep trying different kinds of music. Try leaving the music on when you're not around (at a reasonable volume, of course) so the bird doesn't feel any performance anxiety. Most birds will figure out how to get their groove on with some patient encouragement from you.</p>",623

Even the most subtle symptoms can be ""red flags"" that their pet is in dire need of veterinary treatment. Because illnesses can be such a serious issue for pet birds, it is important to become familiar with the most troublesome health problems that can arise in our feathered friends. Take a look at the bird health problems outlined below to learn more about some of the biggest bird health problems that could possibly affect your pet. Increasing your knowledge of bird health problems will help you to recognize any issues early on, and offer your bird prompt treatment and the chance for a swift recovery.</p><h2>Avian Flu</h2><p>Several years ago, cases of avian flu made the news around the world, and recently they have again been popping up in the headlines. While most of the cases focused on involve birds that are raised as food, pet bird owners should know that avian flu can affect birds of any speciesmeaning that parrots and other commonly kept pet birds are also at risk of contracting it if exposed. While the risk of exposure to captive pets is considered minimal, there are things that can be done to further protect your feathered friend from this deadly pathogen.</p><h2>Parasites </h2><p>Parasites can affect any animal, including birds and humans. It is important to monitor your pet bird for any signs of internal or external parasite infestations as children, other pets, and other family members can also contract them if exposed. Certain parasites can be deadly to pet birds if not treated quickly, so learning as much as you can about their signs, symptoms, and risks of exposure is imperative to protecting your pet and family.</p><h2>Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease (PBFD)</h2><p>One health problem that strikes fear into the hearts of bird owners is Psittacine Beak and Feather Disease, also known as ""PBFD."" It is a deadly virus that causes abnormal beak and feather growth, lesions, and various other problems. PBFD can affect any parrot species, and there is currently no known treatment or cure. To make matters worse, PBFD is highly contagious, and can quickly spread throughout an entire flock of birds who are kept in close quarters. It is important to learn about the signs of PBFD in order to prevent the spread of this devastating illness to other birds that may be owned by you or your friends and family.</p><h2>Egg Binding</h2><p>Those who own male birds can breathe easy hereegg binding is a condition that can only affect female birds of breeding age. Egg binding is a very serious problem and can cause death in affected birds if it is not promptly treated by an experienced avian vet, so it is important for those who own female birds to become familiar with the signs and symptoms of egg binding so that they can recognize any problems early enough to save their pets.</p><h2>Stress</h2><p>Pretty much every adult alive knows what stress is, but many don't realize that stress can also affect parrots and other pet birds, and just as it does in humans, it can cause a decline in immune response and make a bird more susceptible to other illnesses. While they are subtle, there are several different signs that bird owners can watch for so that they can identify stress in their birds and prevent the onset of more serious issues. It's important to learn about what can cause stress in your feathered friend and what you can do to reverse it if it has become a problem.</p>",612

To say that these birds are intelligent would be an understatement, and the best part is, that's not the only thing that makes the African Grey parrot so special. Read on to discover a few of the most interesting and exciting facts about African Grey parrots, including their origin, information on the various subspecies of African Grey, and more. Learning more about these incredible birds may inspire you to get involved with the species in a larger capacity, be it through adoption, research, or conservation.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Intelligent African Grey Parrot</h3><h2>There Is More Than One Type</h2><h2>They're Among the Most Intelligent Bird Species</h2><p>Besides being one of the most popular pet bird species, African grey parrots are also one of the most intelligent. In recent years, much research has been done on the mental capacity of African grey parrots by scientists around the world. The most famous instance of this is the work that Dr. Irene Pepperberg conducted with her famous African grey, Alex. Using Alex and other African greys in research trials focusing on communication, she was able to show that not only can African grey parrots learn an incredible amount of human words, they can learn to use them in context to communicate with their owners. It has been said that these impressive birds have the mental and emotional capacities of a 5-year-old human child.</p><h2>Caring for an African Grey Can Be Hard Work </h2><p>Because they are so intelligent, African grey parrots form very strong bonds with their ownersand can be quite emotionally needy. Due to this trait, they do best with owners who can devote ample time to handling and socializing with them daily. Also, African grey parrots need a lot of exercise to keep their strong muscles toned and maintain an adequate physical condition. This means that they must be able to spend several hours per day outside of their cages, playing in supervised, ""parrot proof"" areas.</p><h2>They Can Live for a Very Long Time</h2><p>African grey parrots have been known to live for up to 80 years in captivity, so it's imperative that those who adopt them can commit to a lifetime of living with a bird. African grey parrots are too emotionally sensitive to be able to handle being bounced from owner to owner, but sadly many of them do have several homes throughout their lifetimes because people rush into adopting them without fully thinking it through. You can help put an end to situations like these by helping to educate people about African grey ownership, and by making sure that you set a good example for bird owners who might be interested in adopting such a parrot.</p><h2>They're Hard to Keep Occupied </h2><p>Most people can relate to the difficulties of keeping a young child occupied, so it's not a stretch to say that keeping a highly intelligent bird from getting bored can be similar. African grey parrots need plenty of mental stimulation to stay happy and healthy, so they must be provided with avariety of toys and other ways to exercise their minds. Otherwise, they can resort to destructive behavior and develop unpleasant habits that might require professional intervention.</p>",611
109,https://www.thesprucepets.com/converting-bird-from-eating-seeds-to-pellets-1236726,Birds > Pet Bird Nutrition & Food,<h1>Converting Your Bird from Eating Seeds to Pellets</h1>,"<h1>Converting Your Bird from Eating Seeds to Pellets</h1><p>An all-seed diet is poorly balanced and unhealthy for most types of pet birds, especially parrot species. They will often pick out what they want and not eat the rest. Formulated diets are increasingly available and are now being designed for specific species. Ideally, this should make up part (but not all) of the diet for most pet birds.</p><p>Technically, the term ""formulated diets"" is more accurate than the term ""pellets,"" since these diets are available in many forms, including pellets, crumbles, nuggets, and more. Many birds are less than enthusiastic about switching to pellets, but with patience and persistence, almost any bird will eventually accept a formulated diet. The transition to pellets may take a few weeks or a few months, and some or all of the following strategies may be used.</p><h2>Health and Safety </h2><p>Most importantly, never try to starve your bird into eating pellets; this could be dangerous to your bird and very stressful. If at all possible, you should monitor your bird's body weight throughout the conversion period to make sure weight loss is not occurring. Avoid converting a sick bird. Only try this if your bird is healthy. Carefully monitor the number of droppings and the bird's body weight. If the number of droppings is diminishing and the bird's body weight goes down by more than 10 percent in a week, back off on the new foods and offer more of the old diet.</p><h2>Easing the Transition </h2><p>If you are raising a young bird, start it on pellets as soon as possible. Younger birds are usually much more willing to try new foods than older birds who may be ""set in their ways."" If your bird is not used to a variety of foods, you might want to work on introducing some new vegetables and other foods before introducing pellets. Getting your bird used to new flavors and textures may help the transition to a formulated diet. It is possible to introduce other new foods along with pellets, but avoid overwhelming a bird with too many new things at one time.</p><h3>Tips</h3><h2>Determining How Much Food </h2><p>Measure how much your bird eats in a whole day (amount given minus the amount left at the end of 24 hours). Add up the amounts eaten every day for seven days, then divide by seven to get the average daily intake. This daily average determines the total amount of seeds and pellets (combined) to feed each day. During the switch, you will gradually reduce the amount of seed fed, and make up the average daily intake with pellets.</p><h2>Schedule for the Transition </h2><p>For pickier birds, the switch may need to be much more gradual.</p><h2>Success Is Possible </h2><p>For smaller parrots such as budgies and cockatiels, once you achieve a diet that is just 25 percent seeds (25 percent seed, 50 percent pellets, and 25 percent fresh foods) you have succeeded! For larger parrots, continue to decrease the seeds a bit more so that the diet is only about 10 percent seeds overall (with about 5060 percent pellets and the rest made up of fresh foods and treats).</p><p>Making the switch may be difficult, discouraging, and time-consuming (not to mention the wasted pellets until your bird accepts them). Just remember, your effort is worth it and you will be rewarded with a healthy bird on a well-balanced and nutritious diet.</p>",564
110,https://www.thesprucepets.com/clipping-bird-wings-390671,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>Clipping a Bird's Wings</h1>,"<h1>Clipping a Bird's Wings</h1><p>Wing clipping could be labeled one of the most controversial subjects in aviculture. There are many reasons why some bird owners choose to clip their bird's wings and just as many reasons why some bird owners do not.</p><p>While wing clipping is controversial, the decision to trim a bird, or not, is one best left to the individual owner.</p><h2>The Pros of Clipping </h2><p>The primary reason to clip your bird's wings is to ensure that it doesn't fly away. By trimming the bird's primary feathers, known as ""flight feathers,"" they cannot take flight. This prevents them from accidentally flying out an open door or window, which can be dangerous for a domesticated bird.</p><p>Safety inside the home is another big reason why most bird owners choose to clip their pets. Indoor life poses perils that birds do not normally face in the wild. These include things such as windows, ceiling fans, ovens, doorways, sinks, and toilets. Clipping a bird's wings can help limit their access to these dangers.</p><p>Clipping a pet bird's wings also forces the bird to be more dependent on its owner. Many people believe that this can serve to enhance the bond between a bird and its human. However, this can ingrain learned helplessness and owners should be aware of their birds body language when interacting with them, especially since they can't fly away. Also there are countless flighted pet birds that enjoy close relationships with their human families.</p><h2>The Cons of Clipping </h2><p>Those on the other side of the fence contend that depriving a bird of its ability to fly can cause physical and psychological damage. Many people argue that the benefits of flyingexercise and mental stimulationfar outweigh the risks of injury to a pet bird, provided they are properly supervised.</p><p>Others have different reasons for not trimming their birds. Show birds, for example, have the best chance of winning when they are fully feathered. Some people also feel that since birds were intended to fly, clipping takes away their freedom and primary source of natural movement.</p><p>Additionally, clipping may not be a good choice for every bird or household. A bird can become overweight if it's not allowed the proper amount of exercise offered by flying which can contribute to heart disease. You'll also want to think about your other pets. Cats and dogs may view the bird as prey, in which case you'll want your bird to use its natural defense mechanism of flight to escape harm. Most bird owners want to mimic their species natural environment and in the wild, birds spend countless hours searching and foraging for food by flying around.</p><h2>The Decision Is Yours </h2><p>Putting some thought into the reasons for and against wing clipping will help you make the best choice for your pet. Talk to your avian veterinarian to get his or her input and be sure to discuss the options with your family members. With careful consideration, you are sure to make a decision that will satisfy the needs of both you and your favorite feathered friend.</p><p>If you do decide to clip your bird's wings, be sure to learn as much about the process as possible. Take your bird or a local store/groomer to get their wings clipped and learn by watching on how to do it if you wish to do clipping at home. Be sure to follow the steps to safely clip the wings and make a good decision about which clipping style is right for your bird. Not every method is right for every bird breed.</p>",602
111,https://www.thesprucepets.com/regurgitation-in-pet-birds-390308,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>What to Do if Your Pet Bird Is Vomiting or Regurgitating</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Pet Bird Is Vomiting or Regurgitating</h1><h2>Regurgitating Is Natural Bird Behavior; Vomiting Is Not</h2><p>Regurgitation, perhaps one of the most perplexing bird behaviors, occurs when a bird throws up small amounts of food with the intention of feeding it to a loved one. Regurgitation is perfectly normal behavior in birds, and not a reason for concern. Vomiting, however, is a sign of illness that should be addressed immediately.</p><h2>Why Do Birds Regurgitate? </h2><p>Regurgitation is a natural behavior related to bird parenting. In most cases, a regurgitating bird will bob its head and stretch out its neck during the process, and the food it produces will not be digested. In addition, a regurgitating bird will not show signs of illness or distress.</p><p>Regurgitation behavior in birds might best be observed in the nest. When a hen is sitting on eggs, the father of her chicks will many times gorge himself, only to return to the nest and purge to feed his mate. Once the eggs hatch, the resulting baby birds are completely dependent on their parents for food, requiring the adult birds to regurgitate their meals to feed their newborn offspring. It is a very efficient way of delivering food to their young. They needn't carry anything and it has already been warmed up. because it is partially digested, it is a little easier for the babies to absorb the food delivered to them.</p><p>Regurgitation is also a way that birds show each other that they are ""interested."" This is a natural courting behavior, and it's very common for pet birds to regurgitate on other birds, their favorite people, or even their favorite toys. If your bird regurgitates on you, it's most likely a sign of affection.</p><h2>Why Do Birds Vomit? </h2><p>While regurgitation is completely normal behavior, it is important to note that your bird may not be truly regurgitating every time it throws up. If it is vomiting rather than regurgitating, there is a good chance that it is ill or suffering from parasites.</p><p>It can be difficult to distinguish regurgitation from vomiting, but it's important to do so. While true regurgitation is not stressful or violent in nature, a bird that is vomiting from illness will sometimes quickly flick its head, slinging the partially digested food all over. You may find digested food around the cage, or notice that your bird's head feathers are stuck together or caked with food.</p><p>A vomiting bird will spew the contents of its stomach in a very messy and random manner. A bird that is regurgitating food brings it up from its crop and it is far more precise; in other words, its aim is better when it is regurgitating.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If you notice any sign that makes you think your bird could be vomiting from an illness, it is important to contact an avian vet immediately for an examination.</p><h2>How to Prevent Vomiting in Birds </h2><p>There is no way (or reason) to prevent regurgitation in birds, as it's a natural behavior.</p><p>In addition, keep a careful eye on your bird and check the cage when you're cleaning it. If you notice signs of vomiting as opposed to regurgitation, take your bird to the vet as quickly as possible. While the problem may be benign, it may also be an early sign of a potentially serious problem.</p>",565
112,https://www.thesprucepets.com/night-frights-in-pet-birds-390414,Birds > Parrot & Pet Bird Basics > Pet Bird Care,<h1>Night Frights in Pet Birds</h1>,"<h1>Night Frights in Pet Birds</h1><p>Have you ever been awakened in the middle of the night by thrashing and a great deal of commotion going on under one of your covered cages? It happened to me the other night. I heard all of this jumping around, a bell clanging and scratching of paper. I jumped out of bed, hurried to my living room and lifted one of my African Grey's covers. Parker was on the floor of the cage and seemed distraught.</p><p>I picked him up and held him. His heart was beating hard and he seemed upset. I took him into my room, sat on my bed and just held him for a while until he settled down and began cooing. I simply talked to him softly and he was just fine after a few minutes. What happened? Well, I think it was a ""night fright.""</p><h2>Potential Causes of Pet Bird Night Fright </h2><p>It has happened rarely with my birds as I am fairly consistent with their care. I think the change in his cage position might have been what caused his reaction. I had swapped Parker and Nyla's cages just for a change of view and to see if they preferred those positions. Nyla liked where she was just fine. But I don't think Parker took to his new place in the room. While it hasn't happened since, this might well have been the case.</p><p>There are a few things that might cause these night frights. A perceived threat can be a noise outside, the sound of a truck, a sudden flashing light or a vibration. Any little variation in their routine can cause this. Cage not covered enough that is letting in light that changes with a flashing of car headlights? Cage covered too densely with no light emitting at all? Any of these can cause a night fright.</p><h2>Bird Species Susceptibility </h2><p>Cockatiels are especially vulnerable to these episodes of night frights. But it does happen with other species. I've had this happen a few times with my Greys over the years. Cockatiels are ground feeders and, in the wild, they've had to develop some wickedly quick escape routines. It's a fairly dangerous thing to feed on the ground due to predators looking for a snack. So they have developed whip-fast responses to any potential threat by wildly flapping and flying for a quick escape. They travel in flocks and look out for each other and are all sentries for the entire flock's welfare. If one perceives a threat, the entire flock will escape the area in a flash by flying out rapidly.</p><p>Parrots are prey animals and use these instincts to escape any perceived threat. However a bird in a cage and covered cannot escape. If she flies up, she's going to hit the ceiling of the cage. These episodes aren't fun and can be potentially dangerous.</p><h2>Night Fright Prevention </h2><p>I have found something that helps prevent this and that is running an air purifier at night. The sound of the ""white noise"" of the fan seems to keep them calm and masks any outdoor noise that may disturb them.</p><p>I don't know what caused this episode that caused Byron to have his night fright. He is a pretty secure bird and was very calm for the most part. But something as simple as not enough light or too much light with shadows can cause this in a bird. They are built to react this way and instinctively respond to these natural tendencies to flee.</p><p>Being consistent with their care and being observant of their surroundings are ways to help prevent these episodes from occurring.</p>",600
113,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-that-your-bird-is-depressed-390423,Birds > Pet Bird Health & Wellness,<h1>Signs That Your Bird Is Depressed</h1>,"<h1>Signs That Your Bird Is Depressed</h1><p>Not only are birds capable of becoming depressed, but prolonged depression can lead to self-destructive behaviors, lowered immune response, and an array of other problems. If you suspect that your bird may be depressed, compare its behavior with the points listed here. Signs pointing to depression may signal that you need to change something about your bird's environment or your level of interaction with your pet.</p><h2>Appetite Loss </h2><p>Although it can be a symptom of several different types of issues in pet birds, one big indicator of depression is appetite loss. Because birds have such fast metabolisms, it's important to learn to recognize it very quickly if your bird stops eating. Weight loss can come quickly and be very harmful to a bird, so if you notice that your pet's food intake has changed for two consecutive days, you will want to schedule an appointment with your avian vet to investigate the matter.</p><h2>Aggression </h2><p>One of the biggest and most easily recognizable signs that a bird is depressed is a sudden change in personality. Often, especially in parrots, this manifests itself as aggression. While aggression can be seasonal and related to hormonal issues, continually out-of-character behavior may be a sign that your bird is chronically unhappy. To be safe, have any sudden behavior changes investigated by a vet to rule out medical concerns. If your bird has a clean bill of physical health, then you should begin to assess what is going on in your bird's life that could have triggered the behavior.</p><h2>Feather Plucking </h2><p>When a bird starts feather plucking, it can quickly progress into a chronic and devastating problem. If you start noticing bald patches on your bird, have your avian vet check things out so that you can rule out disease. Once you are certain that there isn't a medical issue in play, then you can try to figure out why your bird is plucking. Many birds start to pluck out of boredom or when they aren't getting enough social interaction, so scheduling more time with your bird each day may be what your pet needs most of all.</p><h2>Change in Vocalizations </h2><p>You know your bird better than anybodyand if you have owned it for a while, then you should be pretty familiar with the frequency and types of vocalizations that your feathered friend makes on an average day. If you begin to notice a change in the level or kind of vocalizations that your bird is making, then it could be a sign that your pet is experiencing depression. Many birds resort to screaming out of boredom or frustration, so if your bird is louder than normal, it may be a sign that your pet would like to spend more time interacting with you.</p><h2>Stress Bars </h2><p>Another indicator that your bird could be stressed or depressed is the presence of stress bars on his or her feathers. While stress bars aren't a health concern, they can clue you into problems with your bird's overall happiness and quality of life. If you notice stress bars on your pet, take a good look at your bird's diet, environment, play schedule, and interactions with you. If you see areas that could be improved, step things up a little bit and see if you can tell the difference in the way your bird looks and feels.</p>",586

Pumpkins are a popular food choice for chickens, but are they healthy and safe for a chicken to consume? Find out what types of gourds can be given to your pet chickens and what health benefits they have.</p><h2>Are Pumpkins Safe for Chickens? </h2><p>Yes! Pumpkins are not only safe for chickens to eat, but they love eating them, too. Chickens will peck at the rind, flesh, leaves, and seeds. All the parts of a pumpkin are safe for a chicken to eat, but the rind and flesh are the most popular.</p><p>Pumpkins are a type of winter squash and because they are rich in vitamin A, they are a healthy food for chickens. Like other fruits and vegetables, there are many different varieties or kinds of pumpkins but most people offer their chickens the types of pumpkins they carve at Halloween or use to make pumpkin pie. These pumpkins are commonly referred to as ""field"" and ""canning pumpkins,"" but your chickens won't care what kind of pumpkins they're offered. They'll enjoy pecking at and eating whatever pumpkin you throw their way. </p><h2>Tips for Feeding Pumpkins to Chickens </h2><p>While your chickens will spend as much time as necessary pecking at a whole pumpkin you toss at them, breaking it up for your chicken will make it easier for them to eat it. This gives you a good excuse to smash some pumpkins or simply cut up pieces of them to spread around the enclosure. The seeds or pepitas can be spread around the enclosure separately from the pumpkin pieces to give your chickens something to forage.</p><p>To make the pumpkin even more manageable or to ensure none of the nutritious squash goes to waste, some chicken owners, like Michael Richmond, hobby farmer and backyard chicken enthusiast, recommend putting the pumpkin pieces in a food processor. This finely chopped pumpkin can then be easily stored in the fridge and offered to your chickens for a few days as a treat.</p><h2>What Other Gourds Are Safe for Chickens? </h2><p>In addition to feeding pumpkins, various gourds including squash and zucchini can be given to chickens.</p><h2>Other Plants That Are Safe for Chickens </h2><p>If you want to try feeding something other than gourds to your chickens, consider offering other plants from your garden or grocery store. Several vegetables, flowers, and herbs can be safely fed to chickens in addition to their regular diet.</p><p>Be aware that if you allow your chickens to roam in or near your garden, they may help themselves to these and other items. Some people even purposefully plant chicken gardens to give their chickens fresh foods while encouraging natural foraging behavior. They may then keep a separate garden that is closed off from the flock to grow things they'd like to save for themselves.</p><h2>Plants You Shouldn't Feed to Chickens </h2><p>Despite the plethora of gourd and other garden options that you can feed your chickens, they can't eat everything. Similarly to dogs and cats, there are a few plants and parts of plants that can be dangerous, and even toxic to chickens.</p><p>If you have a garden that your chickens can access, make sure you don't grow these and other things that can make them sick.

Because of that, however, pet birdsespecially the highly intelligent kinds, like parrotscan get bored if they're not engaged regularly.</p><p>While keeping such intelligent creatures constantly occupied seems like an almost impossible task, particularly when you're out of the house, there are ways to ensure your pet bird doesn't suffer from boredom.</p><h2>Hold Your Bird Regularly </h2><p>Taking a few minutes out of each day to hold and handle your bird can provide immense positive mental stimulation to your feathered friend. Handling your bird often also helps develop and maintain the bond that you have with your pet. Ask any bird ownerthe happiest parrots are those who get to spend the most time with their people.</p><p>Not only do most tame pet birds enjoy physical contact from their owners, handling your bird every day will help you become more familiar with your bird's body and understand their body language. This gives you the upper hand in discovering any physical abnormalities and changes to personality that could signal illness or injury.</p><h2>Rotate the Bird's Toys </h2><p>Much like young children, birds get bored playing with the same old toys after a while. Bird toys can be pricy, though, so some owners opt to keep a stash of several different types of toysand rotate different ones in and out of their bird's cage every couple of weeks. This way, your bird will get to play with ""new"" toys every now and then, which will help keep him mentally occupied. Make a quick batch of homemade bird toys to offer even more variety to your feathered friend.</p><h2>Teach Tricks to Your Bird </h2><p>The time that you'll spend working with your bird when teaching the animal some tricks, plus the tasty treats that he or she will get as a reward for a job well done, provides plenty of stimulation for your pet. At the same time, it provides socialization time and strengthens the bird-owner bond.</p><p>As your bird progresses, you can always add new tricks to help keep the process fresh. An added bonus: You'll have a great time showing off how cute and smart your pet is!</p><h2>Play Music or Videos </h2><p>Birds are naturally interested in different sounds and noises, so leaving a radio or television helps to keep them happy and comfortable while they are spending time in their cages. You can even log the types of music that your bird responds to the most or check out some popular songs about birds to make a custom playlist for your feathered friend.</p><h2>Provide Plenty of Food Options and Foraging Opportunities </h2><p>In the wild, parrots dine on an array of different fruits, vegetables, seeds, berries, and nuts. It's no wonder, then, that they tend to get bored in captivity eating the same old pellets and seed mix day after day. Additionally, they have to find food in the wild and spend hours doing this- encourage this behavior at home with your parrot by introducing foraging!</p><p>Along with keeping your bird happy and occupied, adding more variety to your bird's diet in the form of fresh fruits and vegetables can give your bird's body a healthy boost of vitamins and nutrients. For extra fun and expanded options, cook up some homemade bird treats in your own kitchen. Place these treats into paper that is easily shreddable, or pick up a puzzle from the pet store to put it in and watch them work out how to get to it- its a big reward mentally for them!</p>",585
