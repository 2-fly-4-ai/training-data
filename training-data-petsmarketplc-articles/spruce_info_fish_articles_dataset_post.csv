The soft inner illumination of a lighted aquarium makes it a beautiful element of room decor. And both the fish and the live plants in your aquarium require light to thrive. But determining how much light the fish and plants need, and controlling that amount, can be tricky.</p><h2>How Much Light Is Needed? </h2><p>In general, most aquariums require eight to 12 hours of light each day (10 hours is a good starting point), provided by aquarium lights.</p><h2>Light Needs for Live Aquatic Plants </h2><p>A primary reason for using supplemental aquarium lighting is to provide the light necessary for living aquatic plants to perform their necessary photosynthesis. Just like land-based plants, aquatic plants use light to synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water, and they obtain this light both from ambient room light and from supplemental aquarium lighting. </p><p>If there are live plants in the aquarium, the supplemental lighting period will probably need to be maximized. Plants require as much as 12 hours of light per day, but the precise length of time will depend on the aquarium setup and species of plants. If, on the other hand, your tank has no living aquatic plants, your lighting needs will be less only what is necessary for the fish.</p><p>It is usually recommended that the aquatic plants in your aquarium be matched to the type of fish you are keeping: tropical plants for tropical fish aquariums; temperate cold-water plants for aquariums with cold-water species. Light levels should also be chosen to match the natural environment of the plants.</p><p>Tropical plants that will thrive on roughly 12 hours of light each day, all year long, include the banana, Amazon, Java, and water fern plants. Cold water plants that do best with seasonal variations in light levels include the species and tiger lotus.</p><p>When you introduce new live plants to your aquarium, it is best to leave the light on for longer times; this gives the plants a better chance to take root and grow vigorously when being established.</p><h2>Ambient Room Lighting </h2><p>Determining the length of time to run your aquarium lights will depend on how much ambient light is already in the room. It is even possible that you will need no additional lighting at all, if, for example, your aquarium is in a bright south-facing sunroom with lots of windows or an active family room where ceiling lights and lamps are on most of the time. Ambient room lighting is often rather indirect, though, and chances are good that no matter how much light already is present in the room, you will need to run aquarium lights each day. But a room with good ambient lighting will not need 12 hours of aquarium lights.</p><p>It is also good to leave the aquarium lighting on longer in the winter when natural light is less due to the season. This will promote better growth and healthier aquarium plants. As the days lengthen, the aquarium lighting period can be shortened. </p><h2>Light Needs for Different Fish Species </h2><p>When it comes to the fish themselves, aquarium lighting is mostly about you, not them. Lighting in an aquarium makes it easier for you to see and enjoy your fish, but it usually does not affect the fish all that much. The nature of an aquarium, with its four glass sides and relatively small size, means that most fish are getting more light than they do in natural settings, whether or not you are using supplemental lights. Most fish do not mind getting more light.</p><p>A few species, such as cichlids and tetras, thrive on less light, and for these, too much supplemental aquarium lighting may affect them negatively.</p><p>Consider the conditions that a species experiences in the wild when determining how much extra lighting, if any, is required. Tropical fish have evolved under conditions that provided roughly 12 hours of light each day, so logic suggests that an aquarium with tropical fish will likely need a combination of ambient and aquarium lighting for roughly half the day.</p><p>On the other hand, cold-water species such as goldfish, minnows, ricefish, and danios (zebrafish) are from temperate climate zones where the daylight hours vary according to the season. For these fish, you might want to vary the amount of light over the year. To create a more natural environment, match the length of aquarium lighting to what the species experiences in its native environment. </p><h2>Light and Algae Levels </h2><p>If excess algae is a problem in the aquarium, a contributing factor is usually too much light. Too much light causes more algae growth. Reduce the time the aquarium lights are on to eight hours, or a bit less if necessary, to help reduce the algae growth.</p><p>Monitoring algae levels can, therefore, help you determine if your lighting levels are appropriate. If you begin to see excessive algae, shorten the periods of light to retard the algae growth. But remember, you do not want to have too little light on for the aquarium plants,</p><p>Direct sunlight tends to create more algae than does artificial light. An aquarium near a sunny window may require less supplemental lighting than one on an interior wall. </p><h2>Controlling Lighting in Your Aquarium </h2><p>The biggest obstacle to maintaining a uniform period of aquarium lighting is that owners find it difficult to turn the lights on and off at the same time each day. Fortunately, there is an inexpensive and easy way to remedy that problem. Purchase an on-off timer and plug the lighting unit into it. Set the on and off times to obtain the desired period of light. On-off timers are highly recommended for all aquarium owners.</p><h2>Aquarium Lights and Heat </h2><p>Remember that aquarium lights may not only produce light but many produce heat, and sometimes a lot of it. Lighting types that produce heat include incandescent, VHO-fluorescent, and metal halide. In smaller aquariums, these types can cause a significant rise in water temperature, sometimes enough to kill your fish and plants. If you use one of these types of lights, make sure to monitor the water temperature constantly, and avoid leaving the lights on overnight. </p><p>Standard fluorescent lights produce cooler light and are a better choice for most aquariums. You can leave them on for long periods without danger, and many tropical fish and plants thrive under fluorescent lighting. Light Emitting Diode (LED lights) come in a variety of colors and are inexpensive to run and they are cool in operation.</p><h2> Aquarium Lighting Tips </h2><p>True aquatic plants must be kept wet at all times or else they might die. Do not run them under running water, the chlorine can damage or even kill the plants. If you see a whitish slime on plants, this slime layer is good bacteria. Fish eat it, it is entirely natural, and is part of what keeps an aquarium in homeostasis.</p><p>Ensure that live plants are well anchored in the substrate. Do not plant in big thickets (bunches or clumps). The plants need room to grow and get full light on all the branches and leaves. Your fish should be able to swim cleanly around and through your aquarium plants.</p><p>Many aquarium plants can increase their numbers naturally. Vallisneria and similar plants send out runners under the substrate, which then sprout next to the parent plant. You can cut away the runners and replant them to start a new thicket.</p><p>Aquarium Components: Lighting. , 2020</p>",1220
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/saltwater-aquarium-mistakes-2925691,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>The 11 Most Common Mistakes Made by Saltwater Aquarium Keepers</h1>,"<h1>The 11 Most Common Mistakes Made by Saltwater Aquarium Keepers</h1><p>No matter what kind of aquarium keeper you are, here is a list of the most common mistakes you may be making. These problems can be avoided if you're aware of them before you start an aquarium.</p><h2>Overfeeding Fish and Invertebrates </h2><p>How much food should you feed your fish? Do you add more because they always seem hungry? It is important to supply your fish the food they need, but uneaten food just lays on the bottom of the tank, creating ammonia, nitrite and nitrate and overloading the biological filter.</p><p>Not fully understanding the nutritional requirements of their fish, the tendency of many people is to ""throw food"" at fish in order to fulfill their needs. If the fish are not accepting the food offered, many aquarists will ""throw even more"" at the fish, thinking that the fish just isn't seeing the food. It is important to feed the correct type of food for the inhabitants in your aquarium and feed them the appropriate amount.</p><p>Most aquarium fish will do well with commercial flake or pelleted food, but you should ask your fish supplier if the fish and invertebrates you are buying for your saltwater aquarium have any special dietary needs. Know what is in the food you are feeding by comparing the nutrients in commercial foods, purchasing only high-quality foods, and feeding only what your fish will consume in three to five minutes per feeding. Feed once or twice per day, depending on the age and species of fish.</p><h2>Moving Too Fast </h2><p>""Patience"" is a requirement for just about anything that you do with a saltwater aquarium. Far too many people report problems after they have put their aquarium together because they are just moving too fast! A high percentage of people do not take the time to read and study up on the fish keeping hobby before getting started. Make sure that you know the requirements of any new species you plan on adding to your saltwater aquarium, and check on their compatibility with the species you already have. When adding fish into your new aquarium, only add a few at a time over the first 4-6 weeks until you have stocked your aquarium. Do not add all of the fish at once.</p><h2>Overloading the System </h2><p>A problem that goes hand-in-hand with moving too fast is cramming too much livestock and/or live rock into the aquarium all at once, especially in a tank that is not fully cycled or has just completed the nitrogen cycling process.</p><p>Even in a well-established system, placing too many new additions into the tank too quickly can cause new tank syndrome. Slow down! Saltwater aquarium keeping is not a timed event, so take it easy, and work on your patience skills. Let the aquarium water quality get balanced after each new addition before purchasing more fish or invertebrates.</p><h2>Inadequate Filtration and Water Circulation </h2><p>Having sufficient biological filtration is a primary key to success in keeping a saltwater aquarium. There are a number of filtration methods to choose from, but not making the right filter selection for the bio-load planned for your aquarium can lead to a wide variety of problems. Whether it be biological, mechanical, or chemical, it's better to have more filtration, rather than too little for the size of your aquarium.</p><p>This same concept applies to the circulation of the water in the aquarium, as well. The lack of good water flow throughout the system can lead to problems with low DO (dissolved oxygen), the build-up of nuisance algae, the prevention of sedentary animals receiving food, and more. The solution? Add a powerhead or two, or a surge device to improve water movement in the aquarium.</p><h2>Misdiagnosing Diseases </h2><h2>Overmedicating </h2><p>Way too often one or more remedies are just thrown at a sick or ailing fish without knowing what is the real problem. Medications should only be used when necessary, and whenever possible treat the fish in a quarantine tank. The most important factor with medications is to use one that is formulated to ""target"" the specific disease you are dealing with. Always know the exact water volume in the treated aquarium and follow the medication label dosing instructions accurately.</p><h2>Purchasing Animals Without Knowing Anything About Them </h2><p>It never ceases to amaze us how often people select new additions to their aquarium without knowing what the animals are, and how to care for and feed them. Before purchasing anything, take the time to first obtain information about it. The new addition may not be suited to live with the species already in your aquarium!</p><p>You shouldn't buy on impulse because you like the pretty colors a fish has, how cute or stunning it looks, or for any other ""touchy-feely"" reason, or if a salesperson can't provide you with critical information you need to know about a particular animal. Be sure there is room enough in your aquarium for the ADULT SIZE of the fish you are interested in, and that it is compatible with the existing species you have.</p><h2>Livestock Incompatibility </h2><p>Statements like and similar ones are all too frequently heard. Purchasing livestock without knowing whether or not they will peacefully reside with other tank mates can lead to dead or injured animals, as well as stress-related diseases. Use common sense and learn about the compatibility of animals you are considering for your aquarium before putting them together!</p><h2>Purchasing Animals in Poor Health </h2><p>One of the easiest things to do when selecting a critter is to determine whether or not it is healthy. In a simple phrase, most sick fish don't eat. Before purchasing a fish or other animal, it is best to have a sale's person in a store show you that it is in fact eating.</p><p>Learn how to recognize the symptoms or outward signs of common illnesses so you know what to look for when inspecting livestock to buy. Healthy fish should be actively swimming and have their fins spread out normally, and be interested in food added into the aquarium. Sick fish often will be lethargic, hanging around the top or the bottom of the aquarium, or not schooling with other fish, have fins clamped against their body, and have discoloration or redness to the body and bases of the fins.</p><h2>Using a Poor Quality Fresh Water Source </h2><p>Although many aquarists do so, choosing to use water straight from the tap or un-purified water of another source to make up saltwater solutions and to top off a tank can lead to many water quality issues in aquariums. Using a water purification filter, buying clean natural seawater, or pre-filtered RO/DI water from a reliable supplier is an investment that will pay for itself in the long run. Unless you have tested your tap water to be sure it is appropriate for mixing with your salt to make sea water, ask your fish retailer what they recommend for salt water aquarium use in your area.</p><h2>Lack of Proper Tank Maintenance </h2><p>Well-maintained saltwater systems seldom experience high nitrate, bacterial outbreaks, or other water quality issues. To avoid the usual pitfalls with problems in this area of aquarium keeping, set up and follow a regular maintenance routine.</p><p>Avoiding these common mistakes will help you become a more successful aquarium keeper.</p>",1229
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/routine-aquarium-maintenance-1381084,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Routine Aquarium Maintenance</h1>,"<h1>Routine Aquarium Maintenance</h1><p>A large part of keeping your fish healthy is ensuring that their habitat remains healthy. Regular maintenance is key to keeping the aquarium environment safe. One roadblock for new aquarium owners is not knowing what maintenance they should perform, and when. Experts may disagree on the specific points of aquarium maintenance, but everyone agrees that following a regular routine of any kind is better than no maintenance at all. This is one recommended aquarium maintenance plan.</p><h2>Why Do Maintenance? </h2><p>Often aquarium owners don't give much thought to maintenance. After all, they have a filter, and some bottom-feeding fish to pick up stuff that falls there. So what else is needed? Some will cite the fact that nobody is cleaning the rivers, lakes, and oceans, and the fish do fine. So why clean the aquarium? That's actually a good question. Mother Nature is not idle, she does a pretty good job of cleaning things up in the great outdoors. Lakes, rivers, and oceans are large bodies of water that have currents and waves circulating the water. Rain falling adds fresh water, and live plants produce oxygen while absorbing carbon dioxide. The sheer volume of water also serves to dilute any harmful toxins.</p><p>Unlike bodies of water in nature, an aquarium holds a relatively small amount of water. Add to that the fact that it is a closed system, and it becomes quite different from a habitat in nature. Nothing goes into or out of the tank unless you have a hand in making it happen. Filters certainly help, but if not maintained, filters become clogged and will no longer work properly. Meanwhile, fish continue to produce waste, uneaten food decays, and potentially harmful byproducts slowly build up. The only way an aquarium will remain clean is if you take the time to perform maintenance on a regular basis. Otherwise, the habitat will become unhealthy for the fish over time.</p><h2>Frequency of Maintenance </h2><p>It is neither practical nor healthy to clean every surface in the aquarium on a daily or even weekly basis. For that matter, it's never wise to clean everything in the aquarium at the same time. To minimize the impact cleaning has on beneficial bacteria, cleaning of colony-rich areas, such as the filter and the substrate, should be staggered. If the bacterial colonies are disturbed too much, it can disrupt the nitrogen cycle enough to cause a spike in ammonia and nitrite. For that reason, it's also wise to test the water a few days after a significant cleaning to ensure nothing is amiss.</p><h3>Daily  </h3><p>Do a quick visual check of the aquarium to ensure the filter is running at full strength, the lights are functioning properly, and any other equipment you have is running normally. Check the water temperature to ensure it's in the proper range. Count the fish and check if they appear healthy. A good time to do this is when you feed them, as they will be out and easy to observe. Once they have finished eating, examine the tank to see if there is uneaten food remaining on the bottom. If you notice that there is often uneaten food left after five to 10 minutes, cut back on the volume of food you give your fish at each feeding. Should you notice that uneaten food starts building up on the bottom of the tank, use a siphon or gravel vacuum to remove it. If the water level has dropped, top it off with treated or aged water as needed.</p><p>This is a good time to start an aquarium journal or log if you haven't done so already. While there is no need to record everything, it is helpful to note anything out of the ordinary on your daily checks. That way you can catch trends that may be occurring. For instance, the temperature dropping by a degree isn't a huge deal, but if it drops a degree four days in a row, that's a tip-off that something may be wrong with your heater. All of this can be done in literally a matter of minutes, so it's not a huge time investment.</p><h3>Weekly/Bi-Weekly </h3><p>Some experts are proponents of weekly partial water changes, while others prefer to do them every few weeks. As long as you are regularly performing partial water changes every couple of weeks, the exact frequency is not critical. Use water that is treated to remove chlorine, and if possible, aged. Replacement water should be close to the temperature of the aquarium. However, prior to performing the water change, perform the other weekly and every other week tasks first, such as cleaning algae off the inside of the aquarium glass. Leave the partial water change as the last task.</p><p>The other task that should be performed every week or two is the general cleaning of the tank. By performing light cleaning every couple of weeks, your aquarium will never get overly dirty. Wipe down the outside tank surfaces with a non-ammonia aquarium-safe cleanser, or simply use a damp cloth. Gently shake plants, whether they are live or artificial, to dislodge debris. Scrape the inside glass to remove any algae, then take a break for ten or fifteen minutes and let everything settle a bit. When you come back, gently siphon the substrate to remove debris. Lastly, perform a partial water change. Make notes in your log or journal of the maintenance you performed, and anything unusual going on in the tank.</p><h3>Monthly </h3><p>Water testing should be performed monthly to ensure nothing unseen is brewing. Test the following parameters: pH, ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate. If you have algae problems, you may also test for high phosphate level to see if that may be the cause. Perform water tests first before water changes and any other maintenance. If there are abnormal water test results, check them again after the water change to ensure the parameters are back to normal levels. If you have live plants, inspect them, remove any dead leaves, and trim excess growth.</p><h3>Periodic </h3><p>In addition to the scheduled maintenance tasks, there are a few things that should be done as needed. These include replacing the light bulbs once per year, regardless of whether they have burned out. Inspect the air pump tubing, and the filter tubing if you have a canister filter. Clean the canister filter intake using a filter brush. If you have live plants, fertilize them.</p><h2>Cleaning Equipment </h2><p>Aquarium maintenance does not require a lot of equipment. However, it does help to have a few specialized tools on hand. The most important piece of equipment to have is a dedicated aquarium bucket, and make sure you do not use it for anything else. Having two buckets is helpful, but not absolutely necessary. In addition to the bucket, a siphon, water conditioner, algae scrubber, filter brush, aquarium-safe glass cleaner, soft cloth, and some towels round out your cleaning materials. All of these items can be stored inside the aquarium bucket to make cleaning day quick and easy. Additionally, you'll need fresh filter media and if you have live plants, fertilizer, and small scissors to trim the plants.</p>",1188
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/activated-carbon-in-the-aquarium-1380929,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Using Activated Carbon in Aquarium Filters</h1>,"<h1>Using Activated Carbon in Aquarium Filters</h1><p>Activated carbon has been used in home aquariums for decades, and it is still the largest selling filtration media product. As new types of filters and media have become available, the debate has raged over the value of using activated carbon in filters. Some believe it should be used as a standard media for continuous use in most filters. Others feel it should only be used for special needs, and still, others believe that activated carbon should no longer be used at all.</p><p>It is important to remember that carbon is exhausted relatively quickly when used in an aquarium filter. For that reason, if the choice is made to use activated carbon on an ongoing basis, it should be replaced regularly. Otherwise, it is of little benefit.</p><h2>What Is Activated Carbon? </h2><p>Activated carbon is made from carbonaceous material that has been heat-treated at very high temperatures to create many tiny pores, greatly increasing its surface area. These tiny pores and massive surface area allow the filter media to trap a large volume of material, making it useful for removing pollutants from both air and water. Different methods of creating activated carbon result in different forms of material suitable for different uses. In aquariums, the form mostly used is GAC or .</p><p>There are also different sources for the carbon itself, each resulting in different possible pore sizes. Materials such as coal, coconuts, peat, bamboo, and wood are all used to create activated carbon. For aquariums, the best source is bituminous coal.</p><h2>What Activated Carbon Does </h2><p>Activated carbon adsorbs a number of dissolved contaminants such as chloramine and chlorine, tannins (which color the water), and phenols (which cause odors). It will help keep aquarium water from turning yellow over time.</p><p>It is important to understand that there are several important toxins that activated carbon does remove. Most notably, it does not remove ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate. Therefore, it does not aid in toxin removal during the initial aquarium setup. Water changes or other methods must be used to address elevated ammonia, nitrite, or nitrate levels.</p><p>Heavy metals, such as lead or copper, are also not removed. If your water source has heavy metals, use a water treatment product before putting the water into the aquarium.</p><h2>Activated Carbon and Medications </h2><p>Activated carbon will adsorb many medications used to treat fish disease. Therefore, before treating sick fish with medications, all carbon should be removed from the filter. After the course of treatment is fully completed, it is safe to add activated carbon back to the filter. The carbon will remove any residual medication in the aquarium water.</p><h2>Placement in Filter </h2><p>Activated carbon will lose its effectiveness rather quickly if exposed to lots of debris from the aquarium. Therefore, carbon should be placed the mechanical filtration media in the filter. Keep in mind that if you do not keep your tank clean, and debris builds up in the filter, the activated carbon will not be effective.</p><h2>Changing Activated Carbon </h2><p>Since activated carbon binds with the compounds it removes, it eventually becomes saturated and can no longer remove additional contaminants. Therefore, it must be regularly replaced once per month is usually sufficient. Longer intervals between replacements will not harm the tank, but the carbon will gradually lose its ability to remove toxins from the water. If you see yellowing of the water or smell an odor in your tank, it's past time to change the activated carbon.</p><h2>Myth of Recharging Activated Carbon </h2><p>Stories about recharging activated carbon abound. Some even give step-by-step instructions, which generally involve baking the carbon in your oven. These stories are myths. The temperature and pressure required to recharge exhausted activated carbon cannot be achieved in your kitchen oven. It is better to just buy new carbon from the fish store when needing to replace your activated carbon, and be sure to keep unused activated carbon in an airtight container or it may adsorb odors and chemicals from the air.</p><h2>De-Absorption </h2><p>You may have heard that once activated carbon has reached its capacity, it will start leaching some adsorbed materials back into the water. This is not an accurate claim. Although technically possible, de-adsorbing requires changes in water chemistry that simply do not occur in an aquarium.</p><p>However, the processes used to create some activated carbon can result in the presence of phosphate in the end product. In this case, it is possible for phosphate already present in the activated carbon to leach into the aquarium water. Some activated carbon products will specifically state if they are phosphate-free.</p><p>If you are having difficulties with persistently elevated phosphate and can find no other cause, remove the activated carbon entirely. Perform normal tank maintenance for a couple of months and see if the phosphate remains elevated. If it stays high, the carbon was probably not the reason for your elevated phosphate.</p><h2>Cautions With Carbon </h2><p>In general, using activated carbon in your filter is a good thing, but not a necessity. If you are testing your water, doing regular partial water changes, and dechlorinating the replacement tap water, you really don't need to use carbon. It is just an additional expense since the carbon needs to be replaced every month.</p><p>The carbon in a recirculating filter system will also act as a home to the beneficial bacteria that turn ammonia into nitrite and then nitrate. When you change the carbon each month, you are throwing away part of the biofilter, and it will take a while for the new carbon to grow beneficial bacteria on it. If the carbon media is a significant percentage of your filtration system, you will be losing your biofilter with each replacement. An ammonia spike could possibly occur after adding the new carbon. To prevent this from happening, use sponges, beads, bioballs, or ceramic beads in sufficient quantity in the filter to act as the main media for bacteria that form the biofilter.</p><p>Powder activated carbon, when used in the filter system, has been reported to blow into the aquarium as a fine dust that gets trapped on the gills of the fish. There are cases where the fish have died after using powdered carbon that wasn't properly contained in a media bag in the filter. Necropsy on the dead fish found carbon particles in their gills and fin tissues. Using larger pelleted or granular activated carbon, and rinsing the dust off with distilled water before placing it into your filter chamber will prevent that problem. Use distilled or deionized water for rinsing the new carbon to prevent it from adsorbing chlorine from the tap water before it is even placed into your filter!</p>",1094
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/koi-pond-guide-5115233,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>A Comprehensive Guide to Koi Ponds</h1>,"<h1>A Comprehensive Guide to Koi Ponds</h1><p>Koi ponds are a common feature in many home landscapes worldwide. Learn more about what these ponds are, their history, and how to build and maintain a proper home for these beautiful fish.</p><h2>What Is a Koi pond? </h2><p>A koi pond is so much more than a simple hole in the ground with fish in it. Koi ponds have a very long history, dating back several centuries in Asia. Today, they are a common feature of many yards and are designed to hold large, ornamental nishikigoi (brocaded carp), commonly called koi.</p><h2>History of Koi Ponds </h2><p>Descendants of the Common Carp () bred with the Amur carp (), koi were kept in Asia as a food source for many centuries. In the early 1800s, carp farmers in Japan noted natural color mutations of the fish, and those fish were set aside in special ponds. Countless generations of selective breeding later, we have the colorful koi we know today. Koi were introduced to the world in 1914 at the Tokyo Agricultural Exhibition, where the farmers first brought their colored carp for public display.</p><p>Today's koi have 15 different major varieties, including the doitsu (Japanese for ""German""), a scaleless variety of koi, and the long-fin or butterfly koi, with long flowing fins and ruffled nasal folds. Koi can be very valuable pets, with the most expensive koi ever being sold in 2020 for $1.8 million.</p><p>There are koi shows all over the world, and just like shows for cats and dogs, there are strict guidelines that only the best koi can achieve. Many koi in the US are shipped directly from Japan and are held at a higher regard than domestic or US-bred fish. They are also sold for a higher price.</p><h2>Common Features of Koi Ponds </h2><p>Rather than a hole in the ground containing a few fish, koi ponds are practical and elegant homes for fish of all sizes and colorations. For best health, it is recommended to have at least 250 gallons of water per koi fish, and some large, breeding females may require up to 500 gallons per fish, due to their massive bulk when full of eggs in breeding season.</p><p>In addition to the main pond, all koi ponds require an efficient filtration setup. This is a combination of mechanical, biological and other filtration components.</p><h3>Mechanical Filtration </h3><p>These stages trap solid particulates from the pond water, which can clog biological filtration if not removed. This may include a skimmer basket, settling tank, open-cell foam sheets, sieve filter, or drum filter. The mechanical filter needs to be frequently cleaned to remove trapped wastes to keep it working properly.</p><h3>Biological Filtration </h3><p>These components house beneficial bacteria that remove ammonia and nitrate from the nitrogen cycle. The most common component in many koi ponds is a pressurized bead filter. These filters contain many small plastic beads with high surface area for holding the good nitrifying bacteria. These filters needs to be backwashed weekly to prevent compaction. Other biological filtration options include running filter water through gravel beds, lava rocks, bakki showers, plastic matting, recycled strapping, or other porous, non-degrading materials. Be careful not to overclean these components with chlorinated water, hot water, or a pressure washer, as that can remove the beneficial bacteria that grow on the surface of the media.</p><h3>Other Filtration </h3><p>Most koi ponds should include UV (ultraviolet) filtration. This filter consists of a UV bulb contained within an opaque housing that the pond water is pumped through. This is used to zap algae and other biologic particulates. These UV light bulbs will need to be cleaned periodically and replaced every year.</p><h2>How to Build a Koi Pond </h2><p>Although many homeowners are fully capable of DIY koi pond construction, consulting with a professional builder is always recommended. Planning all your components and layout is critical to achieving a successful koi pond. Start by determining how many fish you want and work backwards from there, provided your yard has enough room. Or you can start with your desired koi pond size and choose corresponding components. Koi should be kept in a fish tank; it is<br/>too small for koi, most of which can top out at 24 to 36 inches in length. Some large females have reached over 40 inches in length!</p><p>When selecting filtration, it is best to overestimate your total pond water volume and choose components that are slightly larger than required for your pond. For example, if your pond is 4000 gallons, choose a filter rated for a pond of 5000- to 6000-gallon capacity. This will provide you a little wiggle room as your filtration is being established and if you happen to forget any regular maintenance. The flow rate from the water pump through the filter should be high enough to pass the total water volume through it every two to four hours. So a 4000 gallon pond should have a water pump that pushes water through the filter at 1000 to 2000 gallons per hour.</p><h2>What Types of Fish Live in Koi Ponds </h2><p>The most traditional occupant of a koi pond is a koi fish (). Other good choices for a koi pond is their close cousin, the goldfish (). It is a myth that koi and goldfish cannot be kept together. Given their phylogenetic relationship, they share all the same bacteria and parasites, and even some viruses, such as Koi Herpes Virus (KHV). Fancy goldfish with the rounded body shapes do  do well in koi ponds, given how much swimming is required, so stick to comet goldfish for ponds. Other koi pond inhabitants may include common catfish, provided they can't wrap their mouths around any koi, and high fin sharks.</p><h2>Koi Pond Maintenance </h2><p>There are daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal (usually twice a year), and yearly tasks that must be performed to maintain your koi pond. Please note: these are general guidelines only. Your pond's tasks may vary depending on your filtration, size of the pond and number of fish.</p>",1017

When a glass aquarium is constructed, the structural integrity (what keeps it from falling apart) and water tight integrity are established where the glass meets the glass. If you look at where the glass panels meet, that bare fraction of an inch between the glass panels held together by silicone is where the rubber meets the road, so to speak. Water tightness and strength are minimally increased with the silicone that is spread out inside the tank where the glass panels meet. If the tank has been constructed properly and the silicone between the glass panel edges is flawless with no bubbles or gaps in the silicone, the tank will hold water without leaking.</p><h2>Find the Leak </h2><p>Finding where the leak originated can be difficult. It seems like, nine times out of ten, it isn't where you are seeing the water on the outside of the tank. If the tank is fairly old, wasn't constructed properly, or hasn't been cleaned carefully over the years, you may notice the silicone sealant separating or curling up from the glass inside the tank. If there is some obvious damage to the silicone sealant in the tank, that would be a good place to start looking for the origination of the leak.</p><h2>Search the Seams </h2><p>Sometimes the leak appears as a tiny stream of water shooting out of a silicone seam in the glass. If there is not obvious damage to the silicone behind the water stream, there is a simple way to find the origin of the leak. Fill a syringe with colored water (food coloring works well). Insert the syringe needle into the silicone where the water is coming out and slowly depress the syringe plunger. You will be able to see the colored water enter the silicone and follow the trail of the ""tunnel"" that the tank water followed back to its origin.</p><p>Keep in mind that every aquarium leak starts from the inside of the tank. While you may be able to smear some silicone on the outside of the tank where the water is showing up, that won't stop the leak where it begins. Also, keep in mind that water can run a long way between the silicone and the glass in the tank seams before it finally appears outside the tank.</p><h2>Repair Techniques </h2><p>No matter from where the leak starts, in order to repair it you are going to have to drain the water down to below where the leak starts unless you decide to just smear some silicone on the outside of the tank where the leaking water is showing. You can also try to use a strip of duct tape to stop the leak. From our experience, neither of these fixes work for long, if at all. The main reason that resealing the tank from the inside, rather than the outside is that when the patch is on the inside, the water pressure presses the patch into the glass, whereas with the outside patch, the water pressure is pressing the patch away from the glass.</p><p>Get a siphon hose and start draining the tank an inch or so at a time. Keep an eye on where the water shows up on the outside of the tank, and when it stops leaking, stop draining the tank. Follow the water level around the tank, looking for damage to the silicone in the tank, looking for silicone that is loose or other silicone damage. On the outside of the tank, mark the damage location with the felt tip marker. If you have determined that the leak originates at the bottom of the tank, drain the tank down entirely and remove the substrate. It may seem like a lot of trouble to go to, but in the end, you will find that it is easier to do than fighting the water and substrate contaminating the repair site.</p><p>At this point, you will probably want to move the fish and other critters in the aquarium to a temporary tank.</p><h2>What You'll Need </h2><h2>Instructions </h2><h3>Scrape Away Old Silicone </h3><p>To start the repair, with the single edge razor blade, cleanly cut the silicone 1"" around where the leak has originated from. Scrape all of the silicone off the glass without letting the blade go between the panes of glass. Clean the scraped area with a paper towel soaked with acetone and let dry.</p><h3>Apply New Silicone </h3><p>When the repair site is dry, open the silicone tube and apply the silicone to the site, coming up over the old silicone on either side of the leak site. Smooth the silicone down and out with a piece of paper (a business card works great) or flexible piece of plastic. Don't just gob the silicone on the site thinking that a lot of material will do the job. Not only does it look ugly, it usually doesn't make a good seal.</p><h3>Let Dry and Refill </h3><p>Once you have finished applying and smoothing the silicone into place, allow the silicone to dry for 24 hours and then refill the tank with freshwater (no sense wasting sea salts if the patch doesn't work) and check for leaks. Let the tank stand for 24 hours to make sure that it isn't leaking again, then drain it and set it up again, just like starting over with a new tank.</p><p>If your repair didn't work you may have to strip the tank and make a Major Aquarium Repair.</p>",1001
6,https://www.thesprucepets.com/designing-a-glass-aquarium-2924666,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Designing a Glass Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>Designing a Glass Aquarium</h1><p>Designing a custom glass aquarium is pretty straightforward. It is a matter of selecting the size of the aquarium and the glass thickness to be used, then put it all together to build your DIY aquarium. Just follow the steps, one at a time, and you will be surprised at how easy it really is.</p><p>You will need measuring tape for this design process.</p><h2>Determine the Footprint </h2><p>Determine the ""footprint"" (front to back, side to side measurement) of the tank. To a great extent, the footprint will be determined by the final location of the tank and the stand that it will rest upon. Make a note of the tank footprint measurements. Remember that aquariums are heavy (about 10 pounds per gallon capacity of water) so be sure your stand is strong enough to support the aquarium size you plan to build.</p><h2>Select the Right Glass Thickness </h2><p>In order to determine the size of the side glass panels, you will first need to determine the thickness of the glass you will be using. Note that the side pieces are set inside the front and back panels, and their dimensions are determined after you choose the glass thickness.</p><p>Refer to the chart to help you determine this. This chart is based on single strength glass, as opposed to tempered or ""safety"" glass. Single strength glass is what you see in most aquariums as well as the windows in your house. It can be cut to whatever size you wish and the sharp edges can be ground smooth to avoid injuries.</p><p>Find the length of the tank in the top row, then follow that column down until you reach the height of the tank on the left hand column. Glass thickness is indicated in millimeters (mm), with the number in parenthesis below it indicating the safety factor. To help you choose between thicknesses, aim for the thickness that has a safety factor of 3.8 or greater.</p><p>Warren Stilwell explains the safety factor on the Federation of New Zealand Aquatic Societies website. A factor of 3.8 is used to account for the variability of the strength of glass due to the manufacturing process. He notes that the joining compound (commonly silicone) should be at least 0.5 to 1 mm thick to allow for any irregularities along the edge of the glass. The edges must be ground or they will not be flat.</p><h2>How to Maintain an Acceptable Safety Factor With Thinner Glass </h2><p>If you want to use a thinner glass to keep your costs down and still maintain an acceptable safety factor, you can simply design your tank as if it were two tanks by installing a front-to-back brace across the top/center of the tank. This effectively turns a 4-foot long tank into two 2-foot long tanks by supporting the top center of the front and back panes of glass.</p><p>To demonstrate this idea, look at the 21-inch high, 4-foot wide tank line in the chart. It indicates that using 9 mm glass will give you a safety factor of 2.92. However, if you use a front to back brace, structurally turning the tank into two 2-foot wide tanks, it increases the safety factor of using 9 mm thick glass to 4.1, which is a very satisfactory safety factor. If the side panels are no more than 2 feet, they will also have a safety factor of 4.1.</p><p>If you want to have a flat-topped tank, you can install (using silicone adhesive) the brace between the front and back panels, level with the top of the tank. Three inches would be a good width for the brace, but if you are going to install a glass canopy on the tank, adjust the brace width to accommodate the canopy. If you want more strength in the center of the tank, you can use two narrower braces siliconed together.</p><h2>Determine the Width of the Side Glass Panels </h2><p>Since the side panels of glass will be INSIDE of the front and back panels of glass, their width needs to be decreased from the measurement of the bottom panel from front to back, to fit inside. Once you have determined the thickness of the glass you will be using for the front and back panels, calculating the width of the side panels is simple. Double the thickness of the glass and then subtract that number from the front to back measurement of the bottom panel. That will give you the width you need for each side panel.</p><p>Example: If the front-to-back measurement of the bottom panel is 18 inches and you are using 1/4-inch glass, your side panel width would be 17 1/2 inches. This width will fit between the front and back plates, all of which are on top of the bottom plate of glass.</p><h2>Design to Prevent Failures </h2> <p>Prevent the first two causes by avoiding striking the tank and scratching or chipping it. Preventing glass in an aquarium from bending to the breaking point is pretty simple, too. The glass at the bottom and sides of the aquarium can't bend if the silicone adheres to the glass. The normal place for aquarium glass to bend is at the top edges of the front and back panels. The thicker the glass is, the more pressure it can take without bending, or you can simply brace the top edges to keep them from bending.</p><p>Many of the manufactured glass aquariums you see on the market employ plastic or metal bracing around the top of the tank as well as a piece across the center. This allows them to use a thinner glass and also provide a bracket to hold glass canopies. Many of the manufacturers will also use angle plastic or metal along the bottom and sides. This can be for cosmetic effect (looks) or to help hold the joints together.</p><p>Now that you have the dimensions and the glass thickness selected, your aquarium design is ready to be built.</p>",972
7,https://www.thesprucepets.com/speed-up-aquarium-cycle-1380707,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>How to Cycle A Fish Tank</h1>,"<h1>How to Cycle A Fish Tank</h1><p>Every new aquarium has to go through the tedious process of cycling. ""Cycling"" refers to establishing beneficial bacterial colonies that regulate the nitrogen cycle, the conversion of ammonia to nitrite, then to nitrate. There is no way to instantly establish the necessary stable nitrogen cycle in a new aquarium. However, if you take the time to properly set up your filtration, your fish will thrive in their new home. With all of the techniques described below, use a liquid-based test kit to make sure the water levels are where you expect them to be.</p><p>In order to protect your fish from a sudden water quality crash, always start by stocking your aquarium with only 10 to 20 percent of your final fish load. This will allow the beneficial bacteria to grow in the filter media without putting your fish at risk. Slowly add more fish over a few weeks to months, keeping a close eye on your water quality as you go.</p><p>Do you need to take steps to make sure your filter is established before you add fish? No. However, if you have filter media from an existing aquarium you can add some to your new aquarium filter to 'jump-start' your biofilter. If you start with a completely new filtration system and have no access to filter media from other systems, start with a low bioload and watch your water quality parameters carefully. Expect to see spikes in ammonia, nitrite and nitrate as your filter becomes established. By adding only 10 to 20 percent of your total fish load to start, your ammonia and nitrite spikes will not be deadly. Test your water quality regularly and get ready to do some extra water changes if your levels creep up too high. In four to six weeks, your tank will be cycled.</p><h2>Fish-less Cycling </h2><p>The benefit of this method is that no fish are required to be in the aquarium; therefore, no fish are at risk of being lost. Timing is very important when doing a fishless cycle. If you are ordering your fish online and not at a store, be sure to contact them to know exactly when your fish will arrive.</p><p>The key to a fish-less cycle is that YOU are responsible for adding ammonia to the aquarium to replicate the waste that would be produced by the fish. You must continually add ammonia to your system so your cultured bacteria do not die from a lack of nutrients. This can be done by adding ammonium chloride powder daily in small amounts and measuring the ammonia and nitrite levels. The ammonia will initially get higher, but as the beneficial bacteria start growing, the ammonia level will go down and the nitrite level will increase. When the nitrite level starts going down and the nitrate increases, then the aquarium has been 'cycled'. Once your filter is cycled, you will need to add fish slowly to keep the system going.</p><p>Fish-less cycling will not cycle the tank instantly. Just as the standard methods of establishing biological colonies in an aquarium take time, so does fish-less cycling. However, it is certainly easier on your fish.</p><h2>Using Pre-Established Media </h2><p>Also known as ""seeding an aquarium,"" using media from another pre-established filtration system is an age-old method for jump-starting the biological colonies in a new aquarium. Use a portion of the filter media from a previously established system or a cup of gravel from a stable, established tank in a mesh bag and put it into the filter. Transfer between systems should take place quickly, without allowing time for the bacteria to die or dry out. Unless you have a lot of filter media to spare, this method will shorten your cycling process, but will still take some time for your filter to reach full biological capacity.</p><p>However, not all bacteria colonies will work in different tanks. Do not use seed material from an aquarium that has dramatically different water parameters than the new tank. Test your water to make sure the pH (acid-base balance) and kH (alkalinity) are in a similar range. Like many fish, bacteria cannot withstand dramatic shifts in water chemistry. All fish will bring some of their own bacteria into the mix. The colonies you start out with might not be what you end up with. Keep a close eye on your nitrogen parameters to make sure things are progressing smoothly.</p><p>Never take filter media or substrate from an aquarium with fish showing any signs of disease. Even though most pathogens only live on fish, some can survive in the water or gravel and there is a chance that something might be lurking in the filter media.</p><h2>Dual Filters </h2><p>Another method to speed up the nitrogen cycling process is to place the filter that is to be used in the new aquarium on an already established aquarium and let it run side by side with the existing filtration system. This method will require some advanced planning on your part. As with the method above, make sure your fish are healthy and the aquariums have similar water chemistry parameters.</p><p>After 4-6 weeks, this matured filter can be moved to the new aquarium. Make sure everything is ready to go before you transfer the new filter! Don't forget to add a few fish so your filter has some ammonia to eat.</p><h2>Over-the-Counter Bacterial Products </h2><p>Many fish stores will sell you a bottle of bacteria to ""instantly"" start your filter. Provided that what is in the bottle is still viable, the chance that those bacteria colonies are what your fish need is slim. It still takes time for the beneficial bacteria to grow even if you add a commercial bacteria supplement to the new aquarium. Save yourself the money and take some time to start your filters correctly. Avoid the temptation of instant gratification and your fish will thank you.</p><p>Regardless of the cycling method used, there is no magic method to immediately establish fully functional biological colonies. You will need to plan accordingly and take your time. Test your water chemistry regularly until your filtration system is fully cycled and the water quality is stabilized.</p>",1013
8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-substrate-1380045,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Purpose and Types of Aquarium Substrate</h1>,"<h1>Purpose and Types of Aquarium Substrate</h1><p>With rare exception, aquariums are set up with some sort of substrate covering the tank bottom. The substrate is available in a variety of colors and materials, giving aquarium owners a wide range of options when setting up an aquarium. Because the substrate isn't as easy to change as other elements in the aquarium, it's wise to spend some time choosing the type and color of the substrate before setting up the tank.</p><h3>What is aquarium substrate?</h3><p>Aquarium substrate refers to the material used to cover the bottom of an aquarium tank. While it's sometimes chosen just for aesthetic purposes, choosing the right substrate for your specific needs can positively affect the quality of the water, environment, and influence the well-being of creatures within the aquarium.</p><h2>Purpose of Substrate </h2><p>The substrate serves several purposes. Some are key to a healthy habitat, while others are merely aesthetic. It provides color to enhance the theme of the aquarium, such as bright colors to go with a castle or mermaid theme for children's aquariums, to a more natural brown gravel to go with the decor of driftwood and live plants. Gravel also acts as a site for beneficial bacteria to grow that break down the waste products produced by the fish.</p><h2>Bacteria Medium </h2><p>The substrate serves a role in the nitrogen cycle by acting as a medium in which beneficial bacteria colonize and grow. Although the substrate is not the only host for these important bacteria, it is where a significant number of them reside. In addition to supporting bacterial colonies, the substrate is also a medium for live plants to take root and draw nutrients. Special substrates are available that provide key nutrients for use in aquariums with live plants.</p><h2>Fish Habitat </h2><p>Substrate creates a more natural habitat for the fish, and it's particularly important for fish that like to burrow. Bottom-dwelling species enjoy rooting in the substrate for tidbits of food that have fallen there. The substrate can also make fish feel safer, as it does not reflect images of the other fish in the tank, like glass can. The mottled color of the substrate also helps the fish to feel safe. Some species of fish scatter their eggs on the bottom of the tank. If the tank bottom is bare, the eggs are clearly visible and more likely to be consumed by adult fish. A mottled substrate will help make the eggs less noticeable. If the substrate is large enough, some eggs will fall in between the open spaces and be protected.</p><h2>Decoration </h2><p>Substrate contributes to the overall aesthetic appeal of an aquarium. When combined with plants, rocks, driftwood, and other decor, substrate helps create a visual landscape that is pleasing to the eye and provides a calming effect. A well-crafted aquarium is known to have a positive health benefit to those who gaze at it. Choosing a substrate color that complements your fish can help highlight their colors.</p><h2>Substrate Materials </h2><p>Substrate is available in a wide range of materials, but most aquarium owners choose standard gravel commonly sold at pet shops. Gravel comes in a variety of sizes, colors, and even shapes. Sand is probably the next most-used type of substrate. Fish that enjoy burrowing are particularly fond of sand substrate. Another common substrate is crushed coral, which has the effect of raising the pH and increasing the buffering capacity of the water. African cichlids, for example, need gravel that is high in calcium known as argonate to help regulate the pH of their tank.</p><p>Large river rock is sometimes used by itself or with gravel beneath it. The rock is attractive and makes for a natural setting. Marbles, on the other hand, are far from natural. However, they are often used when breeding egg-scattering species of fish. The eggs will fall between the marbles and out of reach of the adult fish, who would otherwise enjoy eating the tasty freshly laid eggs. Marbles are also used in Betta fish bowls, allowing for ease of maintenance.</p><p>If live plants are kept in the aquarium, it is common to use laterite or vermiculite as a substrate. These materials can store and release important nutrients for the live plants. They are usually used as a lower layer of the substrate and are covered with a layer of gravel.</p><h2>Substrate Quantity </h2><p>The substrate is generally filled to a depth of approximately 2 inches. Additional depth may be warranted when there are live plants that produce a robust root system and need the extra depth. When using sand, the depth usually is a bit less, between 1 and 1 1/2 inches. More than that can cause anaerobic zones in the gravel that are problematic. This is also true of gravel substrate that is filled too deeply.</p><h2>Substrate Color </h2><p>Color is a topic that often gives rise to heated discussions. Some feel strongly that substrate color should mimic natural habitats, while others choose a substrate color based on personal preference, including bright pink, neon blue, fire engine red, and a host of other colors. Clearly, those are not natural colors that fish experience in the wild, but it isn't going to directly harm the aquarium inhabitants.</p><p>If you do a good job of caring for the fish, the color of the substrate is a minor issue. Most fish are quite adaptable, and if kept in a well-maintained tank with proper water conditions and good food, they will do fine regardless of the substrate color.</p><h2>Substrate Maintenance </h2><p>Whatever choice of substrate you select for your aquarium, it is important to periodically remove the wastes that may accumulate in the substrate. The easiest way to do this is to use a special aquarium gravel vacuum that will suck up the debris from the substrate without removing the substrate itself. These are available at your local fish store and should be used about once or twice a month when doing the partial water change in your aquarium.</p>",1000
9,https://www.thesprucepets.com/getting-started-saltwater-aquariums-2925662,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>How to Set Up Your Saltwater Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How to Set Up Your Saltwater Aquarium </h1><p>Ready to get started with a saltwater aquarium? Great! Although setting up your first saltwater tank can be a little challenging, if you follow all the below steps, you and your fish will be happy for years to come!</p><h2>Step 1: Planning Your Tank</h2><p>Make a list of your desired species. Will they all get along and how much water will you need to make them happy? What substrate or decor would be preferred for your fish? Does your total volume of water fit into the space you desire? If you are limited in your space or design, you will need to rethink your fish species. Here are some of the best beginner saltwater fish to get you started.</p><p>If you can, make your tank a little bigger than you think you'll need. This will give you a buffer for any water chemistry mistakes during the setup process. Do skip this step and just ""wing it."" You are planning for living, breathing animals to live a long, happy life and they deserve some limited consideration.</p><h3>Do you want just fish or fish and corals?</h3><p>One of the big divides between marine tanks is fish-only and a fish and coral tank. If you are just getting started in saltwater, a fish-only tank is easier and can be expanded to include corals in the future with some minimal modifications. However, some fish just can't help nibbling corals and should never be included in coral tanks. The salt mix you choose will also vary depending if you need certain minerals and supplements for your corals, but not your fish.</p><h2>Step 2: Buy Your Materials</h2> <p>For more information on these individual components, read over our complete list.</p><h2>Step 3: Assemble Your Aquarium </h2><p>Once you have all the individual components, it's time to assemble,</p><p>Set your tank on its stand on a sturdy surface away from any indoor heating/cooling elements and away from external windows. This will help keep your tank at a consistent temperature and deter rogue algae growth. If you are not using a tank-specific stand, remember that water is A gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds. If you are unsure of your intended surface, stand on it and wiggle around. If you feel your table/counter/etc wobble at all, rethink your location.</p><p>The first time you mix your saltwater, you can do so directly in your tank. Fill your tank with your source water, which may take considerable time if you are starting with RO water, and add in the recommended amount of salt. Before you start to mix, you can add in your filtration components, including sumps, canister filters and powerheads to direct water flow. Also add your heater and get it set to the correct temperature; warm water will dissolve salt faster than cold water. Once these are setup and working, they will slowly start to dissolve the salt crystals.</p><p>Give your tank at least 8 hours to mix completely. Then, test your salinity with your hydrometer or refractometer and your temperature with your thermometer. If either parameter is off, make the necessary changes and check an hour later. If both are within the correct range, order your live rock and no more than 20 percent of your fish. Pick easy-going, non-aggressive fish to add first. Live rock will bring in the start of your nitrogen cycle, but your tank has to be 100 percent ready for it before you begin.</p><h2>Step 4: Adding Your Fish</h2><p>No matter where you order your fish from, try to buy captive-bred species. In doing so, you reduce the number of fish that are taken from their wild homes. If you are bringing fish in from multiple sources, you will need to quarantine them separately by vendor. This will limit the spread of disease between individuals. Captive-bred fish are known for carrying fewer diseases than wild-caught fish.</p><p>When you just start your aquarium, expect your tank to undergo a ""new tank syndrome"" in which your biological filtration has not been established. By starting with live rock, you will limit this effect on your fish. And starting with a low fish load will protect you against dangerous ammonia spikes.</p><h2>Step 5: Completing Your Tank</h2><p>Over the next 4 weeks, pay close attention to your water chemistry parameters, including ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, kH, gH, salinity and temperature. You may need to top off occasionally due to evaporation. Resist the urge to top off with saltwater and instead add heated freshwater. When water evaporates, it does not take any salt with it.</p><p>After your initial fish purchases have cleared quarantine, about four weeks for most fish, you can add them all to your main tank. Be sure to acclimate them properly unless the water chemistry parameters match exactly. You can re-purpose your quarantine tank(s) to slowly add your additional desired fish to your tank. Remember that fish need to separate fish by vendor in order to prevent disease spread. To make things easy for you, choose captive-bred fish from only one vendor to decrease the chances of disease spread. If you are adding any aggressive fish to your tank, be sure to add them last so the other fish have time to settle in.</p><h2>Step 6: Enjoy Your Tank</h2><p>All fish tanks are enjoyable, but few can argue against the beauty of a vibrant saltwater tank. Write out a manageable maintenance routine and post it on your calendar. If you are unable to maintain your system yourself, you may nee to hire a cleaning company. Watch your fish daily for any physical or behavioral signs of disease. This is easily accomplished during feeding time, when fish are at their most interactive. By providing your fish a healthy system and good diet, you will provide them a long life of happiness.</p>",952
10,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-air-pump-accessories-1380891,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Aquarium Air Pump Accessories</h1>,"<h1>Aquarium Air Pump Accessories</h1><p>Air pumps are widely used in aquariums to drive filters, air curtains, and other equipment. To effectively use an air pump, several accessories are useful. Those accessories may include a check valve, which should be considered mandatory with all air pumps, as well as airline tubing, gang valves, and pipe valves or T-connectors. This accessories primer explains how to use them and what to look for when choosing them. </p><h2>Pipe Valve</h2><p>Pipe, control, or T valves, are simply connectors that allow the tubing to be connected to various pieces of equipment. They can also be used in the event a piece of tubing develops a leak. The faulty portion of tubing can be removed and a pipe valve used to connect the two halves of the tubing, thus eliminating the need to replace the entire length of tubing and potentially having to disrupt the tank in the process. Pipe valves can also come with a valve lever to turn off or adjust the airflow, although gang valves are typically used to adjust the flow rate.</p><h2>Gang Valve</h2><p>Amazon</p><p>Gang valves are used to control airflow for multiple lines, although single-line gang valves are available. The gang valve is designed to adjust airflow in small increments or even shut it off entirely. Gang valves are designed to be mounted on the aquarium or stand and remain in a fixed position. Typical gang valves for aquarium use come with three or four ports, which don't all have to be used. Some models also come with check valves built into the system.</p><h2>Check Valve</h2><p>Amazon</p><p>Check valves are a must when using an aquarium air pump. They prevent a phenomenon known as back siphoning, which can have serious repercussions. Without a check valve on the airline tubing, if the air pump goes off, aquarium water can be sucked from the tank down the airline tubing, damaging the air pump, entering the electrical outlet resulting in dangerous shocks, and drain part or most of the water out of the aquarium. Nobody wants any of those things to occur in their home or aquarium, which is why every air pump should be fitted with a check valve in the line between the tank and the air pump.</p><p>Check valve design is simple and effective, and about the only thing that can be done incorrectly when installing them is to place them in the line backward. They come with an arrow or another mark to indicate which direction to place the valve in the line. The arrow should point in the direction of the airflow. When in doubt, blow through the check valve to verify which direction air will flow. Always keep extra check valves on hand, if one fails.</p><p>Most differences in check valves are largely cosmetic. They come in a variety of colors and shapes, but all accomplish the same thing. Often they will come in packages of three or more. Some check valves are combined with other functions, such as a CO<sub>2</sub>diffuser or bubble counter combined with a check valve. There are gang valves available with check valves combined in the design. Right angle check valves serve the dual purpose of routing airlines around a corner while providing check valve protection at the same time. There are even bubble wands with an integrated check valve.</p><h2>Airline Tubing</h2><p> Amazon</p><p>Size: Airline tubing is used with air pumps to connect to a variety of equipment, including filters, airstones, bubblers, and decorations. Tubing will often be provided with an air pump or air driven equipment, but it's not always the best fit for what is needed in your setup. Perhaps the most common problem is an insufficient length. When purchasing a piece of equipment, make sure you check the length of tubing provided, as often it's on the short side. Standard aquarium airline tubing inside diameter is usually 3/16 or 1/4 inch. Pond tubing is larger, so take care that you don't get the wrong diameter tubing for your aquarium.</p><p>Color: Another tubing factor to consider is color. Although clear tubing may seem like the only color you will ever need, it can be surprisingly visible in some cases. Clear tubing tends to catch the light, while tinted tubing has a matte finish that doesn't reflect light so readily. Depending on the setup, tinted tubing may be far easier to conceal next to colored equipment, cabinetry, or backgrounds. Tinted tubing can also be used in gang valves to give a quick and easy visual differentiation for which piece of equipment a line is going to. Black tubing has the added benefit of deterring algae growth in airlines. In addition to clear tubing, colors or tints commonly seen are pale blue, pale green and black. Some tubing comes with markers to indicate length, which can be handy when cutting to desired lengths.</p><p>Material: Lastly, the tubing material is another consideration. PVC (vinyl) and silicone are the most common types of aquarium airline tubing. PVC is generally stiffer and shinier than silicone. Silicone is highly flexible and has a matte finish that reflects light less than most PVC tubing. The stiffness of PVC is valuable in applications where the tubing needs to stand more rigidly in place, while the flexibility of silicone fits better when the tubing needs to bend around turns and corners.</p><p>When cutting airline tubing always cut them a bit longer than what you need, as you can always trim them later but you can't add length if the line is too short. Cutting the tubing at a slight angle will help when placing and removing the tubing from the equipment. Wet the nozzle of the fitting help the tubing slip on the fitting more readily. If using multiple airlines, mark each line with a magic marker to help to identify which one is which later on.</p>",959
11,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-aquascaping-5115235,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>What Is Aquascaping?</h1>,"<h1>What Is Aquascaping?</h1><p>Aquascaping is a niche in the aquarium world that is essentially underwater landscaping. Using live plants, mosses, wood, rock and other natural products, aquascape designs can be wondrous submerged creations. Fish or shrimp may be incorporated, but the main draw is that the aquascape aquarium mimics the natural landscape seen either above or below the water. It can represent forests, mountains, rivers, or any feature of a natural landscape.</p><h3>What is aquascaping?</h3><p>Often compared to gardening underwater, aquascaping is the act of designing and outfitting an aquarium with live plants. Hobbyists design their tanks using various plants and mosses, as well as hardscape materials such as sand, stone, and wood. Tanks that display aquascaping often also incorporate fish, however some hobbyists allow the greenery to take center stage alone. There may be only a few fish in the aquarium, and often just a school of a single species of fish.</p><h2>Types of Aquascaping </h2><p>There are four main styles or types of aquascaping.</p><h3>Iwagumi Style </h3><p>Also known as the Japanese Zen style, Iwagumi tanks are very minimal. Although they may look easy, capturing this simplistic style is harder than it looks. Minimal materials are used, and this style includes the use of three main stones. The largest, known as the Buddha, is accompanied by two smaller attending stones.</p><h3>Jungle Style </h3><p>This style of aquascape harnesses the natural growth of live plants. Rather than a structured or readily trimmed appearance, aquatic plants are allowed to grow throughout the tank without restriction. This style requires heavy plant research to understand which types will be suitable to incorporate into your design.</p><h3>Dutch Aquarium </h3><p>The Dutch Aquarium does not rely on any hard materials, such as stone or wood, and instead focuses on a wide variety of aquatic plants. With this style, it is critical to understand the overall shape, height, and texture of all varieties of live underwater plants.</p><h3>Nature Aquarium </h3><p>The Nature style attempts to capture or recreate a landscape or image of the natural world above ground. This style incorporates all available materials and has led to the development of underwater waterfalls, using sand instead of running water. This style is one of the most difficult since many layers need to fit together in harmony for a cohesive design.</p><h2>Common Aquascaping Equipment and Materials </h2><h3>Live Plants </h3><p>Live, aquatic plants are the centerpiece in all aquascape tanks. There are countless varieties of rooted and floating aquatic plants that can be incorporated into your aquascape design. Keep in mind that some plants thrive in different environments, so do your research thoroughly before settling on a final collection.</p><h3>Wood </h3><p>Driftwood is a common feature in aquascape tanks. However, not all wood can go underwater! Certain types of wood may leech tannins in the water, which may benefit some plants and fish, but not all. Tannins can directly impact your tank's kH and pH and the water quality may change over time as they are released from the wood.</p><h3>Stones or Sand </h3><p>Depending on the style of your aquascape, you may be incorporating stones or sand. Some aquascapes even feature waterfalls made out of sand (see Nature-style aquascaping, above). As with various types of wood, choose sand and rocks made for aquarium use. You can use found materials, but be sure to sanitize them properly and rinse them well to get rid of any dust prior to adding them to your system.</p><h3>Fish or Shrimp </h3><p>Unlike most other aquariums, live fish and/or shrimp and other invertebrates are a very minor component of aquascape setups. The focus of aquascapes are on the planted materials, not so much the live animals.</p><p>Many planted aquascapes designs will often incorporate additional fertilizers or a carbon dioxide system, which may not agree with many fish. If you really want to include fish, stick to small, hardy species that like to school. Invertebrates, such as shrimp, are also good additions.</p><h2>Aquascaping Design Principles </h2><p>The design principles for your aquarium depends on which type of style of aquascaping you attempt.</p><h3>Simplicity Is Your Friend </h3><p>Unless you are attempting the Jungle Style, most other aquascape tanks do best with a minimalist approach. Especially if you are just getting started in aquascaping, starting simple is much easier to attain and you can add to your design as your skill grows.</p><h3>Do Your Plant Research </h3><p>Even if you are going for a certain look, keep in mind that not all plants grow the same. Some have various growth rates, some prefer to float rather than be planted, and some grow horizontally rather than vertically. Doing your research in advance will make things easier down the road.</p><h3>Proportion and Rule of Thirds </h3><p>When getting started in aquascape, you don't have to make the whole tank a part of your design! Start with a small section of your tank and explore different styles. Many tanks will be easier to maintain with minimal elements and a specific design.</p><h2>Aquascaping Maintenance Requirements </h2><p>Your intended style will dictate how much maintenance is required. Jungle and Nature styles require less upkeep than Iwagumi and Dutch Aquariums. Minimal fish will keep your maintenance needs very low, which is why smaller schools of small fish are typically used. It can be very difficult to clean any deeper than superficially with heavily planted and aquascaped tanks.</p> <h2>Aquascaping Events </h2><p>Care to test your aquascaping skills? Well, you're in luck! There are many aquascaping competitions that are open to amateurs and aquascape appreciators alike.</p>",891
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-water-testing-1378802,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>How to Test the Water in Your Fish Tank</h1>,"<h1>How to Test the Water in Your Fish Tank</h1><p>Is aquarium water testing really necessary? In a word - yes!</p><p>In a newly set up aquarium, water testing is critical to avoid fish loss as ammonia and nitrite rapidly rise. In an established aquarium, water testing is important to ensure the continued health of your fish.</p><p>Test kits should be considered an important part of the operating expense associated with keeping an aquarium. If you cannot afford test kits or feel uncomfortable testing water yourself, check with your fish shop to see what they charge for doing water tests. Some offer free water testing, or at least one free test each month, or will quote you a flat fee for monthly testing. Compare their charges against the actual cost of test kits.</p><h2>Which Kits? </h2><p>Ammonia, pH, nitrite, and nitrate water test kits are by far the most integral to aquarium water upkeep. Hardness and alkalinity tests are useful to establish what your levels are, but don't warrant purchasing an entire kit for them unless you have special needs such as a planted tank. Phosphate is worth testing for if you have algae problems. All testing should be recorded in a log or journal so that you have a record of what is happening over time.</p><h2>Ammonia </h2><p>Ammonia will be elevated during the start-up cycle in a new tank, but can also be elevated in mature tanks if the water is not changed regularly, filters are not kept clean, if the tank is overstocked or overfed, or if medication is used that disrupts the biological cycle.</p><p>In an established aquarium, an ammonia test should be performed and recorded in a log once per week. Anytime you have sick fish, or a fish death, you should immediately test for ammonia. Any detectable amount of ammonia should be addressed swiftly, as it is extremely toxic to fish.</p><h2>pH </h2><p>The acid-base balance of the water, measured as pH, is the most frequent cause of fish stress, which can ultimately lead to fish loss. It is usually the most overlooked parameter. Fish cannot tolerate sudden changes in pH; even a change of 0.2 can result in stress or death if it occurs suddenly.</p><p>Know the pH of your fish shop's water, as well as your own, so you can help acclimate the new fish properly. Keep in mind that if you use tap water, it has dissolved gasses as a result of being under pressure. Let the tap water sit overnight before testing the pH.</p><p>The pH can, and will, change with time. Fish and plant waste, water evaporation, topping off the water, and water hardness will all contribute to changes in the pH. As a rule of thumb, pH in an established tank should be tested once a month, and any time there is a fish death or illness.</p><h2>Alkalinity </h2><p>Another factor that affects the pH is the buffering capability of your water. As aquariums age, the biological filter uses up the carbonate in the water, and the aquarium will lose its buffering capacity, resulting in rapid pH changes. If your water pH changes suddenly or drifts regularly over time, you should check the KH (Carbonate Hardness, or Alkalinity) of the water. Consult your local fish shop for KH testing, and for buffering compounds to increase the water alkalinity and stabilize the pH level.</p><h2>Nitrite </h2><p>During the startup of a new tank, nitrite levels will soar and can stress or kill fish. However, even after aquarium water is initially ""cycled,"" it is not unusual to go through mini-cycles from time to time. For that reason, include nitrite testing as part of your monthly testing routine. Any elevation in nitrite level is a red flag that indicates a problem brewing in the tank. If a fish is ill or dies, it's wise to test for nitrite to ensure it is not contributing to the problem. The only way to reduce elevated nitrate levels quickly is via water changes. Adding low levels of salt to the water - 1-3 teaspoons per gallon - will reduce the effects of nitrite toxicity.</p><h2>Nitrate </h2><p>Although nitrate is not as toxic as ammonia or nitrite, it must be monitored to avoid stressing the fish. Nitrate can also be a source of algae problems. Nitrate will rise over time and can only be eliminated via water changes. Monthly tests are important, particularly when breeding fish, as young fish are more sensitive to nitrate than adult fish. Test monthly and keep levels low to ensure a healthy tank.</p><h2>Phosphate </h2><p>Whenever anyone complains that they cannot win the battle against algae, high phosphate immediately comes to mind. Phosphate serves as a nutrient for algae, and elevated levels will certainly add to your algae woes.</p><p>Although it's rarely discussed, a leading cause of increased phosphate is dry fish food - particularly overfeeding with lower quality foods that are high in phosphate. If you have algae overgrowth, test for phosphate. There are filtering materials available that remove phosphate from the water, and they can be added into your filter media.</p><p>These are the most important water parameters that need to be tested: ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, hardness, alkalinity and possibly phosphate. But don't forget to check another important water parameter, the water temperature, as this is important to keep in the normal range for the species of fish in your aquarium! A digital or floating glass aquarium thermometer is an important part of your water testing equipment.</p>",908
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/amount-of-fish-and-aquarium-size-1378335,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Guidelines for Stocking Your Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>Guidelines for Stocking Your Aquarium</h1><p>Virtually every fish owner has gazed at their aquarium and wondered just how many fish can be put in there. Unfortunately, aquariums don't come with a stocking chart slapped on the side. As a result, many owners unwittingly overstock their tank, sometimes with a disastrous outcome. So how does a fish owner know how many fish they can keep? There are some factors to consider, as well as several methods for calculating safe stocking levels.</p><h2>One Inch Per Gallon </h2><p>The most widely known rule for stocking a tank is the one inch of fish per one or two gallons of water rule. While this type of calculation works as a rough estimate, it leaves plenty of room for error. The rule does not take into consideration, modern filtration systems, whether or not you have live plants/proper lighting, and just what kind of fish you wish to keep. Like people, fish are not all the same size and shape. Stocking a ten-gallon tank with ten inches of slender-shaped Zebra Danios is not the same as stocking it with ten inches of full-bodied Goldfish. Larger-bodied fish create far more waste and therefore require more water volume.</p><p>Fish also need room to swim, some more than others. Even though the numbers may look good on paper, in reality, the tank may be too small for the fish to move about normally. This is particularly true of active species, as well as schooling species.</p><p>This brings up another topic schooling fish should be kept in multiples, which means more space will be needed. Adding one or two schooling fish will only stress the fish and lead to a shortened lifespan.</p><p>Furthermore, the fish often are not fully grown when first brought home. The adorable little catfish that is scarcely an inch long today could reach a half foot in size when it grows up. The true adult size of the fish must be used in the calculation for tank stocking. Many owners, however, have no idea how old their fish is or how large it will grow to be. Before making any fish purchase, always research the fish in question to determine the actual adult size. Many pet shops will have signage on the tanks with information about the fish, including the adult size of the fish and what other types of fish they can be housed with.</p><p>Another place for error is assuming the size of the tank is equivalent to the number of gallons of water it holds. A ten-gallon tank filled with gravel, rocks, plants, and an assortment of decorations does not hold ten gallons of water. In reality, the water volume is often ten to fifteen percent less than the size of the tank.</p><p>While the one inch of fish per gallon rule is a reasonable yardstick, it has its flaws. To be safe, with big-bodied fish like goldfish and cichlids, one inch of fish per two gallons of water is a safer rule to go by.</p><h2>Surface Area </h2><p>The larger the surface area of the water, the greater the oxygen exchange, which in turn supports more fish. Therefore, the surface area of the water directly impacts how many fish can be kept in an aquarium. A tank that is tall and thin may hold the same number of gallons as a tank that is short and wide, yet they have vastly different surface areas.</p><p>Using the surface area rule, the shape difference between the tanks is taken into account. The surface area is calculated by multiplying the width times the length of the tank. Under the water surface area rule, the tank can be stocked with one inch of fish for every twelve square inches of surface area.</p><p>This calculation, however, has many of the same flaws as the one-inch rule. For instance, it was designed to assume the fish are relatively slender-bodied, which isn't always the case. If wide-bodied fish are kept in the tank, the calculation should be changed to one inch of fish for every twenty inches of surface area.</p><p>Like the one-inch rule, the surface area rule isn't perfect. Its primary advantage is that it takes into account unusually shaped aquariums.</p><h2>Pros and Cons </h2><p>As a general yardstick for normal situations, the one-inch rule works adequately and is very easy to calculate. If using it, always use net gallons of water, and take into account the adult size as well as the shape of the fish. If the aquarium is a non-standard size, the surface area rule will work better than the standard one-inch rule. In either case, always do your homework first and err on the side of going under the limit rather than over.</p><p>Do not fully stock the tank all at one time; no more than 25 percent of the total volume of fish should be introduced to the aquarium at one time. Fish wastes, which are toxic, are eliminated by colonies of beneficial bacteria. Those bacterial colonies need time to adjust to changes in the bio-load. By introducing fish a few at a time, the bacterial colonies have sufficient time to grow and take care of the toxins produced by the fish waste.</p><h2>Filtration Matters </h2><p>Lastly, be aware that filtration also plays a large part in how many fish your aquarium will support. Your filter should run four times the total volume of water in the tank through the filter each hour. That means a 10-gallon tank requires at a minimum a filter rated at 40 gallons per hour. If in doubt, go higher, as there is no danger of over-filtering your water.</p>",919
14,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-causes-high-ph-in-an-aquarium-5120493,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>What Causes High pH in an Aquarium?</h1>,"<h1>What Causes High pH in an Aquarium?</h1><h2>Causes and Solutions to High pH in Aquariums</h2><p>It's not something most of us think about on a daily basis, but almost all liquids, including water, are either acidic or basic, which is measured as a pH level but in aquariums or fish tanks, that pH level can have a huge impact on your fish and plants. High pH in aquariums happens, but there are ways to manage it.</p><h3>What is pH? </h3><h2>Why does the pH of aquariums matter? </h2><p>Hydrogen ions play many important roles in transport across membranes. In fish, this is critically important at the gill-water interface. Given that hydrogen is a positively charged ion, there are many potential bonding pairs which can interfere with ion transport. Disruption to this process can have severe consequences to the health of your fish if they are unable to offload waste from their blood.</p><p>Depending on the species, your fish may have a wide pH tolerance or a very narrow one. Many marine fish species are known for very small pH tolerances, whereas other fish, such as koi and goldfish, can tolerate a very wide pH range. Do your research thoroughly prior to bringing any species home and make sure your aquarium can accommodate their water quality preferences. Some fish species may not be kept in the same tank due to their incompatible pH tolerances. Examples of incompatible fish species are discus cichlids, which require soft water with low pH, that would not do well with African cichlids that require high pH and hard water.</p><h2>Common Causes of High pH </h2><p>Many biological processes can interfere with your aquarium's pH. Decreases in pH are more common, since more activity, including algae, fish and invertebrates, introduces more hydrogen ions into a solution.</p><p>Most of the time, high pH originates from your source water. The initial water pH will depend on your location and any filtration you have in your home. If you are using additives to manipulate your pH to accommodate certain fish species, it is critical that you do your own tests to determine dosage rather than rely on what the pH adjusting bottle prescribes, unless you are starting with RO water. Depending on the chemical makeup of your tap water, your buffering additives may react differently depending on what cations and anions are present in various concentrations. A simple test is easy using a known volume of water and a known weight, not volume, of your additive. Test your pH and kH prior to mixing and after. Now, based on your test in a known volume of water, you will know exactly how much to add to your aquarium to set your pH just right.</p><p>The second most common cause of high pH is lots of plant and/or algae activity. Plants and algae survive on the alternating processes of photosynthesis and respiration. Respiration in plants and algae occurs in the absence of sunlight and is the same as most aerobic organisms on earth. Summarized, cellular respiration uses oxygen and fuel to create energy or heat, carbon dioxide, and water. In the reverse, photosynthesis uses light energy to take carbon dioxide and water to make oxygen and fuel for the plants to survive. By removing the carbon dioxide from the environment, and not increasing the carbonate alkalinity, your pH can rise slowly or dramatically, given the total amount of plant life in your pond or aquarium.</p><p>Various substrates may also be leeching cations into your water and bringing up your pH. Be sure that you are using an appropriate substrate for your species and tank setup. A simple test can be done by soaking some substrate in a bucket of freshwater and measuring the change in pH.</p><h2>Solutions to Correct pH </h2><h3>Warning</h3><p>If the pH of your aquarium is wrong, DO NOT attempt to correct it quickly. pH changes must be made gradually so your fish can slowly acclimate to their new environment. Shifting the pH too quickly, either up or down, can potentially kill your fish. Changes should be no more than 0.3-0.5 pH units per day.</p><p>Resolving high pH requires correct identification of the originating cause. High pH in your starting source water may be resolved through heavy filtration or a water softener, in cases of high pH with concurrent high kH and/or gH. Bounding pH from heavy plant concentrations may be deduced from hourly pH checks during daylight hours. If your plant load is too heavy, the simple fix is to remove some of the plants or reduce the lighting. This is a common issue in many aquascape systems that focus on plants and not fish. And a leeching substrate can easily be swapped for a new one that does not change your water pH.</p><p>If you are sure your source water is correctly calibrated and your plants are not overwhelming your system, you may benefit from a more thorough evaluation of your water source. Many small levels of various cations and anions may significantly impact your final aquatic environment. Some cities or pet stores will offer free or low-cost water testing. Persistent issues are commonly resolved by installing a simple RO system. This filtration system will produce a pure water source with a neutral pH and limited kH/gH. From this starting point, you will need to correctly measure your additives to get your pH, kH (alkalinity) and gH (hardness) to the correct levels for your fish. Always weigh your additives, rather than measure by volume, in order to get the correct dose.</p>",908
15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/replacing-aquarium-gravel-1381097,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>How to Replace Aquarium Substrate</h1>,"<h1>How to Replace Aquarium Substrate</h1><p>Replacing aquarium gravel in an established tank is debated because of the potential impact on the bacterial colonies that neutralize wastes in the tank. Some feel that most beneficial bacteria live in the substrate, and therefore the gravel should be disturbed as little as possible. Others believe the lion's share of beneficial bacteria lives in the filter medium rather than the substrate.</p><h2>Where Does Bacteria Live? </h2><p>Beneficial bacteria live on many surfaces within the aquarium. Therefore removing anything, be it rocks, gravel, plastic plants, or the filter media, will have some impact on the bacterial colonies. Does that mean nothing can ever be removed from your aquarium? Certainly not!</p><p>Armed with a water test kit and the knowledge of what to look out for, you can successfully change your gravel to something more appealing to you as well as to your fish (blue gravel isn't the norm in nature your fish will probably enjoy the change to a more natural colored substrate).</p><h2>Planning Ahead </h2><p>To replace aquarium gravel, you should plan. A checklist of tasks and materials needed is a good idea to ensure all your bases are covered. See the checklists below.</p><p>Because changing gravel can be invasive, it's advisable to move the fish into a temporary holding tank. If you don't have a spare tank, purchase a 10-gallon tank. It only costs about $10 and can be used as a hospital or quarantine tank later. If you absolutely cannot afford a spare tank, the next option would be to use a clean 5-gallon bucket that has never had detergents or chemicals in it.</p><h2>Timing </h2><p>Time your gravel change day so that it is not immediately following a filter change or cleaning. This will allow the bacteria in the filter media to stabilize before you challenge them with changes. A few days before you plan to change the gravel, top off your tank completely. Test the water to ensure the ammonia and nitrite levels are zero. If they aren't zero, address that problem before attempting a gravel change.</p><p>On the day before the big change, do not feed your fish. This will cut down on the wastes produced in the holding tank (nothing in means little goes out). Also on the day before the gravel change, review your checklist to ensure you have everything you need.</p><h2>Set up Holding Tank </h2><p>Start the process by rinsing the new gravel until the rinse water runs clear. Then set up a holding tank as close to the main tank as possible. This will allow you to transfer the fish from one tank to the other readily. Next, temporarily turn off the filter in the main (29-gallon) tank. Perform the next few steps quickly, so the filter is only turned off for a short period.</p><p>Siphon off enough water from the main tank to fill the 10-gallon holding tank about two-thirds of the way full. Then remove any live plants, rocks, and other decorations from the main tank and put them in the holding tank. This will preserve the bacteria growing on the rocks, etc. However, if you have large items, you may not have room to put them in the holding tank. Keep in mind that you'll need room for the fish, which you are now ready to move from the main tank.</p><h2>Move Fish </h2><p>Quickly net the fish and move them to the holding tank. Because the water in the holding tank is from the original tank, you do not need to acclimate them they can be moved directly over. Once you have moved the fish, cover the holding tank so none of your finned friends can jump out. If you don't have a regular hood or cover for the holding tank, a newspaper or piece of cardboard will do. Add enough aged or treated water to the main tank to allow the filter to run, and then turn the filter back on.</p><p>Note: Don't fill the main tank, as you need space to move back the rocks, plants, and decorations. You are now ready to swap the gravel.</p><h2>Replace Gravel </h2><p>Scoop out the old gravel and place it into buckets. Once all the old gravel has been removed, vacuum any debris from the bottom of the tank then put the new gravel in. After the new gravel has been added, you can move your rocks, plants, and decorations from the holding tank back to the main tank. Lastly, move your fish from the holding tank back to the main tank.</p><p>Leave the lights off for the rest of the day, and add some stress coat to the water to help ease the stress on your fish. Feed the fish sparingly the first day, then normally after that. Although your gravel swap is done, it is important to monitor the water for ammonia and nitrite spikes. Odds are you'll have at least a small spike.</p><h2>After the Change </h2><p>Three days after the gravel change, test the water for ammonia. If it is zero, wait another three days and test again. If it is still zero, repeat the test after one week just to be on the safe side. If the test shows an ammonia spike, treat the tank as if it were a newly set up aquarium, which means frequent testing and water changes until the ammonia and nitrite levels fall to zero.</p>",890

In order to maintain a healthy fish environment, any fish owner is going to have to get wet. ""Self-sustaining"" aquariums may sound idyllic, but, unfortunately, due to their artificial nature, any fish tank will require at least maintenance. But there are ways that you can minimize how much time and effort your fish tank requires.</p><h2>Tank Setup </h2><p>Start out by designing your ideal tank setup. Do you want it to look a certain way? Fit in a certain spot? Feature a certain kind of fish? Pick one priority and stick to it. If you're looking at certain décor, size or space, you will need that to limit your fish selection. If you have a particular range of occupants in mind, be sure to do your research to see how much space they need, if they get along together both inter- and intraspecies, and what environment would best suit them.</p><h3>Could You Go Bigger? </h3><p>Once you pick your tank, décor and inhabitants, do you think you could increase the volume? Keep in mind that more water equals more weight on whatever surface you have chosen. However, more water will allow more flexibility in maintenance. Greater volume and fewer fish will keep your bio-load low and allow you to stretch a little longer between water changes.</p><h3>Filtration Is Key </h3><p>Most tank filters are marketed towards certain size tanks. You pick the one where your tank falls into range. But by choosing a filter that exceeds the capacity of your tank, you allow more water to be filtered, again, buying you some more flexibility in your maintenance routine. Too big a filter will push your fish around! Try for a filter that is one and a half times the size of your tank.</p><p>If you've already got a filter working, do you have room to add some another? Never remove a filter and replace it with a completely new one no matter what the packaging says! It will take up to four to six weeks before your filter is up and running.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>The bigger your tank, the more filtration you have and fewer fish, and the easier maintenance will be.</p><h2>Your Minimal Maintenance Routine </h2><h3>Rinse Your Filters </h3><p>The frequency in which you rinse your filters will depend on how many fish you have, how much they are fed and how much filtration your tank has. Don't wait until the flow slows to clean out your filter media. This will only increase the work your pump has to do, overload them and cause them to need to be replaced sooner. Remember, you never want your filter media to be pretty and sparkling clean. Good bacteria that support your nitrogen cycle live in your filter media and blasting them clean with chlorinated water will kill the colonies you worked so hard to grow.</p><p>Rinse your filter media in waste aquarium water or gently in treated tap water of the same temperature. A healthy filter will not be sparkling clean or odor-free. Rinse until the water runs through easily.</p><h3>Check Your Water Quality </h3><p>Once your system is established no new fish, food or equipment in the last three months your water parameters should follow a predictable cycle. Your water chemistry parameters will tell you all about the health of your aquarium. Buy a reliable, liquid-based test kit and practice with it a few times to be sure you are able to test correctly. Most of your maintenance will be determined by your nitrate levels. Nitrate is the end of your nitrogen cycle and is toxic to fish when it builds up. Individual species will have different tolerances to nitrate levels, so know in advance what levels your fish can handle.</p><p>Rinse your filter media in waste aquarium water or gently in treated tap water of the same temperature. A healthy filter will not be sparkling clean or odor-free. Rinse until the water runs through easily.</p><h3>Water Changes </h3><p>Since your nitrate has nowhere to go, unless you have a few live plants to assist, you will need to take some old water out and put new water back in. Keep in mind that you will need a lot of plants in order to make a significant impact in your nitrate readings. You will also need to trim plants of dead leaves on a regular basis or your recycled nitrates will turn back into ammonia.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Use your gravel siphon to get down into the crevices of your substrate to remove excess waste and other debris. Your captured waste water can be used to rinse filter media and is great houseplant/veggie garden food.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is hard to avoid all maintenance on an aquarium. ""Self-sufficient"" systems only exist in the wild where they have numerous trophic levels and environmental influences. For artificial aquarium environments, you will have to get a little bit wet in order to best take care of your aquatic pets. By taking a few extra steps at the beginning, you can save yourself lots of stress and wasted time, setting up a system you barely have to work on and can spend more time enjoying.</p><h2>Shopping List </h2><p>Before setting up your aquarium, determine which is more important: The size of your tank or the species you want. Once you decide, keep a basic shopping list on hand to make sure you have the bare essentials.</p>",891

It usually occurs when regular maintenance and water change routines are ignored. Nitrate is the end product of bacterial reduction of ammonia to nitrite and then to nitrate. The nitrate will accumulate in the aquarium water until it is assimilated by plants or removed by water changes.</p><p>In freshwater, nitrate is relatively nontoxic even at high levels (200 mg/L or more), but in saltwater aquariums, it can be a problem for marine invertebrates, so it should be kept at lower levels (below 20 mg/L). Some marine aquarium keepers are reluctant to perform regular water changes to lower the nitrate as they would then need to add more salt into the aquarium, and so they only top off the evaporated water with freshwater (as salt does not evaporate). This does not remove the nitrate but allows the nitrate to rise and can cause problems in the aquarium.</p><p>This nitrate reduction method is an instant nitrate reduction water change method. You can reduce nitrate quickly to zero with no ill or harmful effects to your established aquarium residents. In fact, the behavior of the tank inhabitants can improve greatly afterward. You may notice the fish will become more active, start eating better, and may display brighter colors within a few days.</p><h2>Important Considerations </h2><p>One important consideration before you start a massive (or any, for that matter) water change is to remember that you will also be changing the pH in your tank (probably upward). Before beginning this water change, it is wise to slowly adjust your tank water pH to where it will be when you are finished. You can adjust the pH upward with common baking soda or downward with one of the many products on the market to reduce the pH of aquarium water. This will prevent your tank critters from going through ""pH shock,"" which can be fatal to more sensitive tank critters.</p><p>This method was proven when an experiment was performed to test it. The test tank's nitrate was allowed to rise to a dangerously high level, literally off the scale, to observe the transitions the tank would go through. The experiment was successful. It allowed the testers to observe the formation of different algae.</p><p>The established aquarium residents survived, too; a 15-inch snowflake eel, various types of hermit crabs and snails, a few crabs, two colonies of zoanthids, some non-living corals, and some live rock. The testers even added a newly mated pair of coral-banded shrimp the day after the completion of the water change procedure with no problems at all.</p><h2>Rapid Nitrate Reduction Method </h2><p>Many people try to reduce their nitrate levels by performing a series of partial, 20 percent water changes. This will reduce your nitrate (or any other chemical substance) levels, but it is rather inefficient if the object is to reduce the levels to near zero in the shortest period of time as possible, with the least amount of water.</p><p>For example, if you reduce the level of water in the tank to 20 percent of normal and then refill the tank to a 40 percent level, you have already reduced your nitrate levels by half. If you then refill the tank to the 100 percent level, your nitrate levels will be 20 percent of the original level that you started at.</p><p>If, on the other hand, you reduce the 40 percent water level once more to 20 percent and then refill the tank, you will end up with a nitrate level of 10 percent of what you started with. Perform the 40 percent to 20 percent reduction once more, and you will end up with a nitrate level of 5 percent of what you started with. So, if you started out with a nitrate level of 100 parts per million and used this method, your 100 ppm nitrates would be reduced, in a short period of time, to five ppm, which is considered to be an acceptable level even for corals.</p><h2>Why It Is Safe </h2><p>Some people fear that the rapid reduction of nitrate would ""shock"" tank critters. This is an understandable concern, but under the circumstances, the rapid reduction of potentially harmful toxins in a tank is of the utmost importance.</p><p>For example, it would be like standing in a closed garage with a car engine running, filling the garage with carbon monoxide. Then imagine someone telling you not to open the garage door since the rapid reduction in carbon monoxide levels is more harmful than reducing the carbon monoxide levels by 20%. The scenario is the same. The fish and other tank inhabitants are swimming in a toxic substance that will kill based on exposure.</p><p>Of course, the best way to avoid the urgent need to have to reduce toxic nitrate levels is to follow a regular maintenance and water change routine. If you find you are in a position where everything you have tried does not seem to work and rising nitrate levels continue to be a problem, give this water change method a try.</p><p>You can be conservative while using this method, too. if you are concerned about ""shocking"" your tank inhabitants, you can always perform this process over a period of time (waiting a few days between each water change process) until the nitrate is reduced.</p>",875

Although all are suited for beginners, the following corals are great additions to any reef tank. Difficulty depends on what environment is best for the coral, the easy ones having a wide range of suitable environmental conditions, and if they are sensitive to having close neighbors or need to be kept separately.</p><h3>Coral Types Ranked by Difficulty (Easiest to Hardest) </h3><h2>Mushroom Corals (Actinodiscus spp.)</h2><p>Mushroom corals are one of the easiest beginner corals. They come in a variety of colors and grow very quickly. They can easily overtake more docile corals, so be sure you have enough space for them to spread out.</p><h2>Button Polyps (Zoanthus spp.) </h2><p>These small polyps, commonly called colony polyps, are frequently sold as a cluster on a rock or plug. Another easy keeper that grows readily and comes in many colors, some of these species are luminescent and glow under blue LEDs. Some can sting their close-by neighbors, so be sure to give them lots of room.</p><h2>Green Star Polyps (Briareum spp.) </h2><p>Green Star or Starburst Polyps grow in small bunches with elongated tentacles. This group is termed ""indestructible"" by many online forums, so once you add it to your tank, it will be hard to remove, but easily thrives.</p><h2>Waving Hand (Anthelia spp. & Xenia spp.) </h2><p>With called Thin Waving Hand Coral and called Thick Waving Hand Coral, these two genera are very similar in environmental requirements and temperament. tends to have thicker tendrils than , but both come in a small variety of colors and give your tank lots of movement from their waving.</p><h2>Pineapple Coral (Capnella spp.) </h2> <p>Although they don't quite resemble a pineapple, more a tiny, thick tree, Pineapple Corals are readily grown in captivity and give your décor some height. These soft corals are easy for beginners and do well in a variety of tank conditions.</p><h2>Finger Leather Corals, or Colt Coral (Sinularia spp.) </h2> <p>There are many types of colt corals available to reef keepers. These soft corals typically have a light tan body with brown polyps. They have protrusions that resemble fingers, giving them their other name of finger leather corals. These fingers can be very delicate, so be sure they have room to move.</p><h2>Toadstool Mushroom Coral (Sarcophyton spp.) </h2><p>There are many colors and varieties of Toadstool Mushroom Corals. This coral forms a base plate and a thick stalk with many small polyps extending upward. Some species may produce toxins that are irritating to any close neighbors, so be sure to give them some space.</p><h2>Bubble Coral (Physogrya spp.) </h2><p>Bubble coral, also known as grape coral or octobubble, is characterized by its large, round, bubble-shaped polyps. These polyps can be tan, purple or green and may look slightly different throughout the day. This coral does not like heavy water movement and is aggressive towards other nearby corals.</p><h2>Closed Brain Coral (Symphyllia spp.) </h2><p>A close relative of the well known brain coral, the closed brain coral does not typically form a large sphere in captivity, but rather grows in patches. These hardy corals come in a variety of colors and sizes and prefer moderate water flow and lighting. Without the right resources, their growth will be limited.</p><h2>Fox Corals (Nemenzophyllia spp.) </h2><p>The fox coral is easy to maintain and has a very peaceful temperament. Also known as a ridge coral, these corals have large pale polyps that expand beyond their body during the day to capture food. They do tend to be delicate, so be sure to put them in a proper place so their expansion does not dislodge them or get in the way of more aggressive corals.</p><h2>Jasmine Polyps (Knopia spp.) </h2><p>Also known as clove polyps, eight tentacle polyps or encrusting polyps, jasmine polyps can be brown to pink or green and have eight armed tentacles. Resembling the jasmine flower, it is an energetic and enchanting coral to easily add to your aquarium, but tends to be fussy regarding water flow and light requirements, and their delicate tentacles can be easily damaged.</p><h2>Lobed Brain Coral (Lobophyllia spp.) </h2><p>Very similar to the closed brain coral, the lobed brain coral typically has more individual polyps, but are just as easy going and come in a wide array of colors. They are easily cultured and frags are easy to add to any aquarium, but they have specific water flow and lighting requirements.</p><p>No matter which coral you decide to add to your marine aquarium, do your research before purchase to ensure you are buying the correct species for your aquarium and current collection of inhabitants. Remember, corals have specific water quality requirements, including the need for many trace minerals, and they are affected by light levels and water flow. Be sure to feed them properly; they are living animals and require food. It is always best to start with one of the easier species listed above before seriously investing in corals.</p>",830
19,https://www.thesprucepets.com/my-aquarium-has-finished-cycling-2924188,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>What to Do After Your Aquarium Has Finished Cycling</h1>,"<h1>What to Do After Your Aquarium Has Finished Cycling</h1><p>Once your new saltwater aquarium has reached the third and final phase of the nitrogen cycling process and completed establishing the biological filter, it's important to be patient, and move slowly in adding more fish. </p><p>The newly established nitrifying bacteria (, and ) that have developed need time to multiply. These bacteria are living entities that require oxygen to survive, and food (ammonia, which is primarily generated by waste from all things living in an aquarium). Living on the surfaces of everything in the aquarium, the larger their numbers, the better they are able to detoxify the wastes produced by the bio-load in the aquarium. However, when the bio-load ""exceeds"" the nitrifying bacteria population, ammonia will begin to increase in the aquarium again, and nitrite as well. Both ammonia and nitrite are toxic to your fish and other aquarium inhabitants.</p><p>Once your tank has completed its cycle, if you move too quickly in adding new livestock or overly disturbing your biological filter, you may experience a case of ""new tank syndrome,"" so proceed slowly at this point.</p><h2>Tidy up the System </h2><p>Once the ammonia and nitrite levels have dropped to zero at the end of the second phase of the nitrogen cycling process, it's time to tidy up the system and get it ready for some new livestock with a few ""light"" cleaning tasks.</p><p>Light is the keyword here. Remember, the newly grown nitrobacteria that have developed in the final phase of the nitrogen cycling process are an essential part of building your aquarium's biological filter base. These beneficial bacteria live on all surfaces in the aquarium, and as they mature and multiply, they are what keep your system in balance. At this stage you do not want to strip them away and weaken their numbers, so here's what can be done.</p><h2>Perform a Water Change </h2><p>In conjunction with tidying up the system once the ammonia and nitrite levels have dropped to zero, a water change can be performed. In the process of light siphon cleaning up the aquarium, old water is removed, and once done, you refill it with some new saltwater.</p><p>Doing a 20 percent to 25 percent water change at this point is beneficial for the following reasons.</p><p>Once the aquarium is cleaned up and refilled, it's time to rinse out any mechanical filtering materials, such as prefilter flosses, cartridges, sponges or pads. But don't clean them aggressively, as you don't want to lose the beneficial bacteria that grows on this media; just rinse off the solid debris that accumulates in the filter media.</p><p>Now let the filter system run for a few days to clean up the water. If at this point any prefiltering materials appear to be dirty, clean them again.</p><p>Tip: No water changes should be performed, or any ammonia destroying products added to the water while the tank is cycling, as this only delays and drags out the completion of the cycling process.</p><h2>Add Some New Livestock </h2><p>Once you have allowed the system to run for a few days after cleaning up the aquarium and doing a water change, test to see if the ammonia and nitrite levels are at zero, and the pH is correct. If any trace of ammonia or nitrite is still present, wait until they are gone before you add new livestock, and when all is ready, proceed, but only by adding a few things!</p><p>You don't want to overload the biofilter system. Otherwise, a spike in ammonia will likely occur. One or two primary diatom and macroalgae eating fish, such as Tangs, Angelfishes, and Blennies, as well as some snails, hermit crabs and other hardy tank janitors, are ideal additions at this point.</p><h2>Stabilize the System </h2><p>After you have added a few new additions to the aquarium, allow the system to run for several weeks to become stable before continuing.</p><p>This means you should test the water daily for traces of ammonia and nitrite after introducing the first new animals. The longer you let the system run before putting anything else new in, the better, because this allows the beneficial bacteria to mature and multiply, making the biological filter stronger.</p><p>When all looks good, go ahead and add a few more new livestock, as you did before.</p><h2>Establish a Regular Aquarium Maintenance Routine </h2><p>The key to keeping an aquarium in prime shape and having a happy fish or reef tank community is to take care of it on a regular basis.</p><p>Of course, there are some simple daily procedures that all aquarists should practice, but unfortunately, there is no set structure for doing other weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, or longer in between maintenance tasks. No two aquariums are set up or run the same, and everyone has an opinion as well as a reason for what, when, and how often any particular task should or may need to be performed.</p><p>We can provide you with some maintenance procedure guidelines, but only you can determine what and when certain things need to be done. As time progresses and your tank matures, you will come to know your system, and from this, you will develop a routine that fits your aquarium's individual maintenance care requirements.</p>",854
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/burying-aquarium-for-child-1381250,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Buying an Aquarium for a Child or Teen</h1>,"<h1>Buying an Aquarium for a Child or Teen</h1><p>If you are assisting a child or teenager with starting an aquarium, be sure to do your homework so they aren't set up for failure. Here's how to make the right choices.</p><p>Prior to shopping, make a checklist of things you need so you won't miss anything or purchase unnecessary items. Print off this checklist with recommendations for aquarium gift giving; it has everything you'll need on one list.</p><h2>Tank Selection </h2><p>For beginners, a 20-gallon tank or larger is ideal. If space or finances make that impossible, don't go smaller than 10 gallons and take care to select small, hardy fish. Also, be sure you have an appropriate aquarium stand for your aquarium. Water is heavy, and larger aquariums need strong support; they weigh more than a book case or cabinet can hold - you need a stand made for aquariums.</p><p>Should you select glass or acrylic? Acrylic has many advantages for children, since it does not chip or break, weighs less than glass, and doesn't distort the view as glass can. That's important, as children will spend a lot of time gazing at their tank from all angles.</p><p>On the downside, acrylic scratches easily and it is more expensive than glass. If the price is not an issue, strongly consider an acrylic tank. You won't have to worry about the tank being broken by an errant baseball or other flying toy.</p><h2>Decorations </h2><p>Children and teenagers often want brightly colored gravel and decorations. While this isn't the natural color of the habitat of the fish, it is still safe to use colored gravel. Just be sure it is specifically made to be used in aquariums. You can select decor based on the child's tastes. Mermaids, divers, dinosaurs, or castles, or more natural items like rocks and caves, or even sunken ships are available at the fish store that are made specifically for safe use in aquariums. While live plants are great for aquariums, they do take some care, and starting with vibrant plastic aquarium plants may be the easy way to add plants in your first aquarium,</p><h2>Buying Fish </h2><p>Now comes your biggest challenge, as new aquarium owners, young and old alike, want to get lots of fish as soon as possible. Fish should never be purchased on the same day as the tank. You want to take the aquarium home and set it up, get the filter and lights working, dechlorinate and aerate the water, and add beneficial bacteria starter before adding any fish. Install the aquarium heater and set it to the correct temperature, usually between 74-78 degrees F for tropical fish.</p><p>It's critical to set up the tank, let it run for a day or two to stabilize the water temperature and ensure everything is functioning properly before fish are added. Note: This initial waiting period is not the startup-cycle; that doesn't begin until fish are added. During the time you allow the tank to stabilize, sharing some basic facts about aquarium wastes will help eager children wait for their new fish.</p><p>After the aquarium is set up and running properly, then it is time to get a few fish. Adding too many fish too soon and overfeeding them are the biggest mistakes new owners make. You should only add 2-3 fish at a time into a new aquarium. Wait a week, test the water quality - or bring in a sample to your fish store to be tested - and if the water quality is good, then you can add a few more fish. You should spread out purchasing more fish for your new aquarium over the first 4-6 weeks.</p><h2>Educate and Plan </h2><p>Tell elementary age children that fish go to the bathroom in the water they live in, and wastes can harm the fish. Explain that special bacteria in the filter system and in the gravel get rid of those wastes, but the bacteria take several weeks to grow enough to do the job. While they are growing, it is important to only have a few fish in the tank and change the water often to get rid of the wastes.</p><p>Middle school and high school students are capable of understanding the nitrogen cycle as it occurs in an aquarium; take this opportunity to teach them about it. Too many aquarium owners are unaware of this critical process, and as a result, they lose fish by adding too many fish to soon, causing ammonia or nitrite toxicity.</p><p>Once your tank is ready for fish, talk about fish choices with your children. Avoid large or aggressive fish or those that are difficult to care for. Read aquarium books, magazines or online articles to learn about the different species of tropical fish, how big each fish gets, and which fish can live together. Decide on a few hardy starter fish to choose from before going to the store, then see what is available. Ask the store associate questions to learn more about the fish they have. Be sure to know how big each fish will get so you don't pick that will grow too big for the size of your aquarium.</p><p>Aquarium Water Quality: Nitrogen Cycle.</p>",853
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/is-gravel-necessary-1378752,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Why Do I Need Aquarium Gravel or Substrate?</h1>,"<h1>Why Do I Need Aquarium Gravel or Substrate?</h1><p>Aquarium gravel, or substrate, makes an aquarium more attractive, and it comes in a variety of colors and sizes, from tiny pebbles and sand to large river rocks. However, it also serves several important purposes beyond decoration, though there are some situations in which using a substrate isn't desirable.</p><h3>What is Aquarium Gravel?</h3><p>Aquarium gravel, or any other material placed on the bottom of the tank, is referred to as substrate. Beneficial bacteria reside in your aquarium's substrate and break down fish waste, leftover food, and plant debris to keep the water conditions healthy.</p><h2>Biological Filtration </h2><p>Perhaps the most important function aquarium gravel serves is as a home for good bacteria that provide biological filtration. The bacteria can live without a comfy gravel bed, but without the additional surface area gravel provides, they might not grow in sufficient quantities to keep the aquarium water safe for your fish.</p><p>If the tank is left with a bare bottom, it will be necessary to change the water more often to keep harmful waste from building up. But if the aquarium is heavily stocked with fish, even frequent water changes might not be enough to keep ammonia and nitrite low without adequate substrate for housing the beneficial bacteria that provide biological filtration.</p><h2>Fish Habitat </h2><p>Substrate is part of creating a pleasant habitat for your fish. It gives the fish especially those that like to burrow places to hide, and it provides enrichment for bottom-dwellers that prefer to forage through the substrate for bits of food. Plus, it helps to reduce reflections within the tank that can stress fish.</p><p>Substrate can also be used to improve the chemistry of the water. For instance, if your fish require hard water, limestone gravel or a coral substrate can help you achieve the correct hardness and alkalinity levels.</p><p>Moreover, substrate can provide a safe home for fish eggs. Larger-sized substrates allow eggs to drop out of reach of hungry fish that wouldn't hesitate to eat their own offspring. Likewise, the infusoria, or microscopic organisms, that might be harbored in the gravel bed are a good first food for newly hatched fish.</p><h2>Home for Live Plants </h2><p>If you have live plants, a substrate is critical and second only to lighting in keeping your plants alive. The proper substrate in planted tanks can ensure your plants root well and have their nutritional needs met.</p><p>Laterite and vermiculite are common substrates used in planted aquariums, as they store and release nutrients for the plants. They're usually used in combination with gravel. Furthermore, some aquarium plants with more substantial root systems require extra depth to the substrate, so take that into account when assembling your aquarium.</p><h2>Aesthetic Appeal </h2><p>You may not be able to see all the microscopic ways the substrate benefits your fish, but you'll definitely notice how it enhances the aquarium's overall aesthetic appeal. Besides adding a design feature to the tank, substrate traps waste and other materials that otherwise would float through the water. Try having a bare-bottomed tank for even a day, and you'll be amazed at how much ""junk"" appears on the bottom.</p><p>In addition to hiding undesirable materials, substrate shows off what you really want to see: the fish. For instance, a silver fish against bare glass doesn't stand out well. But look at it against a dark substrate, and suddenly all its features pop. Besides making viewing more fun, substrate in a contrasting color to the fish allows you to better observe any health issues or odd behavior in your fish.</p><h2>When Substrate Isn't Ideal </h2><p>There occasionally are situations in which substrate isn't necessary or even desirable.</p><p>The most common circumstance when you wouldn't use substrate is for a grow-out tank to hatch eggs and raise young fry. Grow-out aquariums must be kept scrupulously clean, requiring frequent water changes and prompt vacuuming of waste. Fry are so tiny that it is often difficult to distinguish them against a gravel substrate. Thus, it's easy to accidentally suck them up when vacuuming the substrate or changing the water.</p><p>Hospital tanks also often omit substrate, which can harbor pathogens that might linger and infect the next inhabitant. A bare-bottomed tank is a good way to avoid that possibility. For the same reason, some owners also choose to exclude substrate from quarantine tanks that are used to house newly arrived fish during the initial quarantine period before adding them into the main aquarium.</p><p>Finally, some people believe brightly colored gravel can stress fish, possibly because it looks nothing like their natural environment. Stress is a major contributor to a compromised immune system in fish, leaving them susceptible to disease, so you might want to err on the side of caution with a more natural substrate.</p><h2>Substrate Sources </h2><p>It is also best to use aquarium gravel that is specifically designed for use in fresh water or saltwater aquariums, rather than getting a substrate found in nature, which could carry parasites or unwanted organisms. Paint from artificially colored gravel can leach into the water, so make sure any product you use is completely non-toxic to fish.</p>",834
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/sponge-filters-1381207,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>When to Use Sponge Filters for Aquariums</h1>,"<h1>When to Use Sponge Filters for Aquariums</h1><p>Sponge filters have been around almost since aquarium-keeping began. However, many aquarium owners either have no idea what they are used for or don't know they exist at all. Although sponge filters aren't suitable for every tank, there are situations in which they are perfect. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes, as well as pore sizes, allowing them to be adapted to a variety of filtration needs. They can be powered by a number of methods, including air pumps, powerheads, or even another type of filter.</p><h3>What is a sponge filter?</h3><p>Sponge filters are a simple and cost effective means of filtering aquarium water. They provide mechanical filtration, and can lead to a better population of beneficial bacteria in your aquarium and therefore a more balanced aquatic ecosystem.</p><h2>Using Sponge Filters for Gentle Filtration </h2><p>Sponge filters are excellent when safe and gentle filtration is needed, such as in a fry tank where young fish could be sucked into the intake of standard filters. Fish species such as bettas that do not thrive in strong currents also benefit from sponge filters. Shrimp are another species that requires very gentle filtration rather than a strong intake that would suck them in. Sponge filters are also great for hospital tanks, where fish are often weak and not able to tolerate the stronger suction from a standard filter inlet.</p><h2>Sponge Filters for a New Aquarium </h2><p>Another use for sponge filters is to jump-start a new aquarium. A sponge filter can be run on a well-established aquarium for several weeks or months to establish biological colonies. Once the new aquarium is set up, the matured sponge can be placed in a bag of water and transferred directly to the new tank, thus maintaining the biologicals. This gives the new tank an immediate biological boost, which in turn benefits the fish in the new aquarium by reducing the ammonia and nitrite spikes experienced in a new tank. Some aquarium owners keep a mall sponge filter running all the time in one or more of their main tanks, so they are prepared to set up a new aquarium or an emergency tank.</p><h2>Pre-Filter Use </h2><p>Sponge filters work well as a pre-filter on the inlet of a canister filter. The sponge filters out a good deal of the larger particulate matter, which keeps the canister from clogging. It is far easier to clean or replace the sponge pre-filter often, rather than tearing apart the canister filter. Additional biological filtration is also provided this way, and the sponge is ready for use in setting up an emergency aquarium should the need arise.</p><p>When using sponge filters either with an air pump, powerhead, canister or another filter, keep in mind that multiple sponges may be used. This not only provides additional biological and mechanical filtering ability but has the added benefit of allowing maintenance to be staggered so not all sponges are disturbed at the same time. It also gives the owner an extra sponge or two to seed a new tank with, if desired.</p><h2>Downsides of Sponge Filters </h2><p>The biggest negative when using sponge filters is the complete lack of chemical filtration. Sponge filters have no means to include chemical media, which means they can only provide mechanical and biological filtration. Many experts believe that's not a negative, as they feel chemical filtration is not all that it's cracked up to be. Certainly, an aquarium that has robust mechanical and biological filtration has minimal need for chemical filtration.</p><p>Another obvious negative with sponge filtration is the fact that they are not aesthetically appealing. Who wants a big old sponge detracting from the attractiveness of their aquarium? However, if the placement is well planned for when setting up the aquarium, the appearance can be minimized considerably. This is especially true in a well-planted aquarium, which can conceal most of the equipment, including a sponge filter.</p><h2>Sponge Filter Maintenance </h2><p>Sponge filters are relatively easy to maintain. The key is simply to remember to perform the maintenance regularly. The best way to clean a sponge is to perform a water change and save some of the water that was just removed. Submerge the sponge in the used aquarium water, then gently squeeze and release the sponge several times to dislodge particulate matter that has collected. If this is done every few weeks, the sponge will never clog completely and will last a long time.</p><p>Sponge filters are often used in multiples, either with two inlets or simply by stacking one sponge on top of another. If there are multiple sponges, stagger the cleaning schedule, so they are not all done at the same time. This will lessen the impact on the biological colonies, and minimize the potential for ammonia or nitrite spikes after cleaning.</p>",786
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/double-tank-stands-good-or-bad-1380901,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Pros and Cons of Double Tank Stands</h1>,"<h1>Pros and Cons of Double Tank Stands</h1><p>Double aquarium stands have been on the market for some time, but just because they are available, does that mean they are a wise choice for an aquarium owner? The answer depends largely on factors within the owner's home. In some cases, it's a great way to have two tanks occupy the same space that one normally would, while in other cases it's a disaster waiting to happen.</p><h2>Saves Space </h2><p>There are certainly pros to having a double aquarium stand. At the top of the list is the space savings. With a double stand, you can keep two aquariums in the same floor space as a single tank would take. If you are like many fish lovers, there is never enough room for all the fish you want to keep. Having a second tank doubles the fish keeping options.</p><h2>Quarantine Tank </h2><p>Even if you aren't in need of more room for fish, there is still a good reason to have a second tank. Everyone should have a quarantine tank, but few people set aside space for it. When bringing new fish home, they should be separated for a period of time to verify they are healthy before adding them to the main tank. Likewise, when fish become ill, it's usually best to treat them in a separate tank. Having a quarantine tank ready to use is a perfect way to treat sick fish while not disturbing the main tank.</p><h2>Breeding Tank </h2><p>Breeding fish is fun but can be challenging in a community aquarium. Successful breeding depends on nutrition and environmental conditions. The optimal breeding conditions can be created in the breeding tank, and once the breeders have spawned, they can be moved back to the main tank. The fry can then be reared in the breeding tank, with no danger of being eaten by the adult fish. It's a win-win situation all around.</p><h2>Aging Water </h2><p>Last but not least, if not using the second tank for fish, it can be used to age water. Set the tank up with a filter and heater, fill it with water, treat it, and let it run. When it comes time to perform a water change on the main tank, use water from the second tank. It will make water change time less stressful for both you and your fish. After changing the water in the main tank, simply fill the secondary tank and you will be ready for the next water change. Meanwhile, you have a tank up and running at all times for quarantine purposes.</p><h2>Double Tank Negatives </h2><p>Of course, there is a downside to using a double tank stand. One of the biggest negatives is the fact that the second tank is rather cramped at the top, making maintenance challenging. Large items, as well as larger fish, cannot be easily moved in and out of the lower tank. Viewing the lower tank is not as enjoyable as the upper tank because one must either bend over or sit on the floor. However, the lower tank is at the perfect height for viewing by small children, which brings up another potential negative.</p><p>Children and pets can easily access the lower tank, which has the potential for a variety of problems. It's hard enough to keep small hands or curious pets paws out of an aquarium when it is at a higher level. Move the tank down to nearly floor level, and problems are sure to follow.</p><p>Another problem with a double tank stand that few people think of is the weight issue. The floor may be strong enough to hold the weight of one filled tank, but two filled tanks in the same space could be too much in some locations. This is particularly true with larger tank sizes. Ten-gallon tanks are not likely to be a problem anywhere, but two 75-gallon tanks are a different matter. Combined, they can weigh upwards of a whopping 1,700 pounds when both are filled, all of that weight resting on a mere 49-inch-by-19-inch space. Always estimate the total weight and verify your floor can handle it.</p><p>Lastly, the lower tank is more likely to be exposed to drafts and cooler air temperatures than the upper tank. This can be offset with a heater but should be kept in mind when using a double tank stand. If you are keeping fish in both tanks, you may want to consider keeping coldwater fish in the lower tank. Then you need not worry about them getting too chilly, especially if you live in northern climates where temperatures get low in the winter months.</p><p>Management of Fish. . </p>",767
24,https://www.thesprucepets.com/before-buying-aquarium-1380710,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>What to Know Before Buying an Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>What to Know Before Buying an Aquarium</h1><p>All too often new aquarium owners have a bad first experience with their new aquarium and give up almost before they get started. Considering the basic factors described below and planning before your purchase will help new aquarium owners avoid common pitfalls. Even for the experienced aquarium owner, planning is a good idea. Two of the most important and basic issues to consider when setting up a new aquarium are cost and size. In both cases, people usually underestimate what is needed, and may make compromises that cause problems later.</p><h2>Cost </h2><p>Potential aquarium owners often see the price tag on a special package deal and assume they can get started for a few dollars. Don't be fooled into thinking you'll get started in the hobby for fifty dollars or less. Realistically it will cost $150 to $200 to get a twenty-gallon aquarium with decent equipment. If that investment is too steep for your budget, it is wise to save until the funds are available to get everything you need. A good way to start is to make a checklist of what you need.</p><h2>Make a Checklist </h2><p>Expenses include the tank and stand, hood and light, heater, thermometer, filter, gravel, decorations, water treatment, water test kit, net, and cleaning supplies. All that in addition to the fish, as well as their food. Make a thorough checklist and go online or to a pet store, then write down the costs for all the items you are interested in. Sit down and determine what your bottom line cost is before you make your decision. You may be surprised to see the actual total cost.</p><p>If your budget is very tight, another option is to ask for help. Take your checklist of what you need and let your friends and family know that you'd like items from that list for your birthday, graduation, or as a holiday gift. That way you can get started without having to opt for inferior equipment, and your family can get you something they know you want. Maybe they will surprise you and give you the items without waiting for a special occasion.</p><p>Another option is to look for used equipment. Be aware that used tanks may leak, and heaters or filters may not work at all, and it's difficult to test them out before buying. So, ask questions upfront, and don't pay more than 50 percent of the original price for anything used. Don't be too afraid of dirty glass or decorations, as that can be easily cleaned. However, scratches and cracks cannot be rectified, so check used equipment closely for damage.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>Avoid tanks under 10 gallons if you are a first-time aquarium owner. Small aquariums are far more difficult to manage than larger ones, as toxins can build up very quickly in the small volume of water. Temperature changes and water chemistry changes can also occur very quickly when there are fewer gallons of water.</p><p>A must to avoid are those cute mini-aquariums that range from two to five gallons. Although some of the package deals in tiny aquariums may seem reasonably priced, they are not good for the first-time aquarium owner. If at all possible, go with a 20 gallon or larger tank. You'll have a much better chance of making it work, as a larger tank is more forgiving of errors you might make.</p><h2>Consider Weight </h2><p>Be aware that an aquarium larger than 15 gallons will weigh more than 200 hundred pounds when filled, and should be placed on a stand rather than a shelf or desk. You'll also need a place to put the aquarium that is not in direct sunlight or be subjected to drafts or temperature extremes that could harm the fish.</p><p>The location must also be capable of getting wet from time to time. Performing maintenance, adding or removing fish and other items from the tank will splash water around the aquarium. Keep that in mind if you are thinking about keeping a tank on your desktop or over a shelf of books or other items that might get wet.</p><h2>Number of Fish </h2><p>Lastly, be realistic about the size and number of fish you wish to keep. They will determine the size of the aquarium needed, which ultimately impacts the space you'll need to accommodate it. Even if you choose a larger tank, start with a few small easy to care for fish. As you gain experience, you can add more challenging fish.</p><p>In short, when first starting out, think big for tank size and small for numbers of fish. Plan before purchasing equipment or fish, and you'll have a good chance of success.</p>",760
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/old-tank-syndrome-1381225,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>What Is Old Tank Syndrome?</h1>,"<h1>What Is Old Tank Syndrome?</h1><p>Old Tank Syndrome is a condition in which the aquarium environment had degraded over time, specifically the water chemistry. This water quality deterioration can have a devastating effect on your fish and even cause sudden deaths. Aside from some cases of algae overgrowth, there are generally few visible indications of the significant changes that have occurred in the water parameters. However, water tests will show a different picture.</p><h2>Signs and Symptoms </h2><p>Nitrate and phosphate levels will be significantly increased. The pH and kH (carbonate hardness) will be quite low compared to that of the water supply, while the GH (general hardness) often is increased. Generally, the pH will become more and more acidic over time. A falling pH in the aquarium water is often a sign of old tank syndrome.</p><p>Owners may assume all is well, because their fish are still alive, or at least most of them are. However, when new fish are added they usually die within a short time. The deaths may be blamed on the fish, rather than the underlying water problem of old tank syndrome. Some owners may have a clue that something is wrong at this point, and perform a massive cleanup. The result is usually the death of even more fish. Why? Because the fish have been suddenly subjected to rapidly changing water conditions.</p><h2>Causes </h2><p>Although the filter will remove most waste particles from the water, the waste is still there trapped in the filter until you clean it out. The same is true of toxic chemicals, such as ammonia and nitrite. Yes, beneficial bacteria will convert them to a less toxic form. However, the byproducts of that conversion process are other chemicals that are not healthy for fish at high levels. Remember, everything stays in the tank until you remove it.</p><p>Because all of this happens slowly, the fishes in the aquarium have time to adapt to the changes in the water chemistry. The weaker ones often die, but the stronger ones survive, although they are more susceptible to disease and will usually have shorter lifespans. Any newly added fish are likely to perish quickly, as they cannot adjust to the poor water chemistry.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Slow and steady are the keywords for correcting old tank syndrome. Don't make any sudden massive water changes. The tank may be clean, but the fish will all be dead. Instead, perform smaller, daily water changes of 10 percent to 15 percent until the water parameters are all back to normal. Monitor the ammonia and pH closely, testing on a daily basis initially. If the ammonia should rapidly increase, skip the water changes for a couple of days and add an ammonia-reducing product. Test the nitrate levels weekly to determine if they are dropping to normal levels, as expected.</p><p>As the water parameters improve, the filter media can be changed/cleaned, as well as the tank itself. Again, testing the water is important to ensure that the water chemistry is not dramatically changing too quickly. The end goal is to have zero ammonia and nitrite, low nitrate, and a pH and alkalinity that are close to the original water source, whether that is tap water or specially prepared water. Too sudden of changes in pH can affect the health of the fish, so increasing it by 0.3 units per day is ideal. If the alkalinity is too low, the pH will also stay in the lower range.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>Preventing old tank syndrome is a far better approach than allowing things to crash and trying to correct them later. Filter maintenance, water changes and water testing should be done on a regular schedule, rather than only when a problem occurs. Water changes should occur weekly, usually 10 percent to 15 percent, unless the aquarium is heavily stocked and then more water is changed. Filter maintenance should be performed monthly, along with cleaning the inside of the tank. Debris, such as excess food particles, should be removed promptly from the tank at the time it occurs. Cleaning is not enough, though. Water tests are key to keeping on top of potential problems.</p><p>If performed faithfully, a monthly testing cycle is sufficient. Be sure to log your results so you can easily compare them to prior tests to see if a pattern of change is emerging.</p><p>If the pH decreases, or if you see any of the other parameters changing from normal values, you should step up your cleaning and water change schedule. With good maintenance and careful observation, you may never have to suffer the scourge of old tank syndrome.</p>",755
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/diy-glass-aquarium-building-tips-2924663,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>Build Your Own Glass Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>Build Your Own Glass Aquarium</h1><p>Whether you're a fan of DIY or simply require a custom-sized aquarium, building your own glass aquarium is pretty straightforward.</p><p>The only difference in building a larger tank compared to a smaller one, of say 55 gallons or less in size, is that the bonding process must be near perfect, and the glass thickness must be sufficient to withstand the added water pressure with a margin of error for the unexpected (such as bumps or external impact). Using glass that is too thick means you are spending money you do not need to and too thin means spending sleepless nights listening for the telltale sounds of cracking glass and running water.</p><h2>Select Glass Quality and Thickness </h2><p>The quality of glass is determined by the individual manufacturer's methods and techniques for producing the glass. Testing samples show that the tensile strength runs from 19.3 to 28.4 megapascals (measures pressure forces).</p><p>Due to limitations in the glass manufacturing process, the strength of glass can vary, which means a suitable safety factor must be used when calculating glass thickness. The commonly used factor is 3.8. This is not an absolute guarantee, however; it will essentially remove all risk of glass failure other than that created by the damaged or very poor quality glass. Scratches and chips in the glass will be the main cause of failure.</p><p>You can use the DIY custom aquarium glass thickness chart to get a quick idea of which glass thickness will be required for your tank. You may think that the 3.8 safety factor is overkill for your particular tank and location situation (for example, low traffic in a protected area) and might even opt for a lower factor. However, it is better to be safe than sorry.</p><h2>Economize on Construction </h2><p>Another way to save on glass thickness is to design your tank stand so that it fully supports the entire bottom of the tank by using a styrofoam or polystyrene pad between the tank and stand. The pad will keep the tank from failing due to a point load on the glass surface, which can be caused by dirt or grit on the stand surface. If the tank bottom is fully supported, you can also use a thinner-than-normal piece of glass for the tank bottom since the stand will be adding strength and support and keep the glass from bending.</p><p>Another trick is to compute the required thickness for the end pieces of your tank. In all likelihood, the required thickness will be less than the longer front and rear pieces of glass.</p><h2>Apply the Silicone Carefully </h2><p>Glass preparation and proper installation of the panels is important when you are building your do-it-yourself aquarium, but more so when constructing a larger-sized tank.</p><p>When applying silicone on the glass, run a continuous 1/4-inch bead with no gaps or bubbles. For the best bonding results, apply only as much silicone as you can work within three to five minutes because after this the silicone tends to skin over and will not bond well to the glass.</p><p>Lay down a bead of silicone on the bottom glass for the rear and one side glass panel and on one side edge of the back panel, installing the back glass panel on the bottom, and then the side panel to the bottom and rear panel.</p><p>When any section to be joined has been set into place, the silicone needs to be smoothed out. This is done by starting at one end of a joined section, pressing the tip of an index finger down into the silicone, then firmly and evenly, without lifting your finger, and running it along the full length of the silicone joint at a slight angle. Secure the joined section into place with duct tape. Do not worry about wiping away any excess silicone that squeezes out from around your finger. It can be cleaned up or trimmed off once the silicone has fully cured.</p><p>The supporting surface of the tank base must be very level. On very large aquariums this can be difficult to achieve, and self-leveling filler may be needed between the polystyrene and the base. This should be applied just prior to fitting the aquarium to the base so that the aquarium's weight levels out imperfections. Sufficient time must be allowed for the filler to level and fully cure before the aquarium is filled with water. Follow the directions on the label of your filler product.</p>",735

This DIY aquarium stand might be just the ticket for you. This stand is much simpler and less expensive to build than to it is buy a fancy aquarium cabinet.<br/></p><p>The aquarium stand (similar to the 48"" stand pictured above) was built for a 20 gallon reef aquarium to be placed in the client's kitchen. She planned to stain the stand to match the trim in her kitchen after she took it home. The client planned to install an LED aquarium canopy or a glass canopy and an LED light strip for lighting.</p><p>Below are the materials and steps to building your own aquarium stand.</p><h2>DIY Simple Aquarium Stand Plans </h2><p>This aquarium stand is constructed of 2x4 lumber, for the price, one of the strongest and most economical pieces of wood you can buy at almost any home improvement center.</p><h2>Construction and Material Considerations </h2><p>We found that an elevated flat, level surface (i.e. a work bench, desk or table) was the easiest platform to use for cutting, drilling and assembling the aquarium stand. A pair of saw horses would work well for assembling and painting.</p><p>8' wood studs were purchased for the construction of stands from 10 gallon to 55 gallon aquariums. 4 studs were required for a 24"" or 30"" tank, and 5 studs were required for 36"" or 48"" tanks. The height of the legs for each of these stands was the ""standard 28"". When you are picking out your pieces of lumber for this stand don't be tempted to choose the cheaper, low grade stuff. Use only pieces that are straight (not warped) with no open knots and an attractive grain (if you are going to stain the stand). This lumber may be a dollar or so more per piece, but the elimination of a number of headaches and quality of the end product will be well worth it.</p><h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><h3>Prepare Materials </h3><p>Measure and mark the lumber for all of the pieces that you are going to cut. Measuring all of the pieces before cutting any of them will ensure that you have used the material efficiently. Measuring each piece twice before cutting will help to make sure that you have not made any mistakes. Measuring and marking accurately will help you to make sure that the stand will not wobble when it is assembled. Even 1/8"" difference in the length of one leg will make a big difference in the aquarium stability.<br/></p><p>Sand each piece of lumber before assembling. If you are going to paint the stand a light sanding to take off the ""fuzz"" on the lumber will suffice. If you are going to stain the material a better job of sanding will produce the best result. Most people find that staining the pieces before assembly also gives the best result.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>When measuring and marking the lumber, keep an eye on where the flaws are in the lumber. You don't want to cut a piece in such a way that you will be drilling a screw pilot hole through a knot. This will make installing the screws much easier.</p><h3>Measure the Legs </h3><p>Drill screw pilot holes in the deck 2x4's and the cross bar 2x4's (see photo for locations). Note: When drilling the pilot holes in the front and rear bottom deck pieces, drill them slightly farther from the ends and angle them towards the legs. This will make screwing the screws in easier as the legs may get in the way of the electric drill motor. Countersink the holes with the larger drill bit to a depth of about 1/4"".</p><p>Measure down 1 1/2"" from the tops of the legs and, using a square, draw a line across each leg (bottom 2 pieces of wood in the photo). This will be the top of where the upper cross bars are attached. Measure up 6"" from the bottom of each leg and draw a line, using a square. This will be the top of where the bottom cross bars are attached.</p><h3>Assemble the Legs </h3><h3>Finish Assembly </h3><p>Your aquarium stand is now complete and ready to paint.</p>",716
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/diy-do-it-yourself-aquarium-chiller-2924600,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>How to Build Your Own Aquarium Chiller</h1>,"<h1>How to Build Your Own Aquarium Chiller</h1><p>Some reef aquariums require water temperatures cooler than typical room temperature. Having water from the aquarium sump or filter pumped into a chiller, then returned to the aquarium can bring the water down to the desired temperature. You can make your own aquarium chiller with these plans from Don Carner. This is a quick and inexpensive method for maintaining a steady aquarium temperature, especially during those long hot summer months.</p><h2>Cost Considerations </h2> <p>A reasonable estimate is $200 once completed, which is still significantly cheaper than a commercial unit ($400 and up). While not as efficient as commercial chillers, this is a viable alternative and will decrease your water temperature surprisingly well. Use a pre-set or variable heater to balance the temperature within the sump and it'll become hands-free.</p><h2>Emergency Chiller </h2><p>If you just need a temporary emergency chiller to help keep your tank temperatures down for a few days, substitute an ice chest (even one of those inexpensive styrofoam ones will do) for the dorm-sized refrigerator and fill it with ice. Drop the tubing coil in it and you are ready to start chilling.</p><h2>Chiller Diagram and Instructions </h2> <h2>What You'll Need</h2><h3>Equipment / Tools</h3><h3>Materials</h3><h2>Instructions</h2><p>If possible, remove the metal box that isolates the ice cube tray/freezer section, but leave the temp probe alone. This will give a better overall temperature control within the cooling box.</p><p>The more coils, the better the temperature-reducing effect and the more efficient the unit operates. Depending on the brand/model of the refrigerator that you are using, you may encounter insulation between the housing and the inner box when drilling your input/output holes. There is no need to seal the refrigerator door. You might need access if something goes wrong down the road. Besides, it's a great place to keep your additives that require refrigeration after opening them.</p><h3>Drill Access Holes </h3><p>Drill your access holes in the top or sides, it doesn't matter.</p><h3>Cut PVC Pipe </h3><p>Cut two pieces of the PVC pipe about 4 inches each.</p><h3>Insert Pipe </h3><p>Insert through the holes drilled and seal very well with the silicone.</p><h3>Reinforce Pipes </h3><p>You may want to reinforce these pipes with a little five-minute epoxy before sealing them with the silicone. This keeps them from sliding back and forth and breaking the cured silicone seal should you want to move the fridge down the road.</p><h3>Glue Fittings </h3><p>Glue or thread your fittings onto these two access pipes. You can use nylon threaded nipples to connect the 3/8 inch tubing coils inside the cooling box. Outside, you can glue slip fittings reduced to accommodate the tubing running from the Rio 2500 sump pump to the chiller and back to the sump.</p><p>That's all there is to it. Remember that the more coils inside the refrigerator, the better your cooling effect will be.</p><h2>Using the Chiller </h2><p>Set the chiller as close to the sump or aquarium cabinet as possible. The further the run of plastic tubing from your sump to the chiller and back, the greater the temperature change due to ambient room temperature. You could use pipe insulation wrapped around the tubes, but this is rather unsightly and not necessary unless living in a very hot environment.</p><p>The operation is straightforward. Remember to keep the flow fast enough to prevent freezing of the water in the coils inside the box. If equipped with a thermostat, your fridge/chiller will be easier to control. Some models only allow you to set the main box temperature, not the freezer compartment. That's another reason for removing the aluminum ice cube divider and tray. The probe that is attached to the wall of the freezer area will now monitor the entire cavity. Set the refrigerator thermostat to the level that maintains the chilled water at the appropriate temperature to keep the aquarium temperature constant.</p><p>Try to use opaque tubing to eliminate algae growth in the tubes running from the sump to the unit and back. You will probably get the black algae, not the bright green algae that you see in and around the lighting canopy. Using the milky-white, semi-transparent hard, plastic tubing resulted in this build-up after six months or so.</p>",673

Responsible for removing dirty, unwanted substances from the water, these pieces of material are essential to maintaining healthy water quality in your fish tank.</p><h3>What is aquarium filter media?</h3><p>Any materials you place in your canister filter to change the quality of the water are considered aquarium filter media. Filter media is composed of several different layers that clean the water as it passes through before flowing back into the tank.</p><p>Various types of filter media can be installed in your aquarium. The conditions in your specific tank will dictate which types of filter media you will need, along with the correct order to pack them in. The general guideline is based on removing ever-decreasing particle sizes while still maintaining the health of beneficial bacteria.</p><p>You can experiment with combining different media, but maintaining a standard overall order will achieve the best water filtration. Here, learn the basics to determine the best components of filter media for your aquarium.</p><h2>Mechanical Media </h2><p>Mechanical filter media should be packed in first so that it receives the flow of raw water. All water should come in contact with this mesh part of the filter before it reaches any biological or chemical filter media. Mechanical media is intended to remove larger particles from the water, thus eliminating clogging in other areas of the filter. Placing it first in line allows much of the debris to be captured before the water continues on to the other filter media.</p><p>Types of mechanical filtration media include filter wool or floss, bonded pads, or sponges. While some of these can also serve a dual purpose as biological media, it is important to remember that any mechanical filter media must be removed and replaced frequently, so some bacterial colonies will be lost.</p><h2>Optional Dual-Purpose Media </h2><p>Some owners prefer to use sponges and pads material as both mechanical and biological media. When dual-purpose media is used, you need several layers, preferably of differing degrees of coarseness. The coarsest material is placed first.</p><p>Because the sponges are serving as both mechanical and biological media, each layer should be cleaned at different times. By staggering the cleaning schedule, they will have time to repopulate the cleaned zones. This way, there is less overall disruption to the bacterial colonies.</p><h2>Biological Media </h2><p>Biological media (bio-media) is usually placed after the mechanical media but before any chemical media. The biological media must not become clogged, as it serves as the right substrate for colonies of beneficial bacteria. If clogged, the oxygen flow will be impeded, putting the bacterial colonies at risk of die-off.</p><p>Biological filtration media are like condominiums for bacteria. Types include ceramic rings, sponges, pads, bio balls and bio stars, sand, and gravel. Keep in mind that some of these materials can also be used as mechanical media. These porous objects have high surface areas while still allowing the passage of water and light to flow through them; they make excellent homes for bacteria.</p><p>Different species of bacteria grow into healthy colonies all over the surface of the bio-media. There, they help to break down (eat) various toxins in aquarium water. Ammonia, nitrate, and nitrite-loving bacteria remove a large amount of these toxins, just as they would in a natural ecosystem. Bacterial colonies also consume dissolved organic solids such as proteins, sugars, and other carbon-containing compounds.</p><h2>Chemical Media </h2><p>Many aquarists use chemical media to remove toxins and alter water chemistry. When used properly, chemical media is placed in the final portion of the filter. If chemical media is placed first, it will become clogged and need to be replaced long before its chemical filtering properties are exhausted.</p><p>More importantly, placing chemical media before the biological media means that what usually feeds the bacterial colonies will be removed prematurely, before reaching them. As a result, bacteria will be less likely to thrive in the biological filter media. Placing chemical filtration media at the last stage of the filter ensures the bacterial colonies are not affected.</p><p>Types of chemical filtration media include activated carbon, zeolite, peat, ferric hydroxide, and various resins; all are meant to improve water quality.</p>",701
30,https://www.thesprucepets.com/white-residue-on-aquarium-glass-1381226,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Aquarium Care & Maintenance,<h1>How to Remove & Prevent White Residue on Aquarium Glass</h1>,"<h1>How to Remove & Prevent White Residue on Aquarium Glass</h1><p>Hard water is the preferred habitat for certain fish species; unfortunately, it isn't so great for the clean, transparent glass of our fish tanks. If you've ever noticed a white residue forming on the top of your glass in a freshwater aquarium, you're probably seeing the result of the evaporation of hard water. The residue left behind is likely a lime (calcium carbonate plus additional ions) build-up on the glass called ""limescale."" Saltwater aquariums also can get ""salt-creep,"" which is salt residue on the glass and top of the aquarium.</p><p>As mineral-rich aquarium water (hard water) evaporates, the gaseous water leaves behind the heavier elements that adhere to each other and to the glass, leaving an ugly, streaky white residue behind. If you live in a home with hard water you likely have the same kind of build-up around your shower head or faucets. While these residues won't hurt your fish or your aquarium, it can nonetheless make them harder to see and it isn't pleasant to look at spotted and streaked aquarium glass.</p><h2>Safe Removal of Lime Buildup From Glass </h2><p>Lime buildup looks so terrible that there can be a great temptation to use home cleaning products to remove it. However, resist that urge, as even the smallest drop or leftover residue from any cleaning agent will likely be lethal to your fish. This rule goes for the top edges of the tank as well.</p><p>Products made to safely remove lime buildup from aquarium glass are available. Check your local pet store for fish safe cleaning sprays. If you're looking for a greener and more inexpensive alternative, try plain white vinegar on a dry aquarium. Not only is vinegar a natural disinfectant, but its acidity also dissolves stubborn lime deposits.</p><p>For this method of cleaning, you will need to relocate your fish to a holding tank. Once all of your fish have been safely removed, drain the tank completely of water and remove any plants or decorations. Gravel and other substrates can be removed or remain behind if held in place by a barrier to prevent spilling them. Lay the tank down on a towel, and pour enough vinegar on the affected glass to cover it. Let it sit for 10 to 20 minutes, then scrub with a non-abrasive pad or cloth.</p><p>If you have a stubborn patch of build-up, try using a razor blade or algae scraper to gently scrape the scale away from only glass panels. Do not use a razor on plexiglass or other types of acrylic tanks as any sharp tools will easily scratch them. Be careful not to damage the silicone glue holding the glass panes together. Once you're done, rinse the tank thoroughly before refilling.</p><h2>Preventing Lime Buildup </h2><p>The easiest way to avoid spending time scrubbing your tank is to prevent scale from being deposited in the first place. As the evaporation process is the main driver of this residue, check your tank's water line every two or three days. Low humidity days in winter months or warmer temperatures in your tank water will both drive the rate of evaporation upward.</p><p>As the water begins to evaporate, your remaining tank water will become slightly harder (a higher density of minerals per liter of water). For this reason, the best replacement for evaporated hard water is distilled water, if you are only topping off the tank and not doing a water change. The water that escaped was pure, so the water you add back in should be pure water as well. Distilled water has all of the minerals removed from it. Replacing evaporated water with additional mineral-rich water can slowly lead to a lethally high level of some minerals. Using distilled water to replace evaporation eliminates this risk.</p><p>However, when doing a partial water change in your aquarium, you should use your regular hard water source to fill the aquarium after removing some of the old water. This will keep the minerals at a normal level and help buffer the pH, preventing gradual acidification (lowering of the pH) of the water. A water test kit that measures pH, hardness (GH) and alkalinity (kH) is good to have to make sure your water quality is safe for your fish.</p>",705

Find Out Why</h2><p>A fish owner notices fish disappearing, then sees a normally peaceful fish feasting on the carcass of those that have gone missing. Can your fish really be killing and eating your other fish?</p><p>In reality, seeing one fish eat another actually means very little. When a fish dies, other fish in the tank will quickly take advantage of the situation. Even a fish that is still alive, but is very weak or sick, will be picked on by his tank mates. Here's why that happens.</p><h2>Why Do Fish Eat Other Fish? </h2><p>Fish are opportunistic, just like other living creatures. If food presents itself in any form, they will eat it. Sure, that food may have been their best swimming buddy the day before, but today he's lunch. It's all part of that great circle of life.</p><p>So how does a fish owner know who, or what is the real killer? Sometimes it may be an obvious bully, but it's also just as likely that it's not another fish at all. A series of deaths could be the result of a change in water conditions, an outbreak of an undetectable disease, or simply stress. The key is to carefully observe what is going on in the tank. This is particularly true if you've added new fish to the tank or anytime something changes in the aquarium.</p><h2>New Fish Take Time to Adjust </h2><p>New fish in a tank are under close scrutiny by the other fish. A pecking order exists even in a tank of peaceful fish. Territories have already been established and all eyes are upon the newcomer to see which space he will choose. If the other fish become threatened in any way, quarrels might break out, even with normally peaceful fish.</p><p>Observe all the fish closely any time you add a new one to the tank. If you see any signs of aggression, use the old standby trick of rearranging the decor. That alters the previous territories and can settle things down. You may have to remove either the aggressor or the object of the attacks if the aggression continues.</p><p>Make sure there are plenty of hiding places for everyone, even if it means adding more plants, rocks, and other decor.</p><h2>Water Problems Can Play a Role  </h2><p>An ammonia or nitrite spike is an invisible but not uncommon problem that can occur in even a well-established tank, particularly when new fish have been added. This can tax the biological balance in the tank, resulting in a brief spike of ammonia followed by elevated nitrate. The new fish are under stress already due to being caught, bagged, transported, and introduced into an entirely new habitat, so they're more susceptible than usual to a change in water.</p><p>It's also possible to briefly alter the balance in the nitrogen cycle when water changes, filter cleaning, or other types of maintenance are performed. Things will usually settle down quickly, but fish that are already weak can succumb to the stress.</p><p>A chain reaction may occur; one fish dies, adding more organic toxins in the water, and another fish that is already stressed dies too. The domino effect can appear to be a killer fish when it's simply the result of weaker or older fish falling victim to what is happening in the water. Tracking water parameters will help to alert you to such changes.</p><h2>Disease Can Weaken Fish </h2><p>A disease can also be the culprit behind a series of fish deaths. Not all diseases are obvious, which is why quarantining new fish is recommended. Perhaps that new fish you bought was already infected when you put it in with your other fish. Between the stress of being moved and the disease, the fish went belly up the night after you brought it home.</p><p>The other fish discovered the body the next morning and quickly went to work feasting on their newfound breakfast buffet. Now they are all infected as well. Some of them may survive, but weaker ones may perish and be eaten by their tank mates.</p><h2>How to Prevent Your Fish From Eating Each Other </h2><p>It's important to quarantine your fish and to stay on top of everything going on in the tank. Keep a journal so you know the normal behaviors of all your fish. Track the pH, ammonia, nitrite, and temperature so you can see if something is changing in a not-so-good way. Step up your observations whenever you add new fish or make a major change in the tank.</p><p>You aren't as likely to lose any fish when you know your tank. In the event that you do lose some, you're far more likely to know who or what the real killer is.</p>",781
32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/missing-aquarium-fish-1381216,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Find Your Missing Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Find Your Missing Aquarium Fish</h1><p>All aquarium owners have looked at their tank at least one time and noticed a fish was missing. The happy ending to that story is that the fish was behind something and reappeared in short order. However, sometimes the fish is never found at all. Why do fish go missing, and how can a fish simply vanish into thin air (or water)? Any time a fish goes missing, it's important to find it and determine what happened. If fish continue to mysteriously disappear, the need to determine the cause is even more important.</p><h2>Hiding Fish </h2><p>Some species of fish are not comfortable out in the open. They will hide most of the time and can find some very creative out-of-the-way spots. They will wedge themselves under rocks, behind decorations, within clumps of plants, even bury themselves in the substrate. So, before you assume the missing fish has vanished for good, closely inspect everything in the aquarium. You might be surprised by where fish will hide. Even if you locate the missing fish, you may be wondering why they hide so much and what you can do about it. Fish hide for a variety of reasons, from being scared of their surroundings or other fish, to simply not being very social. Nocturnal fish may be very active in the dark but will hide during the day or when the lights are on when you are looking in the aquarium.</p><h2>Jumping Fish </h2><p>Another reason a fish may be missing is that the fish jumped out of the aquarium. Even if the tank has a cover, if there are any openings, it's possible for the fish to jump out. Unfortunately, when a fish jumps, that usually spells doom. Unless you find them shortly after the escape, the fish will soon die and dry up. Any time you've noticed a fish is missing, the first thing to do is quickly examine the area around the tank to see if the fish jumped out. Check behind the tank, and inside the cabinet if the tank is on a stand. The distance from the tank that a fish can be found is surprisingly large, because the fish may wriggle around hoping to find its watery home.</p><p>Surprisingly, some species of fish can survive for a long time out of the water. Fish that have a labyrinth organ can survive for quite a while and may be saved if found in time. If you find a fish outside of the tank, and it is not dried up, return it to the tank. Watch the fish closely to see if it revives, and add some stress coat to the water to help replenish the slime coat that will have been damaged during its trip ""outdoors.""</p><p>If the fish does revive, it will be more susceptible to disease for a period of time and should be watched closely for symptoms of illness. Also observe how the other fish interact with it, as it's not unusual for tank mates to pick on a weak fish. If necessary, move the weak fish to a quarantine tank, or put a breeder net in the main aquarium to separate it from the other fish while it recuperates.</p><h2>Sick Fish </h2><p>Fish that become sick or stressed will often hide. Finding a sick fish that is hiding may be the only chance you have of learning that it is sick and treating it before it dies. Sometimes sick fish become very weak and will be sucked into the filter intake, so make sure you inspect the filter if you are looking for a missing fish. In those cases, the prognosis is grim, but it's better to find them before they die and pass on the disease to their tank mates who will probably eat them. Any time you find a sick fish, it is best to quarantine it in a separate tank to treat it. The reason for this is two-fold, first to keep them from being picked on by other fish, and secondly, so you can treat the disease they are suffering from with medications in a smaller, barren quarantine tank.</p><h2>Dead Fish </h2><p>Obviously, dead fish don't swim. As soon as a fish dies, the other fish in the tank will begin feasting on their former friend. It's not personal; it's nature. Don't assume they murdered their former tank mate. They are just taking the opportunity to have a fresh meal. If the dead fish isn't found soon enough, the entire body may be consumed, leaving no trace of the missing fish. This is often the reason for a mysterious fish disappearance.</p><p>If you are lucky, whatever caused the fish to die is not something that can be passed on to the other fish. However, any time a fish goes missing, it is wise to test the water for ammonia and nitrite to ensure something isn't amiss. There may be disease present, or another fish may have become a bully and is taking out his companions. Observe the other fish carefully on a daily basis for the next week or two, to verify that no other fish are showing signs of illness. Also, watch for signs of aggression. Just because a fish isn't aggressive to start with, doesn't mean it can't become that way later. Changes in the makeup of the tank inhabitants, or even rearranging decor, can impact fish behavior.</p><p>It's also possible the fish died of old age. No fish lives forever, and many fish have rather short lifespans. If you've had your fish for a number of years, some of them may be close to the end of their natural lifespan. Regardless of the reason for the death, dead fish should always be removed promptly.</p><h2>Serial Disappearances </h2><p>If one fish mysteriously disappears and is never found, it may not be a serious issue. However, if one fish disappears and is not found, followed by another and another, something is wrong. Serial fish disappearances can be caused by a number of factors. Water conditions are a top candidate to consider, as well as disease, and even a bully who is murdering his tank mates. Another possibility is that the fish are all old. If a group of the same species is purchased at the same time from the same shop, they may be similar in age. Eventually advancing age starts taking them, one by one.</p><p>When faced with serial disappearances, test the water for ammonia, nitrite, and pH. Compare to previous tests to see if there is a pH drift or spike in ammonia or nitrite. Any of those changes can stress the fish and lead to disease and death. Look for any sign of disease, lack of appetite, unusual breathing, and odd behavior in general. All may be signs of disease or stress that can ultimately leave fish more susceptible to disease. Monitor fish interaction closely to see if any fish are exhibiting aggression. If aggressive behavior is noted, move the aggressive fish to another aquarium or place a divider in the tank to separate him from the other fish. If the disappearances stop, you've found the culprit.</p><p>Lastly, if you have serial disappearances, don't give in to the urge to immediately replace the lost fish. Until you know why the fish are disappearing, it's not wise to add more potential victims to the equation.</p>",1214

However, for beginners, choosing a small aquarium is courting failure. When the water volume is small, key water parameters change very quickly and leave no room for error.</p><p>Even experienced aquarists are challenged by a small aquarium. Newcomers to the hobby should stay away from tanks under 20 gallons until you become experienced. The bigger the tank, the less impact a mistake will have on the fish.</p><h2>Adding Fish Too Soon </h2><p>New aquarium owners are eager to add fish, often the same day they set up the tank. Some are lucky but many will quickly lose some, or all, of their fish. The water in a new tank needs to stabilize. Gases are dissolved in the water as well as minerals, heavy metals, and chemicals added to local water treatment facilities. The water itself can harm the fish. Aquarium water needs to be treated with water conditioner to neutralize harmful materials and allowed to stand for a day or so to allow dissolved gases to escape and the pH to stabilize. You want to make sure the filtration system is working and the heater brings the water to the correct temperature, and the tank is not leaking for at least a day. Then, it will be safe to introduce a few fish to the aquarium.</p><h2>Adding Too Many Fish at Once </h2><p>You may feel eager to fill the tank with fish, but unfortunately adding too many fish all at once is another common mistake of new owners. Until the beneficial bacterial colonies have become fully established in the bio-filter, the aquarium cannot safely support a full load of fish. In the beginning, only add a couple of small hardy fish. Wait until both the ammonia and nitrite levels have risen and then fallen to zero before adding more fish. It usually take about 3-6 weeks for a new aquarium to go through the initial nitrogen cycle, so fish should be added only a few per week during this time.</p><h2>Overstocking the Aquarium </h2><p>It is very common for new owners to overstock the aquarium. Although an experienced person may successfully keep a school of 20 small fish in a ten-gallon aquarium, it would be disastrous for a beginner to attempt it.</p><p>The net gallons of water should be the amount of water actually placed in the aquarium after the gravel and decorations are in it. You will want to use an 80 percent ratio of tank volume to actual water in the aquarium.</p><p>For example, a ""10-gallon aquarium"" may only hold 8 gallons of water after the decorations and gravel have been added. Using the one inch of fish length per gallon of water rule, 8 inches of fish is a maximum number to be safely kept. That could be 8 fish that grow to be one inch long when full-grown, or 4 fish that grow to be 2-inches long when full-grown. It is always wise to go under the maximum to rather than over. This is just a general rule and bigger aquariums with large filtration systems can often hold more fish than this, if the water quality is managed properly.</p><h2>Keeping Incompatible Fish </h2><p>New aquarium owners often choose fish that look appealing to them without knowing their environmental needs. Some fish may fight with one another or require widely different water conditions. Always research each species before choosing tank mates. Select peaceful fish that thrive in similar water conditions.</p><h2>Overfeeding Your Fish </h2><p>One of the most common mistakes made by fish owners is overfeeding the fish. Fish are opportunistic and will seek food at all times. Just because they appear hungry does not mean they need to be fed all the time. Feed them no more than they completely consume in five minutes. If food is left over after five minutes, remove the food with a net and feed less food next time.</p><p>During startup, feed fish no more than once per day; during critical times when ammonia or nitrite levels are high, withhold feeding for a day or two to reduce the wastes being produced. Fish can easily go several days without food and not suffer ill effects. Once your aquarium has cycled and the ammonia and nitrite levels are zero, you can start feeding your fish twice daily.</p><h2>Insufficient Filtration </h2><p>The flow of water through the filter is what makes the water safe for your fish. An aquarium filter should pass all the water in the tank through it at least three times per hour. If it does not, it is too small. If in doubt about filter size, move to the next larger size. You cannot over-filter, but you can definitely under-filter, and the results can be harmful to your fish.</p><h2>Not Testing the Water </h2><p>New owners do not magically have full knowledge of the nitrogen cycle nor do they know they need to test the water chemistry in their aquarium. As a result, they can fail to take steps to deal with harmful toxins that accumulate in the water quickly in a new aquarium.</p><p>When the tank is first set up, allow it to run for a day or two. Before adding the fish, test the pH, hardness, alkalinity, ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels for a baseline record. During the startup cycle, it is important to test the ammonia and nitrite often (see nitrogen cycle for details). Once the tank is well established, test the water monthly to find unseen problems that may be brewing. If fish suddenly die, test the water to see if anything has changed.</p><h2>Not Changing the Water </h2><p>New owners are not always educated about aquarium maintenance, which includes changing part of the water on a regular basis. Wastes build up in the tank that can only be removed by vacuuming the gravel and removing some water and replacing it with fresh water. Normally a partial water change is made weekly in a new aquarium, and then once a month once the bio-filter has become established. Removing and replacing about 20 percent of the water is usually sufficient with each water change. Make more frequent water changes if the water quality test results are not at the correct levels for your fish. Always add dechlorinator or water conditioner to tap water before adding it into your aquarium.</p><p>Although your fish may not die if you fail at maintenance and regular water changes, they will be stressed by substandard water conditions. As a result, they will be more susceptible to disease and often will have a shorter lifespan than they should have.</p><p>Home Aquarium.</p><p>Aquarium Water Quality.</p>",1154
34,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-clean-a-dirty-fish-tank-1380968,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>How to Clean a Dirty Fish Tank</h1>,"<h1>How to Clean a Dirty Fish Tank</h1><h2>Healthy and happy community aquariums require clean, safe environments</h2><p>Clean your aquarium without completely breaking down all the beneficial bacterial colonies that eliminate the animals' waste. It's important to properly clean your aquarium, so your fish can remain happy and healthy. With a few simple cleaning supplies, your aquarium can be shipshape again in no time.</p><h2>What You'll Need </h2> <h2>Cleaning the Inside Glass </h2><p>Start by giving the glass a good cleaning on the inside with an algae pad. There are a wide variety of algae scrapers on the market, from long-handled scrubbers to magnetic scrubbers.</p><p>Buy algae pads at a pet shop instead of the housewares department of a regular store. Although they may look the same, the housewares pads can have soap or chemical residue. That residue doesn't matter if you are cleaning your kitchen sink, but it can be lethal to your fish.</p><p>For stubborn residue on the glass, use a razor blade to scrape it off. Take care not to cut yourself. If your aquarium is acrylic, use a plastic razor blade, as standard razors will scratch the acrylic.</p><h2>Cleaning Decorations and Rocks </h2><p>Once the inside glass is clean, remove rocks, artificial plants, and decorations that have significant algae growth or are noticeably dirty. Do not clean them with soap or detergents. It's very difficult to completely remove soap, and even a trace can be harmful to fish. Usually, a good scrub with an algae scraper in warm water will remove the algae and dirt from rocks and plants.</p><p>For particularly stubborn cleaning problems, prepare a 10 percent bleach solution and soak the items for 15 minutes. Scrub any remaining residue off, rinse well in running water, and let air dry to eliminate residual bleach. Don't put them back in the aquarium until there is no more chlorine smell present. You can also rinse them in water that has dechlorinator (sodium thiosulfate) added to it to remove the chlorine.</p><p>Live plants can be bleached to remove algae from them. However, stem plants are not tolerant of bleaching. To bleach live plants prepare a 5 percent bleach solution, soak the plants for two to three minutes, then rinse well.</p><p>Leave the rocks, decorations, and plants out of the tank while you vacuum the gravel. That way none of the debris stirred up from the gravel will settle on them.</p><p>Be sure to get a new bucket and designate it for aquarium use only. If you use a bucket that has had soap or detergent in it, you could introduce unwanted chemicals into your aquarium.</p><h2>Siphon to Clean Aquarium Gravel </h2><p>Clean the gravel next, by using a water siphon to vacuum away the debris. There are several types of siphons available, all of which work essentially the same. The gravel vacuum should stir up the gravel and remove debris without sucking up the gravel. Be sure to vacuum the entire surface of the gravel thoroughly so that all debris is removed.</p><p>The water that is removed with the debris using the gravel vacuum is replaced with dechlorinated water, which performs a water change in your aquarium. Be sure the replacement water is the same temperature as your aquarium water. You should unplug your aquarium heater during water changes to prevent it from being exposed to air as the water level drops. A 25 percent water change is a good amount for a monthly water change during cleaning.</p><h2>Outside Glass and Fixtures </h2><p>Once the inside of the aquarium is cleaned, clean the hood, light, tank top, and outside the glass. Regular glass cleaners contain ammonia, which is toxic to fish. Standard lime cleaners are even more toxic. It is strongly recommended that you use vinegar or a cleaner designated as aquarium safe, and make sure you rinse the surfaces with a clean damp cloth.</p><h2>Clean the Filter Two Weeks Later </h2><p>Once the outside is clean, the rocks, plants, and other decorations may be returned to the tank. Now, wait a couple of weeks before cleaning the filter. Why wait? The major cleaning you just performed disturbed the beneficial bacterial colonies on the plants, rocks, and gravel.</p><p>Fortunately, many beneficial bacteria reside within the filter media, so you haven't completely upset the ecosystem. However if you changed the filter at the same time, you might trigger a dangerous ammonia spike because there aren't enough beneficial bacteria left to eliminate the toxins.</p><p>If you have filter media containing carbon, ammonia absorbers, or ion-exchange resins, it should be replaced if it's more than three weeks old. After a couple of weeks, the absorbing qualities of the media have been exhausted, and it no longer serves its purpose.</p><p>A medium that acts as a mechanical filter instead of absorbing toxins (i.e. ceramic rings, filter fiber, or sponges) should be gently rinsed to remove debris and returned to the filter instead of replaced. If care is taken to use water that is the same temperature as the aquarium water and the media is quickly returned to the filter, the bacterial colonies growing on them will not be lost entirely.</p><p>Don't forget to clean the filter tubing and other parts of the filter assembly. A filter brush will help clear out the sludge that builds up in all the small crevices.</p><h2>Ongoing Maintenance </h2><p>Once you've gotten your tank in shape, make sure you clean it on a regular basis so it never needs a major spring cleaning again. Scrape the glass weekly, vacuum the gravel every time you perform a water change, and clean any rocks or plants as soon as you see debris or algae on them.</p><p>Clean the filter monthly, either by replacing the media or rinsing it. While you are at it, soak your fishnets in a disinfectant solution to keep them clean and soft. With regular care, your aquarium will look beautiful all the time.</p><p>You can clean the bottom of the tank, where you'd most need the vacuum, with a water siphon. You can buy them at pet supply shops, or even make your own.</p><p>As soon as you notice a dead fish in your tank, remove it asap. Examine it to figure out if it died of natural causes or had a disease. If the fish is bloated or appears to be diseased, test if the water in the tank is of poor quality. If it is, that may have been what killed your fish and you need to adjust it accordingly. If that's not the case, you will need to do an emergency water change to make sure the rest of the fish in your tank are not stricken with whatever killed the dead fish. Be sure to do a complete clean of the tank, as well as any accessories or decorations within.</p><p>Ponds have ""features"" that tanks do not: other organisms, native plants, access to rainwater, and more. They're more of a living environment than a tank and therefore self-cleaning.</p><p>When soap and water are not a good thing.</p>",1149
35,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-set-up-a-cichlid-tank-4842969,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>How to Set Up a Cichlid Tank</h1>,"<h1>How to Set Up a Cichlid Tank</h1><p>Cichlids are a diverse group of fishes. Primarily differentiated by region of origin, there are hundreds of cichlid species available for hobbyists to keep and culture. Before you decide to bring some cichlids home to add to your aquarium, it is vital to research their optimum water quality parameters, space requirements, environmental design, stocking densities, breeding practices, feeding behavior and diet. There is no ""one rule"" for all cichlid species!</p><h2>Water Quality Parameters </h2><p>Since cichlids come from so many varied regions, there are restrictions against mixing species based on varying water quality needs. Depending on your species and their native region, you may require soft, acidic water or more basic, hard water. Many cichlid owners start with RO or reverse osmosis water, since it gives them the ability to manipulate their source water, especially for acidic, soft water aquariums suitable for South American cichlid species. For most African cichlid species, hard, basic water is needed, and special salt mixes for these species are available at fish stores and can be added to the RO water to mix it to the appropriate pH, hardness (GH) and alkalinity (KH),</p><h2>Space Requirements </h2><p>Cichlids come in a wide variety of sizes, but don't think that smaller fish need less room! Some species of cichlids can be very aggressive over resources such as territory, hiding places, breeding space, mates and food. Many cichlid owners should consider a larger tank than necessary when mixing multiple species. For species with strict stocking densities, do your research first. If it is your first time with cichlids, stick to easy-going, less aggressive species, such as some of the Central American cichlids. African cichlids are very territorial and will chase each other around the aquarium, so a large tank with many hiding spaces is needed for them.</p><h3>Environmental Design </h3><p>When designing your aquarium, it's easy to consider what you find appealing, not what your fish need. Try to consider your intended species' entire life cycle. What type of environment most closely resembles their natural environment? If you intended to breed your fish, what reproductive strategy do your fish use? If you plan to use ""natural elements,"" such as found rocks or wood pieces, make sure the type of rock and species of wood is safe for fish and properly cleaned prior to adding to your tank.</p><p>Many owners make the mistake of over-decorating their aquariums. Larger fish, fish that swim in schools, flighty or aggressive fish are easily snagged on decor items such as branches or twigs. If your fish need cover, but don't do well with solid objects, consider switching rocks and wood for fake or live plants.</p><p>Some aggressive fish may take personal offense to some elements in their tank and attack them. This could be a misplaced plant, a humming aerator or an electronic heater. Necessary elements, such as heaters, may require the addition of a sump to keep your fish from hurting themselves and destroying equipment. If you do not have the option of adding a sump, you may need to fortify your equipment with a false back or secret cave your fish cannot access.</p><p>The type of decor in the aquarium will vary widely from African cichlids, which require large rock formations with many caves and niches, to heavily planted aquariums for angelfish and other Amazon species.</p><h2>Stocking Densities </h2><h2>Breeding Practices </h2><p>There are many different breeding strategies employed by the various cichlid species. Some are mouth brooders, where the parent fish carries the eggs in its mouth; some will build elaborate caves and lay their eggs on the side walls, carefully guarding them; Some lay their eggs on the leaves of aquatic plants; others are open water spawners, throwing their eggs and sperm about the tank. If you plan on breeding your fish, be sure you have a male and female and their ideal breeding setup. If you are NOT planning on breeding your fish, try to keep single-sex tanks or be prepared for potentially aggressive, unfulfilled spawning desires. Just because you didn't consider breeding more fish, doesn't mean your fish won't.</p><h2>Feeding Behavior </h2><p>Depending on where they live in the wild, various species of cichlids will have different feeding strategies. Some eat at the surface, some in the middle of the water column, and some on the bottom, digging through substrate. A few species are predators that will eat other fish, or nibble on their scales, fins and even eyes. Although many captive-bred cichlid species have learned how to swim up to the top of the tank at feeding time, you will need to consider how your fish find their food. If you have a lot of surface feeders and only a few bottom feeders, how will the fish on the bottom get enough to eat? Do you have any species that are especially aggressive toward food and will bully anyone who looks at them while they try to eat? Do you have appropriate substrate for bottom feeding fish to dig through? Does your species of cichlid prefer live food (such as Oscars) or frozen food? There are many important points to consider when feeding your fish and simply ""dumping some food at the top"" will not work for every system and species.</p><h2>Cichlid Diets </h2><p>Along with the wide variety of cichlid species comes a diverse collection of herbivores, omnivores, carnivores and all levels in between. Depending on what mix of species you choose, you may need more than one diet to keep all your fish healthy. Do not assume a can of ""cichlid flakes"" will do the job. Many cichlid species do best with a varied diet.</p><p>There is no ""one size fits all"" when it comes to a cichlid aquarium. Do thorough research before you buy anything! Although you may have your heart set on one species, you may not have the space or setup to house them. Don't cut corners thinking your new cichlids will make do with whatever you have ready. Many of these species have strict water quality, space, diet and other requirements that will cause serious disease and possibly death if you ignore them. Cichlids are also long-lived species of fish, often living from 10 to even 20 years in aquariums! So, be sure to plan ahead and get the correct setup - as they will be your pets for a long time if well cared for.</p>",1055
36,https://www.thesprucepets.com/holiday-and-vacation-fish-care-and-feeding-1378525,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Holiday and Vacation Fish Care and Feeding</h1>,"<h1>Holiday and Vacation Fish Care and Feeding</h1><p>Are you traveling for the holidays or planning to go on a vacation soon? What will you do with your fish while you're away? Fortunately, there are several easy options to feed your fish during holiday and vacation periods: you can find a fish sitter; use commercial vacation feeders available through your fish store; or you can purchase an automatic fish feeder, which can be used on a daily basis anyway. A final option is to simply let your fish go unfed while you are gone. (Before you faint at that option, read on!)</p><h2>Vacation Feeders </h2><p>The simplest option for feeding is to use vacation feeders. They are available in 2-day (weekend), 7-day, and 14-day sizes. There are two basic types: one where the food is embedded in a calcium block, and the other style has the food in a gel. In each case, the block gradually dissolves in the water, releasing food particles for the fish to eat.</p><p>Make sure that the number of blocks used in the aquarium is sufficient for all of the fish in the aquarium. But it is better to underfeed the fish than overfeed them for the time you are away. If using the larger calcium blocks, especially in soft water conditions, they can impact the aquarium water chemistry. The gel feeders are less likely to cause water quality changes, but some say their fish won't eat them.</p><h2>Automatic Feeders </h2><p>Automatic feeders come in electric plug-in models and battery-operated models. They have timers that can be set to dispense the proper amount of food one or more times per day. The opening in the food-holding dispenser can be adjusted to deliver a certain amount of food at each feeding. These are great to use anytime, and if you have it before you go on vacation, you can adjust the timing and dispensed food quantity to feed the fish correctly every day. As long as the food dispenser is full before you leave, and holds enough food to dispense for the duration you will be gone, these work well for feeding your fish while you are away.</p><h2>Fish Sitter </h2><p>If you are going on an extended vacation or holiday (more than a week), you should have someone tend your fish. The most important thing to impress upon your helper is that they should not overfeed your fish. Excess food will foul the aquarium and can prove lethal. Many fish will ""beg"" for more food even when they are well fed (Angelfish are notorious for begging), but should not be indulged. In order to prevent your house sitter from giving too much food, you should pre-measure each meal in a small container or plastic bag.</p><p>One good option is to use an inexpensive plastic pill dispenser that has a compartment for each day of the week. As you feed your fish the week before you leave, place the same amount of food in one of the pill compartments. By the end of the week, you will have the next week's feedings all prepared for your helper. All they have to do is open the dispenser each day and put the food in that day's compartment into the aquarium. Feeding the fish once a day while you are gone, even if you normally feed the fish twice daily, will usually be sufficient. It is better to underfeed than overfeed!</p><h2>Don't Feed Your Fish </h2><p>Living in a watery environment has its advantages fish don't have to wait for you to give them a drink. As for food, freshwater fish are quite capable of going for several days without a meal. Healthy adult fish can go for a week or two without feeding. However, young fish don't have the fat stores of adult fish and they cannot go without eating very long.</p><p>That doesn't mean you should routinely skip feedings, but your fish can safely be left without food over a long holiday weekend. However, keep in mind that food is not the only concern when going on holiday. You must be sure your filter, water heater, and lighting is also properly maintained if you are not home.</p><h2>Get a Timer </h2><p>Aquarium lights normally should be turned off at night and turned back on in the morning. Lighting is easy to handle by purchasing a timer. There's no need to get a fancy or expensive one, as long as it will turn the aquarium lights on and off once each day. Put the light on a timer and leave it that way all the time. Then, your fish will have a consistent day/night cycle, and you have one less thing to do each day.</p><h2>Water Temperature </h2><p>Aquarium water temperature should remain fairly constant. Fish are accustomed to gradual seasonal changes in temperature in the wild, but if the change is dramatic, the stress will make them susceptible to disease. If the holiday is during the cold time of year, be sure your aquarium heater is working, and don't turn your house temperature down too low. Tropical fish prefer water temperatures from about 74-78 degrees Fahrenheit and do not do well below a water temperature of 65 degrees.</p><p>During summer vacations, set your air conditioning to kick in if the room temperature rises above 80 degrees, and your fish will be quite comfortable while you are away. If you do not have air conditioning, it is wise to arrange for someone to come in and check the fish in the event of a heat wave.</p><h2>Fish Physical Condition </h2><p>Another important factor is the physical condition of your fish. Just before leaving on your holiday or vacation, examine them to ensure that none of them appear to be sick. If you notice any abnormalities, consult a fish shop or an aquatic veterinarian before leaving. Otherwise, you risk coming home to an aquarium of sick or dying fish.</p><p>Be sure to provide your fish sitter with your contact phone number, as well as the number of your pet shop. Regardless of whether you have a fish sitter or not, if you prepare ahead of time you can safely go on trips.</p>",1015

What is aged aquarium water, and how does an aquarium hobbyist get it?</p><p>To put it simply, aged aquarium water is water that has been allowed to sit and ""age"" for at least 24 hours prior to use. Anyone can age their own water. The bigger question is whether using aged water is preferable to using chemically treated water. There are pros and cons to each.</p><h2>Why Use Aged Aquarium Water? </h2><p>At one time early in the aquarium hobby, the standard was to use aged water. At that time, department stores and chain pet shops did not exist. Often an LFS (local fish shop) was a fair distance away and was only open for limited hours. Therefore it wasn't always quick or convenient to get chemicals to treat tap water before use in an aquarium. On the other hand, aged water cost nothing but the time it took to let it stand. Therefore it was a popular alternative to chemically-treated tap water to remove chlorine or other treatments used by local water treatment facilities. Virtually everyone had buckets or tanks of water sitting around that were being aged.</p><p>Another advantage of aged water is that the water chemistry is allowed to stabilize. Water delivered to a tap is under pressure, and therefore contains dissolved gases, in particular, CO2. A significant amount of dissolved CO2 will temporarily lower the pH of the water. After standing for a period of time, the pH will rise, sometimes significantly. The change will vary based on the amount of dissolved CO2.</p><p>Regardless of how small, changes in pH are stressful for fish. If the change is extreme enough, it can be lethal. Allowing water to age so it reaches a more stable pH has advantages for the health of your fish.</p><h2>Is Chemically Aged Water Better? </h2><p>With the advent of department stores that carry basic aquarium supplies and are open 24 hours a day, it has become easier to obtain chemical water treatments. It is even possible to order aquarium products, such as water treatments, via the Internet and have them delivered to your door. Furthermore, most new aquarium packages come with a small bottle of water treatment. As a result, the trend has moved away from using aged aquarium water most of the time, and now owners now use chemically treated water most of the time. Does that mean using chemicals to ""age"" water is better? Not necessarily.</p><p>Chemical treatments have two primary advantages. They render water safe for use almost immediately, which is a huge improvement on the one to two days' wait for aged water. The other advantage is that chemicals can neutralize heavy metals and other dissolved constituents that the aging process cannot touch. This is particularly important in areas where water sources have a high mineral content. Most chemical treatments also include a component such as a stress coat that soothes the skin of the fish.</p><p>By aging water, the dissolved gases have time to be driven off, and the water temperature can also be stabilized to the desired range. The use of a chemical treatment ensures that any heavy metals or other harmful chemicals are neutralized. The added benefit of the stress coat is a great side benefit of using a chemical treatment. The negative is that it takes time to age the water while still incurring the additional cost of a chemical treatment.</p><h2>How To Age Aquarium Water </h2><p>There are two ways to age water. One is to place water in a clean bucket or water jug (with the cap off) and allow it to sit for several days. This method takes a bit longer but doesn't require any additional equipment. It's often used to age smaller quantities of water, either for a small tank or for topping off a larger tank. The downside of this method is the smaller quantity of water that can be aged this way. It also doesn't allow for adjusting the water temperature to the desired range. However, because most homes are relatively warm, this is usually not a problem if the water is only being used to top off a larger tank.</p><p>Another method to age water is in an aquarium. It may be the aquarium that will have fish added later or simply an extra tank used solely for the purpose of aging water. There are several advantages to aging water in this fashion. First, it allows for a larger volume of water to be aged. It also speeds up the process, as a filter, powerhead, or other means to agitate the water can be employed. Vigorously aerating the water more rapidly drives off dissolved gases, as well as chlorine. What would take three days in a water jug, can be accomplished overnight in a tank with heavy aeration.</p><p>The other big advantage of using an aquarium to age water is that a heater can be used, thus allowing the water to be heated to the desired temperature. By stabilizing the pH and temperature, the aquarium owner can minimize stress to the fish. When setting up a new aquarium, I strongly recommend aging the water in the tank for at least one day or more. Use a water treatment, and you have the best of both worlds. But remember, aging the water doesn't start the nitrogen cycle. That won't kick in until you add fish to the tank.</p>",901
38,https://www.thesprucepets.com/using-zeolite-in-aquariums-1380937,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>When and How to Use Zeolite in Your Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>When and How to Use Zeolite in Your Aquarium</h1><p>Zeolite types of media do an amazing job of getting rid of ammonia in your aquarium. Given that track record, why not use zeolite in your filter all the time? Although opinions vary, most agree that zeolite is great for emergency situations, but is generally not ideal for on-going long-term use.</p><h2>What Is Zeolite? </h2><p>Zeolites are highly absorbent porous minerals, composed largely of silica and aluminum. They are useful for their ability to capture and hold a variety of undesirable materials, much like a sponge absorbs water.</p><p>However, not all zeolite is created equal. How the zeolite was formed impacts it's makeup, and consequently the applications for which it is best suited. Clinoptilolite, or Clino, is a naturally occurring form of zeolite that has a particularly high affinity for ammonia, making it a desirable media material. In addition to the various natural forms of zeolite, there are now artificially created forms of zeolite that differ from natural forms in their makeup. </p><p>When choosing zeolite for your aquarium, select one that is labeled specifically for aquarium use. For instance, most cat litter contains zeolite. It's not formulated for aquarium use, and it isn't recommended. There is zeolite formulated specifically for freshwater aquariums, as well as for both freshwater and saltwater aquariums. Either formula is suitable for freshwater aquariums. There are also some formulas available that combine activated carbon and zeolite, a combination that is well suited to a newly set up aquarium that is experiencing a severe ammonia spike.</p><h2>What Zeolite Does and Doesn't Do </h2><p>Zeolite formulated for freshwater aquarium use will readily absorb ammonia, making it a useful media when dealing with ammonia spikes or potential spikes. It is important to know that zeolite does not remove every undesirable toxin in your tank, nor does it work forever. In fact, it becomes saturated fairly quickly, at which point it no longer provides any benefit.</p><p>Within a month or less, it is exhausted and should be replaced or recharged. In cases of extremely high ammonia levels, the zeolite may become exhausted in two weeks or less. When ammonia levels are elevated, always test frequently, replacing the zeolite as needed until the desired results are achieved. Once the ammonia has been eliminated, remove the zeolite.</p><h2>When Not to Use Zeolite in Your Aquarium </h2><p>Experts disagree on the value of using zeolite in a newly set up aquarium. Many feel the biologicals should be allowed to develop naturally. If a dangerously high ammonia spike should occur, the use of zeolite on a short-term basis is warranted. This is true even in a newly set up aquarium, as ammonia poisoning can quickly prove fatal in those situations. It is advisable to remove the zeolite once the ammonia levels drop. Zeolite should not be used on an ongoing permanent basis. Instead, it should be removed and replaced with standard media, such as activated carbon.</p><p>Zeolite formulated for freshwater should never be used in saltwater or brackish tanks. The effect on the water chemistry can be lethal for corals in saltwater aquariums. Nor should salt be added to a freshwater aquarium when zeolite media is already being used. Adding salt can cause the zeolite to release the ammonia it has absorbed, causing a sudden and potentially dangerous ammonia spike.</p><h2>Placement of Zeolite in Your Aquarium Filter </h2><p>Zeolite is generally provided in a form similar to carbon media and is placed in a bag within the filter. It may be purchased in loose bulk form or already measured into media bags. In a canister filter, the zeolite should be placed in between the foam or mechanical media, and the rings or biological media.</p><p>Some manufacturers offer a zeolite pad that can be cut to fit in a power filter or fitted next to the foam in a canister filter. Zeolite may also be placed in a bag and hung inside the tank directly into the water flow, instead of being placed inside the filter. The advantage is ease of removal and replacement, which is particularly useful if frequent replacement or recharges are anticipated.</p><h2>Recharge or Replace Zeolite? </h2><p>The zeolite used in freshwater aquariums can be recharged by soaking it in a 5% salt solution, which causes it to release the ammonia it has absorbed. After soaking for 24 hours spread it on a cookie tray and allow it to dry in the sun for a day or two.</p><p>A faster alternative is to bake it in an oven for a half-hour to an hour at 350 F to dry it out. The advantage of sun drying is that the zeolite may be left in its original bag, which often is not safe to subject to high temperatures. Obviously given the amount of time the recharging process takes, many do not feel the effort is worth it for small quantities of zeolite.</p><p>As previously stated, zeolite must be removed once it is exhausted. If the ammonia is gone or nearly gone, it is not necessary to replace the zeolite in the filter. Instead, use standard media. If zeolite is recharged, it should be discarded after two to three months of use, and replaced with new zeolite.</p>",877
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/determine-sex-of-fish-1378347,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>How to Determine the Sex of Your Fish</h1>,"<h1>How to Determine the Sex of Your Fish</h1><p>Depending on the species, determining the sex of a fish ranges from easy to nearly impossible. Knowing the sexual differences in aquarium fish is important when trying to breed fish and also for choosing the proper balance of fish for a community aquarium. Although not all fish can be easily identified by sex, these tips will help you recognize the sex of many of the common species of aquarium fish.</p><h2>Determining Fish Sex </h2><p>Here is how you can figure out the sex of common aquarium fish. This is by no means an exhaustive list but it does provide a general overview of the differences between the fish sexes.</p><h2>Angelfish </h2><h2>Bettas </h2><h2>Catfish </h2><p>Generally speaking, catfish sexes cannot be distinguished. Many species of catfish have not been bred in captivity. The notable exception is the Corydoras species, which has often been bred in captivity. In the Corydoras catfish, the female is usually a bigger-bodied fish than the males. The males will chase a gravid female (full of eggs) around the tank and then she will lay the eggs on a flat surface, such as a plant leaf, smooth rock, or even the aquarium glass. The males swim over the eggs and fertilize them, then the eggs are abandoned.</p><h2>Cichlids </h2><p>Cichlids are such a diverse group that it would take a small novel to give specifics for knowing the difference within each species. While many are not easily differentiated, there are a few rules of thumb that apply to quite a few cichlid species.</p><p>Males are often slimmer but larger-bodied than females and are more vibrantly colored. The dorsal and anal fins of the male are more pointed, larger, and more flowing than in the female. In many species, the male will display egg-shaped markings on the anal fin known as egg spots. Some males have a bump on the head, referred to as a nuchal hump. Although females can also develop a nuchal hump when spawning, it is never as prominent as that of the male. Typically the dominant male will have a larger nuchal hump than other males.</p><p>Although the above general rules apply to many species of cichlids, if you are considering breeding them, do your homework on the specific species before seeking a breeding pair.</p><h2>Cyprinids </h2><p>Barbs and other members of the cyprinid family are rather difficult to tell apart. Differences will vary by species, but generally, males are more intensely colored and slimmer than females. Since most cyprinids are schooling fish, one way to obtain a breeding pair is to purchase a group of them. In some species of cyprinids, including goldfish, the males will get small white bumps (nuptial tubercles) on their head, operculum, and possibly the spine of the pectoral fins during the mating season. The males will chase the female who will lay her eggs and the males fertilize them as she deposits them. After breeding, usually, there is no care of the eggs, and the parents may even eat them if they are found.</p><h2>Gourami </h2><p>Gouramis are another species of fish that are not easily identified. Males and females often are similarly colored and shaped. There is, however, one fairly universal sexual difference seen in most gourami species. The dorsal fin is long and comes to a distinct point in males, while females have a shorter, rounded dorsal fin.</p><p>In addition, certain species of gourami show color variations between the sexes. The male pearl gourami has a deep red-orange coloration on the throat and breast. The male moonlight gourami has orange to red coloration of the pelvic fins. Like the betta, many gouramis will build a bubble nest, but both the male and female are involved in taking care of the eggs.</p><h2>Livebearing Fish </h2><p>Among the easiest of all fish to tell apart are the livebearing fish, such as the guppies, platys, mollies, and swordtails. Males are usually smaller and more colorful than females. They also possess an external sexual organ, the gonopodium, which makes it easy to differentiate males from females. In the male, the anal fin is rod-shaped, while the female has a traditional fan-shaped anal fin. The gonopodium is used to fertilize eggs inside of the female fish as the male swims alongside the female. The internally fertilized eggs will hatch inside the female and then she will ""give birth"" to the babies.</p><h2>Tetras </h2><p>Tetras do have some differences between sexes, which vary based on the species. The females are a bit larger and plumper than males. Males are often more vibrantly colored and may have longer fins than their female counterparts. Tetras are schooling fish, so breeding pairs can be obtained simply by purchasing a small school of them at one time. Generally, they breed by the males chasing the females and fertilizing the eggs as she lays them in the plants or scattered among the rocks. There is no parental care for the eggs, which may be eaten if discovered by the fish.</p>",834
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/schooling-fish-1378344,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Schooling Fish</h1>,"<h1>Schooling Fish</h1><h2>How They Swim So Close Without Colliding</h2><p>Few aquarium scenes are more enjoyable than a group of fish swimming in unison, changing directions in an instant, yet never colliding with each other. How are fish able to swim in such perfect unison? Why do some fish swim alone while others prefer living in schools? Is it necessary to keep aquarium fish in schools?</p><p>Not everything is known about schooling behavior, but here is what experts know about how and why fish swim in schools.</p><h2>Why Fish Swim in Schools </h2><p>First and foremost, schools protect fish from their enemies. It's the same rule our mothers taught us as youngsters, always stay in a group because there is safety in numbers. Predators find it far easier to chase down and gobble up a fish swimming all alone rather than trying to cut out a single fish from a huge group. The same holds in reverse. Fish can better defend their territory in a group. Bullies will think twice about facing an angry school of dozens or hundreds of fish.</p><p>It is also believed that swimming close together reduces friction and allows fish to conserve energy while swimming. When dinner time comes along, food is easier to find as a group. Having 50 sets of eyes and noses gives the school a better chance of locating food. Last but not least, when fish spawn a school ensures that at least some of their eggs will elude predators due to the sheer numbers produced by a large group of fish.</p><h2>How They Swim So Close Without Colliding </h2><p>A complex combination of senses allows fish to achieve those smooth schooling movements we marvel at. At one time it was believed a leader in the school directed the movements of the entire school. However, it is now known that each fish responds to the movements of the other fish, as well as stimuli such as pheromones. If one fish moves in a different direction all the others sense it and move accordingly.</p><p>The anatomy of fish also factors into the schooling equation. Eye placement on the sides of the head allows the fish to readily see what is next to them and move accordingly. However, sight is not the only factor used in schooling. Fish can establish their placement and direction in a school by using hearing, lateral line, sight, and even the sense of smell.</p><h2>Do All Fish School? </h2><p>It is estimated that more than 25 percent of the world's fish species school throughout their lives and many schooling fishes spend a large portion of their lives in schools. As a rule, smaller fish are more likely to live out their lives in schools, although some large fish will school together.</p><p>Furthermore, not all fish that school do so for protection in numbers. Some of the fiercest fish in the world live in schools. Piranha fish live in large schools that they are born into. Although they tolerate their brothers and sisters, a sick or weak piranha in a school will be eaten by the others.</p><h2>How Many Fish Make a School? </h2><p>There isn't a magic number that defines a school. However, in the wild schools of fish are generally quite large, often numbering in the hundreds or even thousands. In captivity, schooling fish need to have at least four to six to create a comfortable school. The adage, the more the merrier, definitely applies to schools of fish. In other words, you can't have too many fish in a school.</p><h2>Fish That Prefer Schools </h2><p>Quite a few popular freshwater fish prefer to live in schools. Barbs, Danios, and most Tetras like black phantom tetras should always be kept in schools. Loaches such as the Clown and Kuhli loach often will pine away if they are not kept in a school of their kind, while the weather loach doesn't need to be in a school. Even larger fish such as the Silver Dollar prefer to live in a school.</p><p>It's a good idea to do your homework before choosing and purchasing a new fish, so know you upfront if they are best kept in a school. If the fish you are considering prefers to live in a school you should plan on purchasing at least four of the same species. Generally, it's best if you can purchase them all at the same time. If not, purchase as many as you can at once and make sure that adding additional fish to the school at a later time is not a source of stress for the species you've chosen.</p><p>Also consider the size of the tank required to keep a school, as schools require more space for the forward swimming motion of multiple fish. A good local fish shop will advise you on what is needed.</p><p>Marras, Stefano .

41,https://www.thesprucepets.com/difference-between-chlorine-and-chloramine-1381900,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Difference Between Chlorine and Chloramine</h1>,"<h1>Difference Between Chlorine and Chloramine</h1><p>The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was enacted in 1974 to ensure safe drinking water in our homes in the United States. As a result of this law, the Environmental Protection Agency set drinking water quality standards for all public water systems across the country. These regulations require that all municipal water supplies be treated to limit bacterial growth and other hazardous contaminants.<br/>Water treatment companies can choose different disinfectant methods and for a long time, chlorine was the disinfectant of choice; however, many municipal water treatment plants have switched to chloramine. For most people, it doesn't make any difference, but to the aquarium owner, the disinfectant in the tap water is very significant.</p><h2>Chlorine </h2><p>Chlorine is a gas that is dissolved into the tap water to kill microorganisms that may inadvertently enter the city water supply piping. The concentration of chlorine required to successfully treat public water sources is high enough to be lethal to your fish. Fortunately, it is easily neutralized by one of two methods. The first option is to chemically treat the water with sodium thiosulfate. Virtually every water treatment product available at your local pet shop contains this chemical. In other words, if your water contains only chlorine, all you need to purchase is an inexpensive water treatment product to make your tap water safe for your fish.</p><p>The second chlorine removal method is based on the fact that chlorine dissipates quite rapidly into the atmosphere when the water is exposed to air. Expose water to the open air for 24 hours, and it will become chlorine-free. You can accomplish this by leaving it in open buckets or by filling the tank and letting the filter run at least one day before adding the fish. Many old-timers in the hobby remember treating aquarium water in this way. It worked quite well because at the time chloramines weren't used in public water treatment. Aerating the water (with an airstone attached to an aquarium air pump) will allow the chlorine gas to dissipate even more quickly.<br/>Sounds fairly simple? Not so fast. Since many municipal water plants have switched to chloramine, treating tap water for aquarium use has become a bit more complicated.</p><h2>Chloramine </h2><p>Chloramine is a combination of ammonia with chlorine. The ammonia binds the chlorine gas to keep it in solution longer. Unlike straight chlorine, which dissipates fairly quickly when exposed to air, chloramine remains in the water longer. That's good for the water company tasked with keeping public drinking water safe from contaminants such as bacteria. It's not so good for those of us who keep fish and want to use our tap water to fill the aquarium.</p><p>First and foremost, it means the old trick of aging water in open buckets or in a tank with a filter running won't work anymore. You can age the water for days and the chloramine will still be there. Secondly, it means you must ensure that you treat the water for ammonia as well as for chlorine. Not all aquarium water treatment products will neutralize the chloramine. Even those that claim they do aren't always fully effective in getting the job done, so choose your water treatment products carefully.</p><p>Often these products remove the chlorine portion and lock the ammonia portion, in the same fashion as Ammo-Lock. This will render the water safe for your fish, but keep in mind that your ammonia test may not be accurate, it may still indicate that the ammonia is present in the water, even though it is in a bound, non-toxic form. If you want to accurately monitor your ammonia levels, you'll need a test kit that can separately measure NH<sub>3</sub>(free ammonia) and NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>(ionized ammonia).</p><h2>Do You Have Chlorine or Chloramine in Your Water? </h2><p>The most direct way to determine what is in your tap water is to call your water company and ask what they use to treat the municipal water supply. By law, they must make the composition of your water available to you. Be aware that the city water supply company may change water sources and chemical additives at a different time of the year, depending on water temperature and rainfall amounts, or other factors.</p><p>You can always test your tap water yourself. It's wise to test your water anyway, so it's a good route to go. Test kits available that look for chlorine as well as chloramine. Or, you simply test your tap water for ammonia. If it tests positive for ammonia, chloramine is almost certainly present. Then you can choose the proper product to treat your tap water.</p><p>Another option is to bypass all testing and simply treat the tap water with a product that neutralizes both chlorine and ammonia so you cover all the bases. Regardless of what you do, it's wise to be aware of what's in your water source to ensure it's safe for your aquarium and pond fish.</p>",829

Their unconditional love gives our mental and physical health a boost, and for this reason there is much to be said about the responses humans have had to pet therapy as an alternative or supplementary treatment to help reduce stress, as well as treat a whole range of medical and emotional ailments. Dogs, cats, dolphins, and many other types of social animals have been used for years for this type of therapy, with encouraging, positive results. But what about using a fish aquarium in this way? Does aquarium pet therapy have any beneficial health merits?</p><h2>Therapeutic Benefits of Fish Tanks in Public Spaces </h2><p>People visit public places every day, and it seems more and more often that aquarium display tanks are being seen. We are hypnotized by their peaceful and serene nature, creating a calming effect for a few moments in our hectic lives. For example, have you ever been sitting impatiently and anxiously in a doctors' overcrowded office or a hospital emergency room waiting area that has had an aquarium in it? You stared into this wonderful miniature water world before your eyes and seemed less agitated and anxious. You may have felt more willing to temporarily accept that things are just the way they are, rather than get more upset or worried.</p><p>From your own experiences, no matter where the location of an aquarium you may have been seen was, did you feel this same type of stress reducing response? It's no wonder. Researchers are finding that fish aquariums, whether salt or freshwater, do have therapeutic health benefits.</p><h2>Research on Therapeutic Benefits </h2><p>There is much being done around the world to research the therapeutic benefits of aquariums, as the following reports reflect.</p><h3>Improving Alzheimer's Patients </h3><p>At Purdue University, researchers have found that displaying tanks of brightly colored fish may curtail disruptive behaviors and improve eating habits of people with Alzheimer's disease. A Purdue News August 1999 Report states that, ""Nursing Professor Nancy Edwards"" tracked 60 individuals who resided in specialized units in three Indiana nursing homes. She found that patients who were exposed to the fish tanks appeared to be more relaxed and alert, and they ate up to 21 percent more food than they had before the introduction of the fish tanks. The average increase in food consumption was 17.2 percent.""</p><h3>Helping Child Therapy </h3><h3>Lowering Blood Pressure </h3><p>You can draw your own conclusions as to the health benefits of using fish aquariums for therapy as we have, but here are some other resources that further confirm that many researchers are finding that there IS something to it!</p><h2>Stress Factors in Maintaining Aquariums </h2><p>For those of us that keep and maintain a saltwater aquarium, we expose ourselves to the stress relieving benefits it has to offer on a daily basis. However, on the other side of the coin as an aquarium keeper, you have to consider possible stress inducing factors as well.</p><p>An experienced aquarist is adept at handling aquarium problems that may arise, but when first getting started there is much to learn. You worry about getting it all set up, selecting the right filtration system and tank inhabitants, cycling the tank, hope that the fish don't get sick, and, and, and... See what we mean? It's easy to reap the stress reducing benefits of an aquarium when someone else is taking care of it and all you have to do is enjoy it. Yes, there are going to be times when an aquarium will cause some stress in your life rather than reduce it, but in our opinion it is well worth it! Once you get past the initial stages of getting started and become skilled in the art of aquarium keeping, the good benefits far out weigh the bad that you may encounter over time.</p><h2>Outsourcing Aquarium Maintenance </h2><p>If you personally feel that keeping a saltwater aquarium would be too stressful for you, there is a simple solution. Have an experienced aquarium maintenance company or person put one together for you and maintain it! There are many aquarists out there that literally thrive on and live for saltwater aquarium keeping. Why not avoid needless stress and worry by letting someone do it for you, and in turn reap the stress reducing health benefits yourself.</p><p>Did you know that aside from public display fish aquariums being good for your health, they can be applied in educational ways as well?</p>",803
43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-water-movement-1381914,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Equipment for Aquarium Water Movement</h1>,"<h1>Equipment for Aquarium Water Movement</h1><p>Water movement in the aquarium helps maintain a healthy habitat in a number of ways. Whether you are setting up a new aquarium, updating an established tank, or trying to solve a nagging problem, it's always wise to review the water movement to be sure it's meeting the needs of your fish.</p><h2>Benefits of Water Movement </h2><p>First and foremost, water movement in the aquarium is a key factor in oxygenation of the water. Oxygen exchange occurs primarily at the surface of the water and increases in proportion to the amount of water agitation. Ensuring that there is plenty of water movement will ensure your fish have sufficient oxygen. If there is ever a doubt about oxygenation, the first step to take is to increase the water movement. Often this will be the only step needed. If you are planning a new aquarium, make sure you incorporate plenty of water movement from the start. </p><p>Another key benefit of good water movement is maintaining even water temperature. If there is little or no water movement, zones of warm and cold water can form. Circulating the water will prevent temperature layering from occurring, especially in large aquariums. Using small powerheads in different locations, or spray bars will go long ways toward evening out the aquarium water temperature.</p><p>When water movement is decreased, it is not uncommon for nooks and crannies in the tank to become essentially 'dead zones'. Debris will collect in these areas, and over time can even impact beneficial bacterial colonies, not to mention becoming an eyesore. Directing water flow in these dead areas will move the debris around so it is eventually captured by the filtration system.</p><p>Last, but certainly not least, water movement is important to many species of fish. In fact, some fish require a current for optimal health, especially schooling fish. However, the converse is true for other fish species. Bettas, for instance, prefer calm water with little movement. Always study the needs of your fish, and increase water movement for only those species that need it.</p><h2>Powerheads </h2><p>Powerheads are an excellent way to create water movement in specific locations and directions. They are available in a variety of types, from large to small. Small powerheads are great for placing in dead spots where oxygenation is poor and debris tends to collect. Gentle to swift currents can be created with one or more powerheads.</p><p>Placing a powerhead near the heater will help drive heated water to other parts of the aquarium. In a tank without sufficient water movement, cool water will remain in the lower regions of the tank, while the warmer water rises to the upper strata. Water movement will ensure that the water temperature in the aquarium is fairly even across all levels within the tank.</p><p>In large tanks, several powerheads may be utilized to avoid dead spots that can occur. Even in smaller aquariums, a nano powerhead can serve a beneficial purpose, by keeping the water circulating evenly throughout the tank.</p><h2>Spray Bars </h2><p>Spray bars are a great way to move water at the all-important surface where oxygen exchange occurs. Not only does the spray distribute the filtered water over a wider area, it agitates it, thus increasing the oxygen exchange. Spray bars typically are placed horizontally near the rear of the tank, just below the surface of the water. In some situations, a spray bar may be placed vertically along one side of the tank to produce current throughout the water column. Be sure the spray bar moves the water at the surface of the aquarium, and the filter intake tube is at the bottom of the aquarium. That way, the aerated water at the surface will be moved down through the aquarium.</p><p>Generally, filters or powerheads that can be used with a spray bar will include one in the product package. However, if one is not included, becomes clogged or worn out, it's fairly easy to create your own DIY spray bar. Simply cut a PVC pipe to the length needed, plug one end with an end cap, and drill small holes along the length of the pipe. Measure the filter or powerhead outlet to get the correct diameter tube, which generally is about three-eighths of an inch.</p><h2>Bubblers and Airstones </h2><p>Airstones or bubblers, driven by an air pump, can also increase water movement, as well as add interest to the overall decor of the aquarium. Be aware that the bubbles themselves do not increase the dissolved oxygen in the water. However, the increased movement at the surface, due to bubbles rising through the water column, will improve oxygenation. The movement of the bubbles upward pushes water to the surface where it will by oxygenated, and will also help break up thermal layers, thus evening out the water temperature in the aquarium. A variety of attractive bubblers, some that even incorporate special lighting, are available at your local fish store.</p>",812

However, dry flake foods do provide the nutrients fish would find in a natural diet, along with supplements to ensure good health. Here's what you should consider when choosing flake foods for your fish.</p><h2>A Hungry Fish Is a Healthy Fish </h2><p>It is best when feeding your fish, to do it in small amounts, not more food than all your fish can completely eat in about five minutes. Do not make the mistake of overfeeding when you are feeding your fish, allowing flakes to remain on the bottom! Fish will rarely eat left over flake food on the bottom of the aquarium, and scavengers would have eaten it if they were still hungry. </p><p>Until you get a feel for how much flake food your fish will eat, you may over-feed the aquarium. This is a problem, unless you take quick action. You must either net the excess food out of the aquarium, or siphon it completely off the bottom and out of the tank.</p><p>A new fish keeper is faced with a wide variety of foods in the average tropical fish retail establishment. On average, you will find 10 to 20 formulas and brands of flake foods, another dozen or so granular foods, a variety of pellet foods and a freezer full of frozen foods, all marketed for feeding your fish.</p><p>It can be very confusing, but just remember most aquarium fish are omnivorous. These fish eat food of animal protein origin as well as plant origin.</p><h2>Look For Protein Source and Content </h2><p>Protein is the essential nutrient in the fish diet. However, like all good things; too much, too little, or the wrong type of protein can cause problems. The best protein comes from, you guessed it, other fish. The ingredients are listed in order of the greatest quantity first. Select a food that has the first few ingredients listed as fish meal, shrimp, and other seafood on the label. Fish don't need much carbohydrate in the diet, so avoid foods with a large number of grains, or grains listed as the first ingredients.</p><p>Food for young fish should have 35 to 45 percent protein. For older fish, less protein is better. Too much protein for mature fish can make them fat and causes fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis). Look at the Guaranteed Analysis on the food label to see what the protein content is in the food.</p><h2>Keep it Fresh </h2><p>Nutrients in flake food deteriorate over time; in fact they deteriorate rather quickly. It's best to only buy what you can use in one month or less. Select a variety of foods, and rotate for each feeding. This gives you a higher chance of supplying the proper nutrients, while introducing variety into the diet. Using freeze dried, frozen or pelleted food along with the flake food provides great nutrition for all types of fish.</p><p><br/>Some manufacturers package several types of flakes in a single can. All you have to do is twist the top to get a different selection. It's a great way to offer your fish variety without purchasing multiple cans of flakes. I highly recommend trying one of them.</p><h2>Not Just for Vegetarians </h2><h2>Pellets and Sticks </h2><p>The larger the fish the larger its appetite and its mouth. Naturally, large fish prefer something larger to eat. Floating and sinking pellets or sticks are a good choice for larger fish such as cichlids. You will find them in various sizes, designed to match the size of the fish. Become familiar with what your fish eat in nature. Some large fish, such as the Silver Dollar, are vegetarians even though they look like meat lovers. Be sure to offer them some vegetable pellets.</p><h2>Other Foods </h2><p>In addition to flakes and pellets, there are also freeze-dried foods such as krill, tubifex, and shrimp. Tubifex generally comes in cubes, which can be firmly pressed to the inside glass of the tank. This gives smaller fish a chance to compete with the larger fish for the food. You'll enjoy seeing them tear into it - they almost look like a pack of wolves. Another great option is frozen food cubes. Frozen foods are made from a variety of ingredients, such as brine shrimp, worms, vegetables and algae. These are very nutritious - and the fish find them delicious.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>When introducing new foods, watch closely to see if it's eaten. Any uneaten food should be removed from the aquarium, or it might foul the water.</p><p><br/>Feed your fish a varied diet consisting of a flake food as the main ingredient, as well as a occasional meal of freeze-dried, frozen, or pelleted foods and you can't go wrong. Your fish will be healthy, colorful and will grow robustly.</p>",795

The fact is, with simple lighting and the right choice in easy-to-grow plants, every aquarium can have great live plants without much trouble at all. If your intention is to grow exotic rare species of plants, it's quite another story, but with the common growth-oriented aquatic plants described in this article, no special expertise is required.</p><h2>Good Lighting Requirements </h2><p>Light is necessary for the photosynthesis required for the health and growth of all aquarium plants. Proper lighting enables the plants to absorb the carbon dioxide gases the fish breathe out. Too much light will cause the appearance of microscopic life known as algae. Too much light and a type of floating algae can grow that will turn the water green; too little light and plants suffer; but with the right level of light, some small spots of green algae appear on the surface of rocks and sides of a glass aquarium. Some algae are desirable, fish nibble on it, and it adds to the natural look of a healthy community aquarium. </p><p>In general, if an aquarium is near a sunny window, it may only need 5 hours of artificial light per day. But in direct sunlight, the algae growth will be out of control, even without any artificial light at all. For best results, an aquarium should be placed in an area where sunlight never reaches it directly. Artificial lighting should be on for a minimum of 8 hours per day but can stay on 10 to 12 hours if this enables better viewing in the evening for the hobbyist.</p><h2>Replace Incandescent Lighting </h2><p>If you are using old-fashioned incandescent lighting, the lighting should be about 25 Watts per square foot of aquarium water. However, incandescent lighting is obsolete for several reasons: </p><h2>Fluorescent Lighting vs. LED</h2><p>Another type of available lighting for aquariums is fluorescent and compact fluorescent lighting. If a fluorescent lighting fixture is used, be sure to use the bulbs specifically rated for aquarium plant growth. The light spectrum needed for plant growth is entirely different than a fluorescent bulb one would find in the kitchen or office lighting. Do not use fluorescent light bulbs from a hardware store; they may fit within the fixture, but they are not ideal for growing aquarium plants.</p><p>LED lighting has made amazing progress in the growth of exotic plants with some higher-end fixtures, but even the most inexpensive LED fixtures specifically made for aquariums will be adequate for successful and healthy plant growth in a community aquarium.</p><h2>Advantages of LED Lighting</h2><p>Thomas R. Reich, PhD</p><p>Specialty lighting can be fun for effect within a community aquarium.</p><h2>Timing Considerations</h2><p>It is advisable to use a timer to turn lights on at a set time and off at a set time every day. Consistency is necessary for best plant growth and for fish to develop a regular life cycle. Can you leave lights on 24 hours a day without killing your fish? Yes. Is it advisable or even humane? No! Setting the lighting to be on at least 8 hours to 12 hours per day is best, depending on the home schedule of the viewers. The community aquarium is there for your viewing enjoyment, so set the light cycle to be on when observers are more apt to be in the room.</p><p>Is it okay to turn on the lights if a visitor comes at an odd hour and wants to see the community aquarium in all its lighted glory? Yes, it is okay occasionally, but remember; it will take 20 to 30 minutes for the fish to fully ""wake up"" and become as active as they are in a normal light cycle. It is important to remember: a well-run community aquarium simulates nature as closely as possible. In nature, the sun comes up every day and goes down every day, and the sun does not come on in the middle of the night. Remember this when deciding to turn on the aquarium light out of the cycle. It is okay sometimes, but it is not natural to your fish and their life.</p><h2>Why Plants Die </h2><h2>Recomended Easy Plants </h2><p>This list makes no attempt to be complete or to go into the various species of each plant suggested. Some have roots, some have bulbs and others are bunch plants. What the plants on this list do have in common is they are all easy to grow and pleasing to the eye!</p><h2>Read More on Growing Aquarium Plants </h2><p>Aquarium plants can become a major part of aquarium keeping for many hobbyists; there are societies for aquarium plant fanciers as well as books and websites that specialize in the joys of growing aquarium plants.</p>",782
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-should-i-feed-my-fish-1378746,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Determining How Much to Feed Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Determining How Much to Feed Aquarium Fish</h1><p>Overfeeding is the most common mistake fish owners make, and it can lead to a multitude of serious problems in the aquarium. Overfeeding clogs the filter, and breaks down into toxins that are harmful to fish. This is why fish food packaging includes clear warnings regarding the dangers of overfeeding.</p><p>In nature, fish search for food when are hungry, but will also eat whenever food is available. If food sources are plentiful, they will eat several times a day. On the other hand, if food sources are scarce, fish might go for days between meals with no ill effects. For this reason, fish are very opportunistic and will eat whenever they have a chance. Whenever you offer them food, aquarium fish will usually gobble it up even if they aren't in need of nutrition. Keep that in mind the next time your fish appears to ""beg"" for food. Fish quickly learn who brings the food to the tank and will jump at the chance to be fed, even if they are not in dire need.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Feeding your fish too often or offering them too much food can lead to several problems. Both excessive digestive wastes and uneaten food can pollute the water and create high ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate levels, and lower the oxygen level as well as lowering the pH levels. If your water tests show high nitrate levels, it is very likely because you are overfeeding your fish. Further, excessive food floating in the water can clog filters, causing the water to become toxic.</p><h2>How Often </h2><p>The correct frequency of feeding will vary based on the species of fish. In general, most fish do quite well on one or two feedings per day. Most fish require 16 to 24 hours to fully digest the food they eat, so a once-a-day feeding is quite sufficient. However, some owners prefer to feed their fish very lightly twice a day. Whether you feed one or two times per day, the key is to keep the feedings very small. The timing is not critical, with the exception of species that are nocturnal feeders, such as certain catfish. If you have nocturnal fish in your aquarium, be sure to feed them just before turning the lights out at night.</p><p>There are some exceptions to the once-per-day feeding rule. Herbivores (vegetarians) need to eat frequently because they do not have large stomachs to hold a lot of food. In nature, they graze all day long on plants that are readily available and have no need to gorge opportunistically. These species should be given several small feedings a day or provided with live plants they can nibble on constantly.</p><p>Also, newly hatched fry and young fish not fully grown require more frequent feedings of special foods designed for fry. Usually, three or four feedings a day are necessary for fry.</p><h2>How Much </h2><p>As for how much food to feed, a good rule of thumb is to feed no more than the fish will consume completely in five to ten minutes. When in doubt, underfeed! You can always give them another small feeding if necessary. However, if you overfeed, the uneaten food will produce wastes that can be harmful to the fish. In the event that you do overfeed, promptly remove the uneaten food from the tank using a siphon or net. If you see rotting food hovering near the bottom of the tank, it is a clear sign you are overfeeding. This can lead to elevated ammonia levels in the water and serious health consequences for your fish. Like any species, overfed fish may become obese and bloated.</p><p>Store your fish food in a cool place to maintain its vitamin value and ensure your fish get the maximum nutritional value from the feedings. It's also best to buy small amounts, a month's supply at a time, to prevent the food from losing its nutritional value before being used up feeding your fish.</p><p>As a final note, keep in mind that not only the amount but the type of food is important. Research fish species to determine which type of food is appropriate for the fish you keep. Some fish foods are specific to species, such as algae wafers for bottom-feeding herbivores, while others may be tailored to freshwater fish or saltwater species. Whatever food you choose, make sure it is balanced to provide the vitamins, protein, and minerals your fish need. Small amounts of good nutritional food are much better for your fish than large amounts of cheap food.</p>",772
47,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-water-ph-1378801,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>Aquarium Water pH Maintenance</h1>,"<h1>Aquarium Water pH Maintenance</h1><h2>What Is pH? </h2><p>The term pH stands for ""power of Hydrogen,"" and since ""H"" is the atomic symbol for the hydrogen element, the ""H"" in pH is always capitalized. The pH is the acid-base balance of a solution and is measured in a range from 1 to 14.</p><h2>What Is Normal pH? </h2><p>There is no ""normal"" pH that applies to all fish. Because fish originate in ponds, rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans that have different pH levels, the optimum pH levels for fish varies by species. Saltwater fish prefer a basic pH of 8.0 or above. African cichlids often come from lakes that have a pH value above 8.0. Tropical fish from the Rio Negro in Brazil may live in acidic water with a pH of 5.5 or lower.</p><p>Keep in mind that pH is not static; it changes over time. In fact, it may even change over the course of a single day. In nature, due to plant respiration and photosynthesis, pH typically drops at night and rises during the daytime. The pH may change as new fish are added or removed, as water is added or changed, and as the biological processes change in the aquarium.</p><h2>Preferred pH of Common Freshwater Fish </h2><h2>How Important Is pH? </h2><p>Significant pH changes are particularly hard on young and sick fish. In a number of species of fish, breeding occurs only within a specific pH range. </p><p>If you are planning a new aquarium it's wise to know the pH of your water source, so you know beforehand if it is compatible with the species of fish you want to keep. Some fish such as Discus, and certain other cichlids, thrive in very narrow ranges of pH, which should be taken into consideration when setting up their aquarium.</p><p>When moving fish from one aquarium to another it is important to match the pH levels. Sudden changes in pH account for many fish losses that occur when fish are brought home from a pet shop. Neon tetras are particularly sensitive to sudden changes in pH, and can easily be shocked when moved.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Changes in the pH, especially sudden changes, can prove harmful or even fatal to fish. As the pH rises, it increases the toxicity of chemicals such as ammonia. It is an important factor to monitor while breaking in a new aquarium.</p><h2>How Often Should I Check pH? </h2><p>The pH should be tested at least once a month, though preferably every two weeks, to allow for the detection of trends before they become a problem. Keep test results in a logbook for future reference. Remember that because pH can vary based on time of day, testing at different times of day can yield different results even though nothing is wrong. For this reason, testing should take place at the same time of day, preferably in the afternoon.</p><p>Any time there is a fish illness or death, the pH should be tested. If the tank is treated with medication, the pH should be checked when treatment is begun, on the final day of treatment, and again a week later. Perform water changes as needed when the pH starts to vary from the optimum range for the fish.</p><p>It is also wise to test your water just before purchasing new fish. Check with the shop where you are purchasing the fish to see what their water pH is. It's important that the pH of water the fish is currently in is not significantly different than the pH of your water at home (preferably within 0.2 units above or below the home pH value).</p><h2>Should pH Be Altered? </h2><p>If the fish are not thriving, or if testing shows that a trend is occurring, such as a steady drop or rise in pH, the problem should be addressed. Pet stores sell commercial products designed to raise the pH or to lower it, if necessary, to adjust the pH of your local tap water. Proactive water care is always your best bet. Performing frequent partial water changes, and vacuuming the gravel are the most important things you can do to keep water pH stable. Over time, the biological filter bacteria that break down fish wastes will utilize the alkalinity (carbonate) in the water and the pH will gradually drop (become more acidic). You can prevent this by doing water changes to remove the lower pH water and adding fresh, dechlorinated water that has higher alkalinity to raise and stabilize the pH level.</p>",740
48,https://www.thesprucepets.com/plants-safe-for-betta-fish-5210886,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>What Plants are Safe for Betta Fish?</h1>,"<h1>What Plants are Safe for Betta Fish?</h1><p>There are many benefits to including plants in your fish tank. Both live and fake plants are good additions for many different fish species. For bettas, both live and fake plants are safe, but there are a few key points to address before adding this decoration to their environment.<br/></p><h2>Are plants safe? </h2><p>In general, plants are safe for many fish, bettas included. Both live and fake plants can provide enrichment to your betta's environment, giving them places to explore, hang out and hide in. Be sure to stick with plants that are specific for aquariums. Some live plants can be toxic to fish, especially if consumed. Thankfully, bettas are not so much plant-eaters as plant-appreciators.</p><p>Fake plants can either be rooted in the substrate or attached to the sides of the tank with a suction cup. There are specialized betta ""hammocks,"" which consist of a single or cluster of leaves that can attach to the side of your tank. Other fake plants have ""roots"" that will either rest on the surface or need to be anchored by layers of substrate. When adding fake plants, it is essential to rinse them thoroughly to keep dust and debris from entering your aquarium.</p><p>Live plants come in a wide variety and grow to different levels in the aquarium. Floating plants, such as duckweed, Salvinia and frogbit, add surface contrast, and may be used by male bettas when building their bubble nests. Be sure the plants don't completely cover the water surface as bettas need to breathe air from the top of the water. Some aquatic plants grow low on the substrate, such as Java moss, and are great for filling below the swimming area of the aquarium. Tall plants, like Vallisneria and sword plants, are great planted along the back of the aquarium. Be sure that none of the plants are too spiny that might tear the betta's delicate fins, or so bushy that they impede swimming. With all live plants, be sure to quarantine them separately for at least two weeks if they have been kept with fish previously. Use this time to strengthen them with some liquid aquarium plant fertilizer.</p><h2>What plants should be avoided? </h2><p>Plants that should be avoided in betta tanks are those that can cause fin trauma. Most causes of ""fin rot"" in bettas are actually tears from objects within their environment. This can be caused by both fake and live plants, depending on their structure and exposed roots. Over-decorating with plants and causing bettas to have to swim through a network of branches can easily cause fin trauma. Depending on the size and shape of your tank, you may need to limit the number of decorations to ensure your betta has enough room to swim comfortably.</p><p>The best method to test for pointy plant parts is to run your hand or a sheet of tissue paper across the surface of your new plant. If it tears the paper or you can feel sharp edges on your skin, it is too sharp for a betta. Pointy structural parts, such as stems, can be easily trimmed with a pair of nail clippers. Problematic attachment points can be covered with aquarium-safe silicone.</p><h2>What types of plants are safe? </h2><p>The following plants are the best choices for betta tanks.</p><h3>Betta Hammock </h3><p>These artificial leaves are beloved by many bettas. Either a single leaf or a small cluster, these plants attach to the side of your fish tank by a suction cup, allowing your betta a safe and secluded spot to enjoy a nice rest. Try adding a few at different heights to see which your fish prefers.</p><h3>Anacharis </h3><p>This live plant, eagerly eaten by many fish species such as goldfish, is a slender and soft addition to the aquarium. Since it is very compact, you can add a few stalks together and it can be anchored in the gravel or left floating. The soft leaves are very betta friendly and it grows well with little care.</p><h3>Silk ""Betta-Safe"" Plants </h3><h3>Camboba or Carolina Fanwort </h3><p>This short, bushy plant is a good ground cover to intermediate size plant for aquariums. It fits the bettas' requirements for soft leaves. It is, however, highly recommended to anchor this live plant rather than leave it floating. The stems are stronger than they look and although are not abrasive, they can easily trap a betta.</p>",725

Bigger aquariums are easier to maintain, and you can even keep more fish! Here are the steps to successfully transfer everything from your smaller, established aquarium to a new larger one.</p><h2>Preparing the Old Aquarium for Exit </h2><p>If the aquarium has recently gone through a major event such as fish death, a replacement of the filter media, or new fish being added, it's important to wait a few weeks before undertaking this aquarium switch. This will allow the old aquarium to stabilize.</p><p>Beneficial bacteria colonize not only the filter media but also the gravel bed and all other hard surfaces of the aquarium, such as rocks and decorations. All fish, as well as all decor, equipment, and gravel, can be transferred without washing, but it's advisable to leave most of the old water behind.</p><h2>Setting Up the New Aquarium </h2><p>To support the new system, you'll need a bigger filter and heater. New equipment must be rated for the larger tank volume as the old ones won't be powerful enough for the new size. If you plan to use the old filter in the new tank, leave it running on the smaller tank to keep its beneficial bacteria alive.</p><p>Set up the new tank by filling it only three-quarters full of water. That will leave enough displacement volume to handle the new equipment, additional gravel, and any decorations. Also, run an air stone in the new tank to help dissipate any dissolved gases that may be present in your water supply. Let the new system run for 24 hours.</p><h2>Testing the Water to Match </h2><p>Both tanks will need to be heated at the same time to ensure equal temperature conditions so as to avoid shocking the fish. Later, your old heater can serve as your backup as aquarium heaters sometimes fail.</p><p>Test and record the pH and water temperature of the old aquarium. After 24 hours of settling, test the pH and temperature in the new aquarium; compare your findings. Do not proceed with the transfer if there is a difference of more than two-tenths of a point of pH level or more than a slight difference in water temperature between the two aquariums.</p><p>Of these two parameters, pH is the more critical. Adjust the pH of the new aquarium up or down just as you would in the old one.</p><h2>Moving the Gravel and Filtration </h2><p>Use a clean cup to transfer the gravel from the old tank to the new one. Next, move all the rocks and decorations. If you plan to use the old filter in the new tank, move it at this time.</p><p>The filter from the old tank has beneficial bacterial colonies in the filter media. By running both the old and the new filter for a few weeks, you'll introduce plenty of beneficial bacteria into the new system. This extra filtration will also be helpful as the new aquarium becomes established.</p><p>Make sure all filtration is running before moving the fish. Treat the new aquarium as you would any new tank, which means that you should test the water for both ammonia and nitrite daily and perform partial water changes until they are at zero.</p><h2>Moving Your Fish  </h2><p>If the pH and the water temperature match exactly, you can transfer fish without needing to bag them; use a clear plastic pitcher with a barrier on top. Otherwise, you can bag the fish and acclimate them the same way you would with any fish you purchase and bring home.</p><p>To catch each fish, hold the pitcher underwater and use a small net to gently guide the fish inside. Firmly hold a cover over the top so fish cannot jump out, then slowly lower the pitcher into the new tank, but do not poor or rotate the pitcher; let each fish get its bearings and swim out of the pitcher on its own. Once you have the fish transferred over to the new aquarium, make sure that all of the components (heater, filter, lights) are working properly and that the water quality stays in the correct range. Then you can enjoy your bigger, better aquarium!</p>",711

Just like the painted, dyed, and man-made hybrid fish before them, they quickly became popular among consumers eager for something new and different. The glow fish's bright colors made them instant best sellers. While they don't actually glow in the dark, their bright colors do fluoresce under blue light and make them quite colorful, just like saltwater reef fish.<br/>Now, besides zebra danios (), there are tiger barbs () and tetras ( that have been genetically modified to carry the bright color genes. Taiwan's Council of Agriculture revealed that it has also successfully produced transgenic convict cichlids () and angelfish ( ).</p><h2>How It Started </h2><p>It started off innocently enough when a professor at National Taiwan University extracted a fluorescent protein from a jellyfish and inserted it into the genome of a zebrafish egg. He was hoping to make the organs of the zebrafish easier to see when he studied them, but to his amazement, the entire fish began glowing under blue lighting.</p><p>Later he presented a slide of his glowing fish at a conference, where it captured the interest of a tropical fish production company. Seeing its value in the tropical fish retail market, they agreed to fund the professor's experiments in exchange for use of his techniques. Using different colored jellyfish proteins allowed new colors to be produced. The rest, as they say, is history.</p><p>The glowing fish, named TK-1 by its creator, soon was being sold in the Asian market. By late 2003, sales had expanded to the United States. Not everyone was in favor of marketing the fish, and considerable debate is raging over the ethics and safety of marketing genetically altered fish. But a new species of glow fish and colors are being developed and the demand for the fish by aquarists is growing.</p><h2>Sales Ban </h2><p>The FDA has stated that the genetically engineered fish are no more threat to the environment than unaltered fish, and therefore do not warrant regulation. California wasn't about to let the matter pass, and promptly chose to block sales of glow fish. The regulations were lifted in 2015 due to the findings of the Food and Drug Administration and the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services that the fish posed no environmental risk. GloFish are now legal in California for importation and commercial sale. Canada, Australia, and Europe also had originally banned the fish, but now they are available for sale.</p><p>The primary arguments against the fish are environmental and ethical concerns. There was fear that if genetically altered fish were released into local waterways they could harm the environment, or animals might consume them and suffer side effects. Many feel that selling genetic alerted fish is not only ethically wrong, but it sends the wrong message to children. Others feel that any alteration of a living creature is an abuse of the power we have over life and consider it nothing short of biological pollution. Still others express concerns that if glowing fish becomes popular, what will be next - glow in the dark cats and dogs? Where will the line be drawn?</p><h2>Proponents </h2><p>Meanwhile, proponents say the fish is completely safe and is an attractive alternative to keeping colorful, but more expensive and difficult to care for, saltwater fish. They cite reports showing that if glow fish were to find themselves in natural waters they would be unable to survive. The bright colors of the glow fish will actually make them easy prey in the wild if they do get out into natural waterways.</p><p>The other advantage of glow fish over other forms of colored fish is that the glow fish is created in the egg and the fish that hatch will reproduce naturally and pass the glow coloring on to their offspring. The dyed, painted, injected or otherwise artificially colored fish that are sometimes available in fish stores are actually harmed in the coloring process, the colors are not permanent and will gradually fade, and the colors to do not pass on to the offspring.</p>",709
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bacterial-bloom-1380092,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>How to Fix Bacterial Bloom in Your Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How to Fix Bacterial Bloom in Your Aquarium</h1><p>While perfectly clean, clear water for fish is the ideal situation for most aquarium owners, sometimes other circumstances arise that need to be treated. A common occurrence is bacterial bloom: Also known as bacterial blossom, bacterial bloom can create cloudy or milky water in your aquarium that can be so severe that it becomes difficult to see the fish.</p><h3>What Is a Bacterial Bloom?</h3><p>Bacterial bloom is a condition in which a sudden increase in the number of bacterial colonies occurs, specifically bacteria that are suspended in the water column. The bacteria grow so rapidly that, collectively, they become visible to the naked eye, causing the water to become murky in appearance.</p><p>This condition most often is seen in a newly started aquarium, but can also occur in a tank in which there is has been an increase in the nutrients in the water, particularly nitrates and phosphates. This can happen if fish die and are not promptly removed, or if plants die off and are not removed. Excessive feeding of fish without cleaning the debris can also cause a sharp increase in nutrients that result in bacterial bloom.</p><h2>Part of the Nitrogen Cycle </h2> <p>It is more common that the heterotrophs are seen in bacterial blooms, not the trusted autotroph nitrifiers.</p><p>It is the heterotrophs that are primarily responsible for creating the ""bio-film"" (slimy residue found on the tank walls and ornaments) which builds up in the ""new water"" aquarium.</p><p>The heterotrophs are generally bigger than the autotrophs and therefore don't attach themselves to surfaces with the same ease. They also reproduce much more quickly. Heterotrophs can reproduce in around 15 to 20 minutes, whereas autotrophs can take up to 24 hours to reproduce.</p><p>In a newly set-up aquarium, the heterotrophs get to work quicker than the autotrophs, causing the ""cycling bloom"" so often seen. Blooms are almost certainly heterotrophic if they are caused by a build-up of organic waste in the substrate, which most, if not all, are.</p><p>Bacterial blooms are common in tanks with apparently no organics present (for example, where all that is in the tank is water and ammonia for a fishless cycle). This is caused by the dechlorination of the water suddenly enabling the water to support bacterial populations. The heterotrophs immediately get to work on the organics in the water itself. The severity of the bloom and even whether a bloom happens at all is dependent upon the level of organics contained in the water supply.</p><h2>The Effects </h2><p>Most of the bacteria in the aquarium are aerobic, as it is an oxygen dominated environment and these bacteria require lots of oxygen. When the heterotrophic bacteria bloom into the water column and switch to their aerobic state, this is a big drain on the oxygen content of the water.</p><p>Oxygen deprivation is the only risk to the fish during a bacterial bloom, as the heterotrophs themselves are harmless to fish. Fish may be gasping for air at the surface of the water during this part of the nitrogen cycle, so good advice is to increase aeration!</p><p>Why do bacterial blooms occur? The main reasons: Overfeeding, dead fish or dead plant matter will cause a rise in the reproduction of the heterotrophs in order to break down the organic waste, they reproduce too quickly to be able to attach themselves to a surface and this causes a bacterial bloom.</p><p>As the ammonia production increases due to the increased mineralization, the nitrifiers are slow to catch up and an ammonia spike occurs until the autotrophs reproduce enough to take care of it. Contrary to popular belief, bacterial blooms cause an ammonia spike, not the other way around.</p><p>It is unclear whether the autotrophic nitrifiers ever bloom into the water column or if they simply multiply too slowly to cause this effect.</p><h2>A Last Tip </h2><p>Regular partial water changes and good tank maintenance will usually prevent severe bacterial blooms. In new tanks, the bloom will dissipate as the nitrogen cycle becomes established and stabilizes.</p>",682

Gravel vacuum tube sizes typically range from 8 to 12 inches long. Some have a slanted end, while others are flat. I personally prefer the slanted end, as I've found it works better for getting into tight spots and corners. However, it's truly a matter of personal preference, as both end styles work the same. The key is that the tube diameter that is placed into the tank is very large diameter compared to the hose that extends out of the aquarium into the bucket. This allows the suction to lift the gravel into the large diameter tube to remove trapped debris, but not high enough to get sucked into the smaller diameter hose. The water flows out the narrower tubing into a bucket or drain.</p><h2>Mini Siphon</h2><p>Mini siphons work exactly the same as standard siphons but are designed for mini tanks, fish bowls, and nano tanks. Typically they have a tube that is approximately 5 inches in length. The hose is also shorter than standard siphons. They are sometimes sold in packs of three, so they can be dedicated to a specific tank, thus avoiding the transfer of pathogens from one tank to another. However, if your tanks are properly maintained, this should not be an issue.</p><h2>Long Siphon</h2><p>Longer than average siphons are designed for large, deep tanks. The tubes are usually 15 to 18 inches in length and have a much longer hose than standard siphons, often 25 feet or more in length. The reason for the extra hose length is to accommodate the tank depth. A longer hose helps with managing the volume of water removed from a larger tank. If a bucket were used when removing water from a large tank, it would be necessary to frequently stop and empty the buckets. A long hose allows it to be run to a floor drain, or even outside to drain.</p><h2>Self Priming Siphon</h2><p>This is a feature that can be present on a standard style of siphon, and one that I highly recommend. Instead of struggling to prime the siphon but sucking on the end of the hose, often resulting in a mouthful of water, the self-priming siphon merely has to be pumped to get the water flow started. It may add a bit to the price, but is worth it.</p><h2>Water Driven Siphon</h2><p>One of the more popular styles of aquarium siphon is the type that is attached to a faucet, using the stream of water to create a suction that pulls the water through the siphon. The water then goes directly into the sink and down the drain, eliminating the need for dragging buckets around. This style also can be switched to work in reverse, pushing water into the tank to refill it, so water doesn't have to be replaced into the aquarium with buckets, either. Be sure to add a water conditioning product to remove chlorine from the tap water when refilling the aquarium.</p><p>The well known ""Python"" brand is the most commonly seen product of this type, and is marketed with different hose lengths, some as long as 75 feet. This type of siphon is pricey, but if you have large tanks, it is well worth the investment.</p><h2>Filter Driven Siphon</h2><p>Another style of power-driven siphon is one driven by a filter, either a hang on the side filter or canister filter. The hose is attached to the inlet tube of the filter, and the siphon tube used to suction debris in the usual fashion. The debris-laden water passes through the filter, and clean water is returned to the tank through the filter outlet. Obviously, this requires a fairly strong filter, and the filter will need to be cleaned after vacuuming the tank gravel, due to the extra debris being collected by the filter media. However, it makes tank cleaning quicker and cleaner than using buckets or stringing hoses through the house.</p><h2>Battery Powered Siphon</h2><p>Still another style of power drive siphon is battery operated ones. These siphons suck water out of the tank, capturing debris in a filter media or sock, then return the clean water into the tank. They are useful for light cleanings, such as after feeding time. Some models having a filter completely contained in the siphon, while others have a filter sock that fits over the outlet. Some lower priced models allow fine particulate matter to pass through the filter sock, but creative owners have found ways to improve the filtering by using nylon hosiery to better filter the fine debris.</p>",767
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cloudy-aquarium-water-1378803,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Filters,<h1>How to Deal With Cloudy Aquarium Water</h1>,"<h1>How to Deal With Cloudy Aquarium Water</h1><p>The issue of cloudy water can be frustrating for many aquarium owners, and often, there are multiple causes, from bacterial blossom to excessive nutrients. Based on the color and circumstances under which cloudy water appears, it usually can be pinpointed to a couple of basic causes.</p><p>We break down several causes for cloudy aquariums below to help you determine what is dirtying your fish tank.</p><h2>White or Grayish Water </h2><h3>Gravel Residue </h3><p>If the water is cloudy immediately or within an hour or two of filling the tank, it's probably due to insufficiently washed gravel. Drain the tank and rinse the gravel until the water runs clear. That should resolve the problem.</p><h3>Dissolved Constituents </h3><p>If washing the gravel doesn't solve the problem, the next most likely cause of cloudy water in a newly filled tank is a high level of dissolved constituents, such as phosphates, silicates, or heavy metals. If you test the water, you'll likely find that the pH is high (alkaline). In these cases, treating the water with conditioners will often resolve the problem. Another option, which has many benefits beyond resolving cloudy water, is to use RO (Reverse Osmosis) water. Your local fish shop may sell it or sell units capable of making RO water.</p><h3>Bacterial Blossom </h3><p>Often, cloudy water doesn't appear the instant an aquarium is set up. Instead, it appears days, weeks, or even months later. The cause is usually due to bacterial bloom. As the new aquarium goes through the initial break-in cycle, it is not unusual for the water to become cloudy or at least a little hazy. It will take several weeks to several months to establish bacterial colonies that can clear waste from the water. Over time, that cloudiness will resolve itself. Decaying plants or excess food that remains uneaten can also cause the milky water seen in bacterial bloom.</p><p>Regardless of the cause, don't panic over bacterial blooms. Keeping the aquarium very clean by removing debris such as decaying plants and uneaten food, vacuuming the gravel regularly, and performing partial water changes will quickly resolve most cases of bacterial bloom. Cut back feeding to every second or third day, which will reduce excess food decay. If there are particles of debris in the water that you are unable to remove via water changes and vacuuming, a flocculant may be used to clear them away. Flocculates cause particles of debris to clump together so they can easily be removed by the filter (be sure to clean your filter so it's working at peak efficiency). Flocculates are generally marketed as water clarifiers and may be found at your fish shop.</p><h2>Green Water </h2><p>Green water is a no-brainer. It's due to algae growth. Getting rid of it is the hard part, but if you know the cause, it's easier to cure.</p><h3>Too Much Light </h3><p>The most obvious cause and the easiest one to cure is too much light. Placing the aquarium in direct sunlight or leaving the lights on too long will result in algae growth. Reduce the amount of time the lights are on, and move the aquarium to a location out of direct sunlight.</p><h3>Excess Nutrients </h3><p>Nutrients such as phosphates and nitrates also support the algae growth and must also be reduced to successfully battle algae. A water change will give some immediate relief but probably won't resolve the problem completely. It's important to deal with phosphates and nitrates at their source to rid yourself of them.</p><h3>Phosphates </h3><p>Phosphates come from two sources decaying matter such as fish food, and from the water source itself. Testing your tap water for phosphates will let you know if you have a problem with your water source. If your water naturally has a high level of phosphate, you will need to use RO water or a phosphate remover to treat the water. Reducing the amount of food you give your fish, and changing to a brand that is lower in.</p><h3>Nitrates </h3><p>Nitrates naturally rise in the aquarium over time as a byproduct of fish wastes. The only way to remove them is to perform a water change. Make sure your filter is kept clean and is adequate for your tank size. Also, make sure you have not overstocked your aquarium, or you will constantly battle rising nitrate levels.</p><p>A vast majority of cases of cloudy water can be resolved by weekly 10 to 15 percent water changes, keeping the gravel very clean, and using good quality food.</p>",730
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-are-these-tiny-white-worms-1378753,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Pests,<h1>What Are Those Tiny White Worms in My Fish Tank?</h1>,"<h1>What Are Those Tiny White Worms in My Fish Tank?</h1><p>Any aquarium hobbyist that has noticed tiny white worms in their fish tank likely has one of two issues they need to address. The more common worm, the Detritus Worm, is found in many aquariums, and any overpopulation can be fixed with proper maintenance. The less common Planaria worms are a more complex problem.</p><p>Before making any changes to your tank, be positive about which white worm you're dealing with. Only then can you know if the careful use of a de-wormer or just a good cleaning is what is required. Misinformation about the correct use of de-wormers and overuse of de-wormers often leads to harming or killing fish by mistake.</p><h2>What Are Detritus Worms? </h2><p>Detritus worms are annelid worms; this is the phylum that includes the segmented worms such as earthworms, tubifex worms, and leeches. They look like thin, pointy, white-brown strings that wiggle through the water and between pebbles. Detritus worms are detritivores, meaning that they only eat decomposing plant and animal waste material; they will not harm your fish.</p><p>It is not uncommon for an aquarium to have detritus worms, as they can be introduced through a variety of means. For instance, they may have come in with a new fish or plant, and may even have been present in any gravel swapped in from another tank.</p><p>Quite often, detritus worms are not even seen. They tend to live in between the pebbles of gravel where they eat the debris left over from feeding or deposited by your fish. You may only notice them when they get sucked up when cleaning the substrate with a gravel vacuum. Detritus worms may actually be a beneficial symbiotic organism in your aquarium, as they help to keep your substrate clean.</p><h2>Causes of Detritus Worms </h2><p>When you see detritus worms coming out of the gravel frequently, that means a problem has occurred in your tank. It can be shocking when your normally clean water becomes filled with hundreds, if not thousands, of tiny white worms, especially if you don't know what caused the bloom. But it is important to treata detritus worm issue with de-wormers or any medications; these will not take care of the problem and may cause an inadvertent fish kill.</p><p>An overabundance of annelid worms can occur when aquarium maintenance has been lacking. Insufficient cleaning schedules or overfeeding of fish can cause detritus worms to reproduce rapidly and become a nuisance. Reduced dissolved oxygen or low pH levels (both are symptoms of unclean water) will cause detritus worms to seek more oxygen. The worms will flee their gravel home, traveling up the water column toward the surface.</p><h2>How to Get Rid of Detritus Worms </h2><p>Worm removal begins by giving your tank a thorough cleaning. Use a gravel vacuum and change the water to remove the majority of the detritus worms and also their food source. Secondly, be sure to check your filtration system for any issues. As proper waste removal is required to keep worms at bay, a well-maintained filtering system is essential to their prevention.</p><p>Going forward, regularly clean the substrate, review your feeding practice, and check that your aquarium is not overstocked with fish. Ensure that they are getting enough proper food without over feeding, which creates too much waste.</p><h2>What Are Planaria Worms? </h2><p>Planaria (singular, planarian) worms are not as common as detritus worms, but they are much harder to remove. These are flatworms; most are brought in with pond plants, especially if acquired from a local pond or natural water source. If you've introduced those recently and then noticed white flatworms, chemical treatment is required.</p><p>Planaria are flatworms in the class Turbellaria; they are found in both freshwater and saltwater environments the world over. They are quite small, but if you can examine them closely enough, you'll see eyespots as well as protrusions on both sides of their widened heads. Quite often, these are the worms that are crawling across the glass inside an aquarium.</p><p>They are related to flukes and tapeworms, and are evolutionarily more ancient than the Annelid Worms (which are not ""flat"" worms). These ancient worms are asexual animals, meaning they can reproduce without mating. Even after cutting one into pieces, a new worm will form from each piece.</p><p>What makes these worms problematic is that they are both scavengers and carnivores. Although they will not harm your healthy fish, they love to feast on fish eggs and therefore are dangerous if you are breeding egg-laying fish. They may also prey on gills and eyes of weakened adults.</p><h2>Causes of Planaria </h2><p>If you do indeed have a planaria problem, it's a serious issue. While detritus worms can number in the thousands, Planaria troubles are often caused by just a few flatworms that are difficult to locate. This is why getting rid of planaria requires chemical treatments. But as chemicals may also harm your fish population, you'll want to be absolutely sure of the presence of planaria before seeking the solution.</p><h2>How to Get Rid of Planaria </h2><p>Thoroughly research each of the following chemical products before using them to predetermine if they will be safe for your species of fish. Vulnerable invertebrate species like snails and shrimp should be removed. Sharks, silverfish, lionfish, piranhas, bottom feeders, and certain scaleless and fishes may also be sensitive to some worm eradication treatments. Any worms on these fish must be removed manually using blunt tweezers, or with a quick salt or freshwater dip.</p><p>With all de-wormers, be sure to use the exact recommended dosage from the manufacturer. Too much can cause a fish kill. Also, these products require strict adherence to safe handling instructions.</p><p>All of these products can be found at American Aquarium Products, which also has information about their safe handling and application.</p>",979
55,https://www.thesprucepets.com/brown-aquarium-algae-1378629,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Pests,<h1>How to Remove Brown Algae From Your Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How to Remove Brown Algae From Your Aquarium</h1><h2>Prevention Measures for This Common Occurrence in New Fish Tanks</h2><p>Brown patches on the gravel or glass of the tank is a kind of film known as a Silica Algae or Brown Algae. Once established, it can rapidly coat most surfaces of the aquarium's interior with a thin, dark brown coating.</p><p>This problem is especially common in new aquariums, which may cause concern for people new to fish keeping. The good news is that this issue is pretty easy to clean up; for the most part, it is easily removed. It is also relatively easy to stop brown algae from even growing in your aquarium if you know the cause. A few preventative measures will have your tank looking great and algae-free.</p><h2>Many Brown-Colored Algaes </h2><p>The true Brown Algaes, comprised of the Class Phaeophyceae, are a large group of multi-cellular algaes, including many of the seaweeds in cold marine waters, such as kelp. These are not the types of algae that are growing in your aquarium!</p><p>Also, the Golden Algae, Class Chrysophyceae, are a large group of yellow-brown algae found mostly in freshwater environments; they are an important food source in food web dynamics of freshwater ecosystems. They are single-celled organisms that have a cellulose cell wall just like a plant. Many are also flagellated having a tail for propulsion so they are normally found suspended in the water column. These Golden Algae are also not often found in the home aquarium.</p><p>However, there is another kind of algae that grows in aquatic environments; it brown, especially under artificial lighting in the aquarium setting. This is referred to in the aquarium trade as Brown Algae or Silica Algae.</p><h2>What Is Silica? </h2><p>In its natural state, the basic and abundant element Silicon combines with oxygen; the result is Silica, which is the basic compound in sandstone, quartz, and glass. Since this substance is readily available in the aquatic environment, myriad single-celled organisms use it to create a protective outer ""clamshell."" The organisms that do this are known as diatoms.</p><h2>Brown Silica Algaes (Diatoms) </h2><p>""Brown Algae"" is the common name that refers to the diatoms, Class Bacillariophyceae, that find their way into both freshwater and saltwater home aquariums. Diatoms are unicellular organisms that can occur either as solitary cells or in colonies.</p><p>Like plants and other algaes, diatoms photosynthesize light into energy. Each species creates a unique opal-like crystalline covering around its cell wall; these appear almost like snowflakes and are quite beautiful under a microscope even though they function as substantial armored protection for the tiny organisms.</p><p>Planktonic forms in open water usually rely on turbulent churning of the upper water to keep them suspended. But most diatoms are non-motile, as their relatively heavy cell wall causes them to readily sink to the bottom, creating a thin film across the bottom of any aquatic environment.</p><h2>Is Brown Algae Dangerous? </h2><p>In general, Brown Algae diatoms will not harm your fish if you keep them under control. Some fish do like to eat these diatoms and can help to clean up your tank, but Brown Algae is generally not good for the home aquarium environment.</p><p>Unlike blue-green algae that can come off in large slimy sheets, these diatoms don't stick together. Patches of diatoms will generally make your tank look less appealing.</p><h2>Causes of Brown Algae </h2><p>Brown Algae is a common occurrence in a newly set up aquarium. Aquariums kept in dark places are also more likely to develop Brown Algae problems because the plants and green algaes that grow in bright light compete for the nutrients diatoms need.</p><p>Brown Algae is also a sign that the water chemistry of your aquarium is not in optimal balance. After providing proper lighting, improving water quality should be your next concern. In general, you can look at a few main causes: excess silica or nitrate in the water or an abundance of nutrients.</p><p>Silica can build up in the aquarium from tap water that is high in silicic acid. It can also leach from some types of substrates that you may be using, such as silica sand. If the problem is due to high silica in the water, and Brown Algae seems to persist, get a special silicate-absorbing resin for the tank's filter.</p><p>In addition to possibly being high in your tap water, the nitrates that feed diatoms can build up from uneaten food, dead material, or overstocking fish. Increasing water changes to remove nitrates with slow the growth of these diatoms.</p><h2>Removing Brown Algae </h2><p>As the diatoms are merely resting on the bottom, a Brown Algae issue is easy to clean up; no scrubbing is necessary. This type of algae does not adhere strongly to the tank surfaces and is easily wiped away. Just wipe off any tank decorations that may be affected, wipe off all surfaces inside of the aquarium, and then vacuum the gravel.</p><p>The hardest part of removal is usually getting it out of the gravel, but vacuuming the gravel with a siphon will quickly remove it. Vacuuming is important to ensure the algae will not grow back as quickly.</p><p>In a freshwater aquarium, you can add a sucker-mouth fish that will readily eat brown algae. Stock one plecostomus or several otocinclus catfish to do this job. In a saltwater aquarium, many species of fish and invertebrates are diatom grazers.</p><h2>Preventing Brown Algae  </h2><p>Increasing the lighting so the tank gets at least eight hours of light per day. As a new tank matures, Brown Algae are often eliminated naturally by plants and green algae competing for nutrients in the water, such as nitrite and nitrate.</p><p>As with any algae, keeping the tank clean and performing regular partial water changes are the best preventative measures.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is still possible to get algae in spite of regular maintenance, especially in a newly established aquarium. Prompt attention to sudden algae growth will prevent more serious problems later on.</p>",963

The Zika virus is carried by the species of mosquito and if you have a garden pond, adding guppies may help to stop it's spread</p><h2>How the Zika Virus Is Spread </h2><p>One way the Zika virus is spread is by the bite of the mosquitoes, which can breed in a pool of water as small as a bottle cap and usually bite during the day. The aggressive yellow fever mosquito, , has spread most Zika cases.C.</p><h2>Asian Tiger Mosquito </h2><p>The much more aggressive Asian Tiger Mosquito (which is prevalent worldwide and is found in Florida's Everglades), , is also known to be a prime transmitter of the Zika virus, but it is not clear how efficiently yet. That mosquito ranges as far north as New York and Chicago in the summer. This is the mosquito most likely to bite at pool parties, outings or on the patio day or night. </p><h2>Guppies Can Prevent the Zika Virus Spread </h2><p>The spread of the Zika virus throughout the world is growing. The mosquito will be the main transmission of Zika, and the guppy can be the easiest and cheapest preventative precaution against the Zika virus if you have a pond in your backyard.</p><p>Mosquitos are now more dangerous than ever, as Zika virus spreaders. Mosquitoes reproduce by means of laying eggs on standing water, which produce aquatic larvae, maturing into adult Mosquitoes very quickly. If there is a still body of water, any water, they will breed in it!</p><p>Guppies (), in spite of their tiny size, are useful inhabitants of ponds they have been introduced into and inhabit. Specifically, one of their favorite foods is mosquito larvae and mosquito eggs. This tropical fish, the Guppy, is able to eat almost their total weight of mosquito larvae every day! </p><p>Whether you have a goldfish pond or just a water garden in your backyard this summer, you need Guppies. If you have an old pond you have forgotten full of standing water, you need Guppies!</p><p>Guppies are very prolific; they are known in the West Indies as ""million fish"" for a very good reason. If you put 5 or 6 females and a few males in a body of water at the beginning of the warm season (water temperature at least 65 F), within 6 months, under ideal conditions it is possible to have thousands of Guppies, it will seem like millions of the little mosquito eating gems. </p><h2>Mosquito Control </h2><p>The sum total of their efforts in mosquito control made much of Florida inhabitable in the 19<sup>th</sup>century, as well as many other areas of the world. The extent of their contribution is debated but they seem as desirable in nature as they are in the aquarium. Yes, the guppy is an invasive species in almost every corner of the world, but one that has worked out well in almost every instance.</p><p>Their undeniable contributions to verified mosquito control and prevention of the diseases carried by mosquitos and their bites have continued to this day.</p><h2>Mosquito Free Ponds and Standing Water Pools </h2><p>If you have goldfish in the pond, they will not hurt the guppies in any way, they won't even notice them. But remember goldfish will not eat mosquito larva or their eggs. When the weather gets warmer and the water temperature gets over 60 F, go to your local pet store and get 3 to 5 very pregnant female guppies. You know they are pregnant by a large black gravid spot on the back underside of her belly, and a very fat ""squared off"" belly.</p> <p>Do not worry about feeding Guppy's outside, they will find a way, just leave them alone and be surprised.</p><p>For added fun, get pregnant fancy guppy females, by the end of the summer, you will have a riot of color and a nice group to take into your home aquarium if you like.</p><p>There is concern about introducing nonnative species, such as the Guppy, into natural bodies of water (lakes and rivers) but this is appropriate for use in pools or ponds in back yards. Do not release Guppies or other nonnative tropical fish into the wild waters without first checking with local government wildlife officials.</p><p>The Mosquito fish (), similar to the Guppy, has been introduced by the government officials into areas for mosquito control.

57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/gravel-algae-1378630,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Pests,<h1>How to Deal With Algae on Gravel in an Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How to Deal With Algae on Gravel in an Aquarium</h1><p>No matter what you do, if you mix fish with water and light, you will get algae. Most of the time, minimal algae will not hurt your fish. It is mostly an eyesore that most humans can't stand. Heavy algae blooms can compromise your fish's oxygen consumption and water pH, though, so some maintenance will be required. There are many different types of algae than can colonize your tank, including algae that grows on gravel and other substrate.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Although most aquarium algae growth is benign, be on the watch for cyanobacteria or blue-green algae. These algae can be toxic to humans, other pets, and your aquatic pets.</p><h2>Signs of Algae on Gravel </h2><p>Algae can grow on many surfaces of your tank, including your decor, plants, and gravel substrate,. You can also have various colors of algae, including red, brown, green, or gray. Algae can grow in flat patches or raised bunches. Most commonly, flat, brown algae collects on the surface of the gravel. It may cause a slight discoloration or a dense mat.</p><h2>Causes of Algae on Gravel </h2><p>The most common cause of algae on aquarium gravel is a lack of proper maintenance. All aquariums should use a gravel vacuum to remove debris and detritus from the substrate on a regular basis. By using a gravel vacuum, you turn over the gravel substrate, depriving it of light and killing the algae. This also removes debris from the gravel that acts as nutrients for the algae.</p><p>Extended light periods can affect algae levels. If you do not have corals or other light-dependent organisms in your tank, shortening the light/dark cycle can help decrease algae levels. Or use dimmer lighting in your aquarium light fixture to slightly reduce the intensity.</p><p>Excess algae in aquariums can also be secondary to high nitrate or phosphate levels. Nitrate, the end of your nitrogen cycle, is used by plants and algae as a food source. If you have been lax in your maintenance protocols, your nitrate level will increase and provide more food for algae to flourish. Phosphate is more commonly associated with high source-water levels. These may be difficult to remove and may require finding a new source water. Over feeding also introduces high amounts of phosphate into the water.</p><h2>How to Fix Algae on Gravel </h2><p>The best method to fixing algae on aquarium gravel is to cut off its food sources: light, nitrate, and phosphate. This is mainly done by performing regular maintenance using a gravel siphon. Vacuuming will turn over your substrate, cutting off its access to light, and remove nitrate and phosphate from your water.</p><p>All fish species have a different tolerance to high nitrate levels. Some fish can tolerate very high levels, whereas others cannot tolerate much at all. Do your research prior to bringing your fish home so you know what water chemistry parameters you must maintain. Test your water chemistry regularly to make sure that all your levels, including your nitrate, are within range.</p><p>Phosphate can be more difficult to remove. In freshwater aquariums, they are often high in your source water. In saltwater aquariums, they may be added to various salt mixtures since some coral species require phosphate. If you do not have any corals in your tank, you do not need to use a coral-specific mix. Phosphate-binding filter media can be added, but consistent problems with source water levels may require using a different source, such as bottled (not distilled) water.</p><h2>Algae Prevention </h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no guaranteed method to avoid algae altogether. The best method to prevent heavy algae build up is to keep up with your regular tank maintenance. Your maintenance routine will vary based on the species, the number of animals and their diet. Use a gravel siphon to turn over your substrate, blocking light access and removing excess food and waste. Test your water chemistry regularly to make sure your nitrate and phosphate levels are not making the algae issue worse.</p><p>UV lights only kill algae cells in suspension and have no effect on algae already established in your aquarium. A UV light may help keep the problem from getting worse, but it will not kill any algae attached to your substrate. UV lights do not treat any parasites or bacteria affecting your fish.</p><p>Remember, in low amounts, algae is more of a nuisance to humans; your fish couldn't care less. A tank overrun with algae, however, can have serious health consequences for your fish, affecting oxygen and pH levels between the daylight and nighttime hours. Keeping up with your maintenance routine is the best thing you can do to keep your fish healthy and your algae levels in check.</p>",765
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/combat-aquarium-pest-hydra-1381228,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquarium Pests,<h1>How to Combat the Aquarium Pest Hydra</h1>,"<h1>How to Combat the Aquarium Pest Hydra</h1><p>A Hydra is a soft-bodied polyp of the Phylum Cnidaria, one of the most ancient animal groups in evolutionary terms which includes corals, jellyfish, hydras, and myxozoans. A Hydra has a tubular body with a sticky foot at one end and a dozen tentacles at the other. Like jellyfish, these tentacles possess stinging cells that allow the Hydra to immobilize their prey. They primarily eat small aquatic organisms such as cyclops, daphnia, and other aquatic crustaceans, but can catch and ingest small fish.</p><p>Hydras are sometimes accidentally introduced into freshwater aquariums when adding plants. A Hydra has no brain, no circulatory or respiratory system, nor even any musculature, yet it poses a real danger to small freshwater aquarium fish.</p><h2>Killer Hydra </h2><p>Although a small pest, measuring just an inch or less, Hydras are capable of killing and eating most fish fry and even small adult fish. Furthermore, they asexually reproduce rapidly by producing buds that grow into new Hydra, break off, and go out on their own. Although they generally stay in one spot, a Hydra is quite capable of uprooting and moving around; all they have to do is release their foot and float to a new spot. Hydra can also slowly inch along a substrate by attaching and releasing their tentacles and foot alternatively.</p><p>Given their reproductive capabilities, their capacity to relocate, and their ability to eat prey several times their size, it's clear why Hydras are not welcome in a freshwater aquarium. Prevention is key.</p><h2>Anti-Hydra Treatments </h2><p>Once Hydras are introduced to an aquarium, they are difficult but not impossible to eradicate. If you are fortunate to have a very small infestation, you may be able to physically remove the Hydras with deep cleaning. Artificial plants and rocks with attached Hydras can be removed from the tank and soaked in a 10 percent bleach solution for 10 to 15 minutes, then scrub and rinse with plain water and allow them to air dry.</p><p>A less disruptive way to eliminate Hydras is to add in fish that eat them. Three Spot (Blue) Gouramis are particularly voracious consumers of Hydra. Paradise fish and Mollies are also very fond of eating Hydra. Even pond snails will gobble them up.</p><p>If adding fish or snails isn't an option for you, heat can also be used. However, you will have to remove your fish. Once the fish have been temporarily relocated, increase the temperature of the water up to at least 104 degrees Fahrenheit (40 Celcius) for about two hours. Turn the heat back down, vacuum the gravel to remove any Hydras that have fallen to the bottom of the tank, and perform a large water change (approximately 50 percent) to remove the hot water. Make sure the temperature has dropped to the previous level before reintroducing the fish.</p><p>Chemical or medicinal bath treatments are available that will eradicate Hydra, but keep in mind that they are often harmful to live plants, snails, and even the fish themselves. Some medications can also harm your beneficial bacteria in the biofilter, so these treatments should only be considered as a last resort.</p><p>Among the chemical options are copper sulfate and potassium permanganate, which can be purchased at your local fish store. Follow dosing instructions on the product label. Many of the anti-fluke medications are also effective against Hydra, particularly those containing Formalin, such as ParaGuard.</p><h2>Preventing Hydras </h2><p>Hydras do not spontaneously grow; a Hydra is a stowaway that is always introduced from an external source. Once in place though, having plenty of food sources will encourage their speedy growth. Therefore maintaining a clean tank and avoiding overfeeding will prevent any Hydras that do come in from rapidly multiplying, giving you time to address the problem.</p><p>Carefully inspect any new live plants before adding them to the aquarium to help avoid accidentally bringing in a Hydra. An even more proactive approach is to soak live plants for five to 10 minutes in a quart of water with a tablespoon of dissolved alum, a common pharmacy ingredient used in pickling and canning vegetables. This can be done for new rocks as well. Following the soak, rinse the objects well with plain water.</p><p>Live foods are great for conditioning fish for breeding, and to provide good nutritional balance. However, if your live foods are collected directly from freshwater ponds or streams, there is a considerable risk of collecting a Hydra at the same time. Using frozen foods or growing your own live foods omits that risk.</p>",744

Studies find that the majority of freshwater community aquarium fish prefer live aquarium plants to their plastic counterparts. This is no doubt because live aquarium plants are a key part of creating a natural or close-to-natural environment for most freshwater aquarium fish. Unlike plastic plants, live plants will remove carbon dioxide from the water, utilize nitrates, and add oxygen.</p><p>In a well-planted aquarium, fish can find shade from glaring light, privacy from things outside of the tank that startle them, and a natural safety in times of stress. Live plants allow smaller, shyer fish to evade larger or aggressive tank mates or overeager potential breeding partners. For shoaling fish, plants give the group the currents and eddies they instinctively seek out in the wild.</p><p>When breeding many species, live aquarium plants are essential surfaces for the deposit and fertilization of eggs. Live aquarium plants have natural infusoria and other essential algae clinging to them or growing from them that feed the newborn fry of many species.</p><h2>Care and Needs of Freshwater Aquarium Plants </h2><p>Live aquarium plants need three basic things to stay healthy and provide important benefits in the aquarium environment.</p><h2>Ground Cover Plants </h2><p>Vallisneria and other ground cover plants send out ""runners"" which develop into new rooted separate plants. These new plants can be broken off as they mature and moved to another location in the tank or another aquarium entirely as a new fully-viable plant.</p><p>These true aquatic plants are great for ground cover and should be placed in the rear of the aquarium since most species grow tall. It must be noted that these ""true aquatic"" plants cannot tolerate a dry condition, so do not remove them from the aquarium and allow them to dry out as this will severely damage or kill them. Even moving from aquarium to aquarium or from store to home aquarium should be done in a container of water. Air damage can occur quickly and makes plants unattractive for weeks.</p><h2>Node Propagators </h2><p>Myriophyllum, Ludwigia, and Acorus, as well as many other plants commonly found in aquarium stores, are node propagators. Their long stringy branches easily break off and float on the surface of the aquarium. These loose branches can be gathered in a small bunch, anchored with a weight strip, and planted firmly in the substrate; the new ""clump"" of branches will soon root and become a new complete plant.</p><p>When a branch breaks off several new branches will grow out from the leaf nodes, making the plant thicker each time it is broken or clipped. If you choose to clip the plant, cut the branch close to a set of leaves, as roots grow from the node where the leaf connects to the branch. </p><h2>Aquatic Plants from Bulbs </h2><p>Bulbs can be dried from some aquarium plants and planted. Dry and seemingly dead, under the substrate, once planted underwater, these ""bulbs"" will quickly sprout and grow very fast under the right conditions. The Madagascar Lace is a prime example of this type of aquatic plant. These plants, also available in aquarium stores from time to time, are easy to grow and can be very attractive.</p><p>One drawback is that they have a definite growing season. They will grow and put out leaf after leaf from the base at a central core until finally, they produce a flower of sorts in the center of the core. Once a ""flower"" has been produced, the plant will go into decline and seem to die. The plant has not died, it is dormant; in nature, it would stay dormant through the dry season, storing its energy until the next rainy season.</p><p>When you see this type of plant go into decline remove the ""bulb"" from the aquarium (sometimes there will now be two or three bulbs when you dig it up from the substrate). Dry it and keep it in a cool dark place for at least three months. If there are multiple distinct bulbs, separate them. Plant the ""bulbs"" the same way you did it originally and observe the cycle again.</p><h2>Aquatic Plants That Propagate by Seed </h2><p>Some aquatic plants propagate by seed, but most of these are not true aquatics. Some underwater plants, like the Amazon Sword Plant in its many varieties, can grow out of the water or under the water. As with the ""bulb"" type plants, this is nature's way of ensuring that a plant will live through a cycle of wet and dry seasons. These plants cannot be propagated by drying and replanting seeds that eventually appear after a flowering stage; most of these aquatic plants reproduce by sending out runners.</p><h2>Plants That Grow Both in and Out of Water </h2><p>Some plants, like the Water Wisteria and Amazon Sword Plant, can grow both in and out of the water. When purchased in the store, most of these plants will have solid leaves and a firm thick appearance. When planted underwater, an amazing change takes place: the leaves grow much wider and are laced with beautiful flowing clumps.</p><p>In Europe, aquarists let these particular plants grow out of the top of the water, and again adjust to open air. They will grow up towards lights hanging one or two feet above the aquarium and revert to their ""dry air"" form. This presents an interesting look with the ""underwater form"" of the plant within the aquarium and the ""dry season"" version of the plant thriving above the tank itself. Though this is not a popular type of aquarium style in the United States and Canada, it is worth a look. </p><p>Live aquatic plants belong in home aquariums and the conditions that make aquarium plants grow and thrive make aquarium fish happy and healthy as well. Good basics are all that you need: proper lighting, substrate, controlled temperature, and healthy water conditions. To some hobbyists, live aquatic plants are as interesting as the fish in the aquarium. And to a select few hobbyists, those who create whole aquacultures and ecosystems for their planted aquariums, the fish are merely the decoration.</p><p>Aquarium Care and Maintenance: Aquatic Plants. </p>",1014
60,https://www.thesprucepets.com/vacuum-the-aquarium-gravel-1379943,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquariums & Habitat,<h1>Should You Vacuum Your Aquarium Gravel?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Vacuum Your Aquarium Gravel?</h1><p>Your aquarium's maintenance needs can vary based on your setup, equipment, and time. Along with installing the proper filtration systems to maintain water quality, it's also important to clean the gravel at the bottom of your tank to keep conditions healthy for your fish. The simplest way to carry out this procedure is by using a gravel cleaner, or gravel siphon.</p><h3>What Is a Gravel Cleaner for Fish Tanks?</h3><p>An aquarium gravel siphon is a manually operated vacuum that pulls gravel up from the bottom of the tank, then churns it in water to remove dirt, algae, and fish waste.</p><p>There is some debate as to whether this procedure is necessary and if it could possibly be making your water quality worse. No matter your setup, vacuuming makes your tank a healthier environment for your fish.</p><h2>What Is ""Vacuuming?"" </h2><p>If this is a foreign concept for you, don't worry; you are not alone. Vacuuming an aquarium is performed using a gravel siphon. This siphon is made up of a large, rigid tube connected to narrower, flexible aquarium tubing. There are some that will hook up to a sink to assist with siphoning; otherwise, you will need the assistance of gravity.</p><p>Some vacuums come with an air-filled bladder to start the pull of gravity. Others you will need to start the siphon manually. It is not recommended to suck on the open end of the siphon! Although rare, there are a few zoonotic diseases you can catch from your fish, not to mention getting water in your lungs.</p><p>Once your siphon is started, vacuuming is a simple process. If your substrate is too deep (more than two inches), vacuuming may not be sufficient to clean the deep layers. Stick the rigid tube into the substrate and allow a few seconds for the sand/gravel/rocks to be pulled into the tube. Before they get more than halfway to three quarters into the siphon, pick up the tube and allow the substrate to fall back down. You will see the lighter particulates, mostly fish/plant waste and excess food, floating up the siphon and into the flexible tubing. Repeat throughout your substrate.</p><h2>What Does ""Vacuuming"" Do? </h2><p>Vacuuming removes the small particulates from the substrate. Mostly, this is made up of fish waste, dead plant material, and excess food, especially if you feed a flake diet. These lighter particulates get sucked away while your substrate stays in place.</p><p>If those particulates were left in place, it will cause problems with your water quality. Leftover food, fish, and plant waste break down and release ammonia into your water. Ammonia is toxic to fish and why you work so hard to cultivate good bacteria in your biological filters. By removing these particulates before they break down, you will decrease the ammonia concentration in your aquarium.</p><p>Deep pockets of debris, once cut off from oxygen in the water, can develop anaerobic bacteria populations. These bacteria use sulfur as a food source, and when disturbed, release hydrogen sulfide into the water. This is another toxic substance that can kill fish and cause increased disease. You will know if you have accidentally disturbed these bacteria since your tank will smell like rotting eggs. If this happens, evacuate your fish to clean, treated water as soon as possible, and thoroughly rinse your aquarium before putting your fish back.</p><h2>But If I Vacuum, I'll Remove The Good Bacteria </h2><p>The particulates you vacuum up are small but not microscopic. Your good bacteria live in your substrate deep within the crevices. Vacuuming will remove only a tiny percentage. If you are relying on your substrate to do the bulk of your biological filtration for your nitrogen cycle, your system is not sustainable.</p><p>All tanks must have biological filter media to colonize good bacteria. Be they sponges, matting, fluidized beds, socks, bioballs, or rocks, there are many ways to house good bacteria in fish tanks. Vacuuming your substrate as part of your regular maintenance will not significantly diminish your bacterial colonies.</p><h2>What About Planted Tanks? </h2><p>These systems may be less well tolerant of vacuuming. Plant roots can become dense and make vacuuming almost impossible. For these systems, it is critical that the roots get oxygen. It is recommended you use a substrate specific for plants.</p><h2>What if I Don't Have a Vacuum? </h2><p>If you do not have a vacuum, you must have another way of removing fish waste and plant material from your tank. Undergravel filters are a tricky business and should not be used as a complete maintenance replacement. In fish tanks with only a few fish, some owners remove waste with a simple turkey baster. Scavenger species, such as shrimp and snails, can break down the waste organically, but only in tanks with low fish density.</p><p>You must also be very careful when feeding to make sure there is no excess food wasted. This is easier when using a pelleted food over a flake food. Pelleted foods pack more nutrition overall and come in very small sizes.</p><h2>How Often Should I Vacuum My Tank? </h2><p>As with all the best maintenance routines, regular vacuuming, either once a week or once every other week, is best for your aquarium. Be sure to remove all your decor prior to vacuuming. You'll be amazed how much waste settles under those pretty plants and castles.</p><p>Vacuuming provides a quick and easy way to perform your regular water changes. Use the waste water for your plants or gardens!</p><p>Overall, vacuuming is an easy way to keep your aquarium healthy and will not decrease your biological filtration.</p>",921
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/seeding-new-aquarium-1381286,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Aquariums & Habitat,<h1>How and Why You Should Seed a New Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How and Why You Should Seed a New Aquarium</h1><p>Seeding a new aquarium has become a popular practice. It is the process of transferring nitrifying bacteria from an established aquarium to a new aquarium. Seeding gives the new aquarium a jump start on the cycling process. Normally, it takes 4 to 6 weeks for the growth of beneficial bacteria to complete the nitrogen cycle in a new aquarium. It is not unusual for seeded aquariums to fully cycle in half the time it would normally take, thus allowing you to stock more fish in the new tank sooner. Seeding also helps to reduce stress on the fish and reduces or eliminates fish loss due to the startup cycle.</p><h2>Where the Bacteria Live </h2><p>Contrary to some reports, significant amounts of nitrifying bacteria are not present in the water itself; they are attached to surfaces in the aquarium. Therefore, transferring water from an established tank won't do much good. Most nitrifying bacteria reside in the gravel and in filter media (ceramic rings, filter floss, sponge, etc.). The bacteria also can be present in rocks, artificial plants, and other elements with porous surfaces.</p><h2>Aquarium Seeding Material Sources </h2><p>The challenge of acquiring seeding material is why more people don't seed their new aquariums, but there are several options for getting your hands on some. If you have at least one aquarium running already, seeding material is easily obtained.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>When procuring seeding material from an established aquarium, be sure that there are no diseased fish in the tank. You don't want to bring bad bacteria or parasites into your new aquarium!<br/></p><h2>Transporting Seeding Material </h2><p>Moving seeding material from one tank to another must be done quickly to ensure the bacteria stay alive. Before transferring seeding material, set up the new aquarium and allow it to run for a day to stabilize the temperature and water chemistry. Once that is done, get your seeding material and use it within the hour.</p><p>During transport, keep the material covered with a small amount of water from the original tank (the source of the seeding material). Do not subject it to significant temperature changes, and move it as quickly as possible. Allowing seeding material to sit for more than an hour can result in the death of the nitrifying bacteria, as they require oxygen in the water to survive. If the material is subject to extreme hot or cold, discard it and get fresh seeding material.</p><h2>Seeding With Substrate </h2><p>There are two options for seeding a new aquarium using substrate from an established aquarium. The first is to simply distribute the seeding substrate in an even layer on the top of the substrate in the newly set up aquarium. This option works well if the substrates are similar in color and size.</p><p>The other method uses a bag made of nylon pantyhose. You fill the toe of the hose with 1/2 to 1 cup of the substrate, then tie off the bag, cut it from the rest of the leg, and hang the whole thing in the tank. Once the tank has cycled, remove the bag and discard it (or you can use it to line the bottom of a potted plant; the substrate allows excess water to drain from the soil, and the debris from the aquarium makes good fertilizer).</p><h2>Seeding With Filter Media </h2><p>Filter media is an excellent seeding material. The easiest way to use this method is to place an extra filter on an established tank for a few weeks to allow nitrifying bacteria to grow on the filter media. Sponge filters are ideal for this, as they are small, inexpensive, and easy to move. Power or even canister filters can also be used.</p><p>Once the new aquarium has been set up and has run for at least a day to stabilize the temperature, the seeding filter can be moved from the established tank to the new tank. Leave the seeding filter in place until the new aquarium has fully cycled. If desired, you can leave it in place indefinitely to serve as a source of seeding material in the future. It can also be used to quickly set up a hospital tank if the need arises.</p><p>An alternate method is to use fresh filter media (ceramic rings or a sponge) designed for use in the new aquarium filter. Place the media in a mesh bag and hang it in the established tank for a couple of weeks prior to setting up the new aquarium. This will allow nitrifying bacteria to grow within the media. When the new aquarium has been filled and the filter is ready to be installed, remove the bag from the established tank and immediately place the wet media in the new filter. This will start the new biofilter with beneficial bacteria grown in the media while it was in the established aquarium.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Also, there are many beneficial bacteria supplements and ""bacteria starters"" available through pet shops that will help a new aquarium go through the nitrogen cycle faster. Adding these boosters along with the seeding material will shorten the time it takes a new aquarium to develop a mature biological filter. This will reduce the risk of getting ""New Tank Syndrome,"" where the fish produce toxic wastes faster than the beneficial bacteria can break them down and make the aquarium water safe for the fish.</p>",880
62,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-protein-skimming-2925328,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Live Rock Filtration & Systems,<h1>How Do Protein Skimmers Clean Saltwater Aquariums?</h1>,"<h1>How Do Protein Skimmers Clean Saltwater Aquariums?</h1><p>Protein skimmers are often a good choice for keeping your saltwater aquarium clean. Besides primary biological filtration, foam fractionating (better known as protein skimming) is the most important aspect of any healthy marine system.</p><p>Although there are systems that claim to be ""skimmer-free,"" for most of us, dissolved organic compounds (DOC), phenol oils, and other yellowing agents are a nuisance. Only active protein skimming can eliminate the need for these.</p><p>In general, all skimmers work in the same way, but there are different designs that have developed over the years. These include co-current, counter-current, venturi-style, and ETS skimmers. Each works in a slightly different manner.</p><p>It's also important to understand that different manufacturers put their own twist on the basic design. While your choices in a skimmer are vast, it remains important to understand their basic function.</p><h2>How Do Skimmers Clean Water? </h2><p>To put it simply, the air bubbles inside the skimmer's body strip the water of undesirable waste by-products. How the bubbles accomplish this is a neat trick that requires explanation.</p><p>Did you ever blow bubbles as a kid? Remember all the rainbow colors on them? Those pretty rainbow colors were the light refracting off the soap film. Just as the soap clung to the giant bubbles, so too does all the junk and other organic gunk in your aquarium water. </p><p>In skimmers, the bubbles are microscopic and the results can only be seen after they burst and deposit their ""films"" into the collection cup. No pretty rainbow of color here, only the vilest and nastiest looking sludge imaginable ride our skimmer's bubbles.</p><p>How this happens was discovered long ago in waste treatment plants. By injecting high volumes of air bubbles into a column of wastewater, the resulting outgoing water (effluent) was purer and much cleaner than before. This amazing process is all due to surface tension. </p><h2>Surface Tension and Skimming </h2><p>Surface tension is caused by the friction created when the oxygen bubble and the surrounding water interact. This friction, in turn, charges the molecules in the water.</p><p>Playing on the old law of physics that ""opposites attract,"" the charged gunk molecules stick to the bubbles, riding them up the column of water. Once the bubbles reach the surface air, they burst and deposit their hitchhikers into a collection cup. This cup keeps the accumulated gunk from slipping back down into the water column inside the reaction chamber.</p><p>Due to the very nature of saltwater, this process is possible. Freshwater protein skimming just isn't feasible at a consumer level as the technology to make it happen simply isn't practical for the hobbyist.</p><h2>Co-Current Protein Skimming </h2><p>Bubble size is a fundamental ingredient to a successful protein skimmer and various methods are used to create the ""perfect"" bubble.</p><p>European hobbyists were among the first to recognize the importance of skimming their aquariums. More specifically, Germans have been responsible for designing some of the finest models. Tunze and others brought protein skimming to U.S. shores with the original design, which was called co-current skimming.</p><h3>Fun Fact</h3><p>Originally, limewood was used to create the froth required in skimming and it is still employed today.</p><p>The basic co-current skimmers used an open-ended tube or cylinder with the bubble source mounted at the base. As with uplift tubes used in under-gravel filter plates, co-current skimmers use the volume of air bubbles rising in the column to bring them into contact with the system water within the chamber body. The water is ""drawn"" up into the cylinder from below the water's surface and once the bubbles burst at the collection cup, the treated or stripped waters simply ""falls"" back down into the aquarium.</p><p>Co-current skimmer designs can either be hang-on or sump-mounted.</p><h2>Counter-Current Skimming </h2><p>The co-current method works but it isn't terribly efficient. The problem is what we call ""dwell time,"" or the length of time the water is in contact with the bubbles. By lengthening the reaction chamber, more water could be processed and more gunk removed. The trouble was that not many people wanted a 6-foot tube sticking up behind their aquariums.</p><p>Research and development created the next step in skimmer evolution: counter-current skimming. You can liken this advancement to astronomy and the difference between a Newtonian telescope and a refracting telescope. Just as bending light waves by reflecting them off a mirror can double the focal length of a telescope, so too can we double the dwell time in a skimmer.</p><p>In a counter-current skimmer, the water is injected at the top of the reaction tube. The bubble source and the isolated outlet fitting are located at the bottom of the chamber. The water, therefore, has to pass against, or ""counter,"" to the rising wall of bubbles. This effectively doubles the dwell time making for a more productive unit.</p><p>Many companies today market variations on this counter-current design.</p><h2>Venturi-Style Skimming </h2><p>In the pursuit of building a ""better mousetrap,"" The Mazzei Injector Company developed what came to be known as the Mazzei valve. Today, all skimmers that use this method of air-injection are called venturi-style skimmers. </p><p>These models do not use an airstone or limewood diffuser to create the bubble column. Instead, they rely on a venturi valve to deliver both the water to be treated and the billions of microscopic bubbles. This is accomplished within the wasp-waist design.</p><h2>How Does the Venturi Valve Work? </h2><p>Venturi valves are easily recognizable and follow the same basic design. The high-velocity water entering from the left is bottle-necked at the molded wasp waist. The intake nipple is arranged at the top of the tube where the water movement creates air-draw, which is how bubbles are formed inside the valve. The froth exiting the valve is introduced into the main skimmer body where it removes organics.</p><p>By offsetting the fitting at the bottom of the cylinder, a vortex is created and the dwell time is magnified significantly.</p><p>For years, this was the professional's choice for serious foam fractionating, and in many circles, it remains as such. These skimmers require an outlet pipe as the volume of water that they can process in an hour necessitates a ""flow-through"" design. Usually, the effluent is high on the skimmer's main body, being directed back into a sump or display tank.</p><h2>Modifying Powerheads </h2><p>You can modify a common powerhead to provide virtually the same results as the venturi valve. These modifications make small volume powerheads available for smaller skimmers in micro reef systems.</p><p>You will also find that many hang-on style skimmers use the modified powerhead as the main pump. They mimic the venturi valve concept by allowing air to be drawn into the impeller housing. The impeller chops the water-air mixture and shoots it into the skimmer. It's actually quite simple and elegant.</p><h2>ETS's and Down-Draft Skimming </h2><p>Another and even simpler design became popular in the mid-2000s when the ETS (Environmental Tower Skimmer) was introduced to the hobbyist. Also known as down-draft skimmers, these designs can process huge volumes of water and are favored by big tank owners.</p><p>ETS models use a long tube connected to a sump with nothing more than an internal baffle plate and a drain valve. Bio-balls are placed inside the tube to diffuse the high-velocity water that is injected through the top. As the water shoots down over the bio-balls, it is smashed multiple times on the tower of bio-balls.</p><p>By the time the water reaches the sump at its base, the water is a white sea of foam. The baffle inside the sump creates dwell time. It also allows the protein-rich froth to rise up into a wide-mouthed tube with the collection cup mounted above it. </p><p>Smaller designs that follow the same principles allow smaller capacity systems to benefit as well. As with most basic protein skimmer models, individual companies offer variations on the original design.</p>",1264
63,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-sump-and-overflow-box-setups-2925894,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Live Rock Filtration & Systems,<h1>What to Know About Aquarium Sump and Overflow Box Setups</h1>,"<h1>What to Know About Aquarium Sump and Overflow Box Setups</h1><p>As an aquarium owner, you have to make a lot of choices to keep your tank and fish safe.</p><p>The sump reservoir is ideal for aquarium owners who want to keep their filtration equipment out of the main aquarium's space. Sumps are a staple of most marine and reef tanks, but they can be used on freshwater tanks, too. This extra reservoir can increase the aesthetics of your tank and allow for maintenance to occur without disturbing the tank's occupants.</p><h3>What Is a Sump Filter?</h3><p>A ""sump"" refers to an external water reservoir below the aquarium that water flows into before being pumped back up into the main tank. The sump usually holds additional filtration components.</p><p>Sumps are typically made of glass or acrylic, but some aquarium owners also get creative by using storage tubs or old, unused tanks to make sump reservoirs. Most sumps will sit under your tank, so before you get started, make sure you have reasonable space and access.</p><p>Ease of maintenance to socks and other biomedia</p><p>Increase your water volume to improve water quality</p><p>Ability to add other filter components more easily</p><p>Increased tank aesthetic</p><p>Can overflow and drain tank if not set up properly</p><p>Decreased available storage space for tank accessories (nets, décor, treatments, etc)</p><p>Slight increase in noise</p><h2>Other Types of Filtration </h2><p>If sumps seem too ambitious, there are two other filter methods you should research.</p><h3>Hang-On Filters</h3><p>This type of filter is simple and straightforward. Simply hang the filter on the back of your tank, prime it by adding water to the reservoir, and plug it in. What's recommended is using sturdy sponges as compared to flimsy floss. These are critical to the building of your biofilter and should never be replaced.</p><h3>Canister Filters </h3><p>These filters are external, like a sump, but are protected from overflows and accidental drainings by being pressurized. Similar to a sump, you will set up the intake and return tubes from your main tank to the filter that usually sits under your tank. Inside the canister is a variety of mechanical (link) and biological (link) filters. As with the hang-on filters, it is critical to your biological filtration that you never replace these components.</p><p>Both of these options are easy alternatives to a sump. However, for the reasons listed above, sumps can be a great addition to your tank if you're looking for increased filtration capabilities.</p><h2>What Do You Need to Set Up a Sump? </h2><p>Most commonly, a sump setup will be sold as a kit with biomedia. You can use this or a simple plain aquarium and add your own media. Sumps are filled using gravity with a pump to return water to the tank. You will need appropriate hoses to move the water back and forth from your tank. Employ a skimmer box to cycle water in between your tank and sump. This will decrease the pull of the outflow to prevent animals from being sucked into the sump. It also acts as a fail-safe to protect your sump from accidentally draining your tank.</p><h2>How to Correctly Set Up a Sump </h2><p>Place your overflow skimmer that will supply your sump in an area that is away from decor, feeding zones, or any fish hiding places. Ideally, you should set up your outflow and inflow in opposing spots so it creates a gyre, or system of currents, in your tank.</p><p>Connect tubing between overflow skimmer to sump inflow. If you are making your own sump without a kit, inflow from the tank should come into one side of the tank and return on the opposite side. Ideally, your inflow should cover the top of the tank and the outflow collects water from the bottom after it flows over the biological filter media you have chosen.</p><p>Set up your return hoses from the sump pump to return water from the sump to the tank. If you lose power, your sump will have to hold the extra water in the lines and any additional water that is pulled via gravity.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Keep the return hose close to the top of your water line in your main tank. If you lose power or your pump fails, this way it will drain your tank. This is also why you should place air pumps above your tank.</p><p>Choose a sump size and fill line to accommodate any accidents.</p><p>Position the return so it flows through the tank before reaching the outflow. If your outflow is too close to the return to your sump, you are not filtering the entire volume of your tank.</p><p>Sumps usually pull water from your tank via gravity and return it by using a ""sump"" pump. This is not the same type of sump pump that keeps your basement dry. Most kits will have a pump appropriately sized to match the flow of gravity from the skimmer basket and tubing size selected. If you are making your own, it is critical to match the flow of gravity to the pump return.</p><p>To gage the outflow, start your skimmer basket by priming it with water from the main tank. Catch the outflowing water in a measured container. Once the flow has established, time 10 seconds and watch to see how much water flows out. The gallons per second will tell you exactly what type of pump to buy. If you are unable to perform this test, buy a pump with a variable speed switch to manipulate the flow to match the outflow.</p><p>With the correct size pump, start the gravity outflow and plug your pump in. Watch your sump line carefully to make sure it isn't creeping up or sinking too low. You may have to manipulate your pump setting to match the flow of gravity.</p><p>Check your sump level a few times over the next 48 hours and make adjustments as necessary.</p><p>As with all other biomedia, it will take approximately four to six weeks for the media to be fully ""cycled.""</p><p>When done correctly, sumps can be a great tool for your aquarium.

There are so many different types of filters (Wet/Dry, Berlin Method, Jaulbert Method, Canister, UGF, Fluid, Protein Skimmer, etc.) to choose from, it can be mind boggling. Fortunately, there is a fairly simple method for selecting the right filter system for your tank.</p><h2>Filter Basics </h2><p>Before you can decide what filter types you want to use, you need to understand what function each filter performs. With the exception of the Biological Filter, no other single filter is an absolute requirement. Let's take a quick look at the different filters.</p><p>Now that you understand the basics of each filter type, let's start putting your filtration system together. The following process will eliminate options which will not work for your situation, one by one until your options are reduced to only a few types. Click on the link below to get started.</p><h2>Sump or No Sump? </h2><p>Learn what a sump is, the pros and cons of using a sump and the various styles of sumps. There is also information for those of you Do-It-Yourselfers who like to make their own equipment whenever possible.</p><p>Offers a platform for the widest range of equipment</p><p>Increases system water volume</p><p>Can double as a refugium for algae, live rock, or mangroves</p><p>Can keep all equipment out of sight</p><p>May be difficult to plumb</p><p>Can be noisy</p><p>Increased chance of external water leaks</p><p>Now we come to the first fork in the road in choosing a filter. You'll either choose a filter with a sump or one without a sump.</p><h2>In-Sump Equipment </h2><p>Saltwater aquariums which include a sump can house the widest variety of equipment. Models for everything from pumps, to wet/dry filters, to protein skimmers, to heaters, to algae, live rock and denitrators which have been designed specifically for sumps can be found.</p><p>If you have a basic idea of which types of filters you will using in your sump, you can get a feel for how much each filter will cost and what models will work for you by reading reviews reading reviews and compare prices on in-sump protein skimmers, a build-your-own wet/dry filter, submersible heaters, and submersible pumps (powerheads). Many aquarists also include live rock, some of the beneficial macroalgaes or even mangrove plants in their sumps.</p><p>Setting up the protein skimmer in your sump isn't difficult it just takes a little planning.</p><h2>External Location? </h2><p>Some equipment (pumps, skimmers, canister filters, UV filters) can be placed outside of the tank, connected to the tank with various hoses, pipes or overflows.</p><p>More equipment options</p><p>No need to use Hang On or In Tank equipment</p><p>Cleaner looking tank</p><p>Can make the area near the tank cluttered</p><p>Increases possibility of external water leaks</p><p>The next fork in the road: Is externally located equipment a possibility or desirable for your situation?</p><h2>Remote Mounted Equipment </h2><p>If you don't want to have a sump and you want to keep your tank (inside and out) as uncluttered as possible, remote mounted equipment may be the ticket for you. There are a number of pieces of equipment which can be mounted a distance away from your tank. Many of the items below were specifically designed for or can be adapted to remote mounting.</p><p>Many In-Sump Protein Skimmers can be easily adapted.<br/>Most Canister Filters are designed to adapt easily for remote mounting.<br/>Many of the Combination Wet/Dry systems can be adapted, also.</p><p>Be careful when you are selecting and setting up the components. Some of them require that they be kept at the same level as the tank.</p><h2>Hang-On or In-Tank? </h2><p>There is a wide variety of equipment which can be hung outside the back and sides of an aquarium. Protein skimmers, water pumps, wet/dry filters and overflow supplied equipment can be found in a variety of styles, made by a number of manufacturers.</p><p>The types of equipment which can be mounted or used inside the tank is somewhat limited. However, there are a number of filtration systems which are designed to use only In-Tank equipment and materials. Many SW aquarium purists utilize very few devices and have some of the most fantastic aquariums you will ever see.</p><p>Here's the next fork in the road: Hang-On-Tank equipment vs In-Tank equipment.</p><h2>Hang-On-Tank Equipment </h2><p>Many aquarists prefer the convenience of Hang-On-Tank equipment. If you have the room (usually less than 8"") on either the back or sides of your aquarium, you will find this a great place to hang all of your new tank toys. Almost every type of saltwater aquarium equipment can be found in a Hang-On-Tank style. The following links will give you an idea of what Hang-On-Tank equipment is available on the market and how much the prices vary.</p><p>You can easily mix and match different pieces to complete your filtration system design.</p><h2>In-Tank Equipment </h2><p>Relying solely on In-Tank equipment limits your options for filtration equipment somewhat. That being said, some of the most outstanding FO, FOWLR and Reef systems use only what can be placed in the tank for filtration.</p><p>Under Gravel Filters are the old standby and work quite well. They do require a bit more maintenance than some of the other Biological Filters, but they are inexpensive (you can easily custom build your own UGF) and easy to install. The Undergravel Filter Controversy will probably rage on for years, but you can read the arguments and make your own decision as to whether or not it will work for you.</p><p>The Live Rock / Berlin Systems and the Live Sand Filtration & Jaubert or Plenum System setups have been around for quite a while and are among the favorites used by reef system purists.</p><p>There are a number of In-Tank-Skimmers which take up little room in your tank and work quite well.</p><p>For water circulation in your tank, the wide variety of Submersible Pumps on the market today gives you plenty of choices to pick from.</p><p>Add a submersible heater (optional) and an air pump (if needed) and you are ready to go.</p>",973
65,https://www.thesprucepets.com/using-activated-carbon-in-aquarium-systems-2924393,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Live Rock Filtration & Systems,<h1>Using Activated Carbon in Saltwater Aquarium Systems</h1>,"<h1>Using Activated Carbon in Saltwater Aquarium Systems</h1><p>Activated carbon has been used for many years in both saltwater and freshwater aquariums for a number of purposes.</p><h2>What Is Activated Carbon? </h2><p>Activated Carbon is also called activated charcoal, activated coal or . Activated carbon is a form of carbon that has been processed to make it extremely porous and thus to have a very large surface area available for adsorption or chemical reactions. Activated carbon is manufactured from carbon, typically coal. The two most common forms are bituminous and lignite based. Another form that is not made from coal is coconut shell based.</p><p>Activated carbon is processed into three forms: Granular, pellets and powder. The granular and pellets are most commonly used in aquarium filters.</p><h2>What Does It Do? </h2><p>The use of activated carbon in marine tanks is considered to be a form of chemical filtration. Working through absorption, activated carbon removes gelbstoff (the compounds that give water in an aquarium the yellow tint), some large organic molecules, medications, chlorine, pollutants and toxins, as well as many other types of chemical elements and compounds from the water that a protein skimmer or another means of filtration may not remove.</p><p>Activated carbon can also remove the trace elements and minerals that are important to your fish, invertebrates, and corals. Heavy use of activated carbon in marine aquariums can cause Head & Lateral Line Erosion disease (most often seen on fish in the Surgeonfish Family). This can be avoided by using a trace element additive in the aquarium.</p><p>Because of its large surface area per volume, activated carbon also makes a good biological filtration platform. Pelletized carbon is used in the DIY carbon tube filter with excellent results. When activated carbon is placed in a Canister Filter, is also serves as a biological Filter.</p><h2>Filtration Methods Using Activated Carbon </h2><p>In order for the carbon to be effective, water must flow over/through the carbon material. Activated carbon is used in a number of aquarium filtration systems. As stated earlier, activated carbon can be placed in one or more of the chambers of canister filters or in a Carbon Tube. Replaceable filter pads in most power filters incorporate granulated carbon in the pads. Carbon can be spread in a Wet/Dry Trickle Filter tray (pelletized carbon works better here). Mesh bags can also be filled with carbon and placed in the aquarium water flow area in a sump.</p><h2>How Often Should Carbon Be Used? </h2><p>The two main concerns about using carbon in a saltwater system are that carbon often leaches phosphate into the aquarium and that it removes necessary trace elements needed by reef animals, particularly corals.</p><h3>The Phosphate Leaching Issue </h3><p>As far as phosphate goes, you want to remove this element from your tank, not add it. A high phosphate accumulation in saltwater aquariums can lead to aggressive hair algae blooms that are difficult to get rid of, and since some brands of carbon may leach phosphate into an aquarium, you should test the carbon you are using or going to use for leaching. If you find any relevant traces, you can change to a different brand, or remove the phosphates from your system either by using a phosphate removing product or use the vodka method.</p><h3>The Trace Element Absorption </h3><p>There has been an ongoing controversy amongst aquarist for years if you should use carbon continuously, just when needed, or even at all. The trend leans towards using carbon only when there is really a reason its use is warranted, because a healthy system, particularly one that has an adequate protein skimmer installed should not require it. Richard Harker's iodide absorption test results lead him to conclude that, ""the use of carbon has minimal impact on iodide concentrations and that passive use of carbon has no lesser effect on iodide levels than active use.""</p><p>Our conclusion here is that if you decide to use Activated Carbon on a continuous basis and are concerned about the possible loss of trace elements, add some trace element supplements in conjunction with the activated carbon, as well as bypass the water flow through the carbon for a short period of time before and after supplements have been added to allow it to be absorbed by the reef life and not the carbon.</p><h2>How Much Carbon Should Be Used? </h2><p>More is not always best, and using the least amount of carbon necessary is recommended. The general consensus here is that a quantity of about 3 level tablespoons of carbon per 50 gallons of actual tank water volume should be sufficient to keep a saltwater aquarium or reef tank system color free.</p><h2>How Often Should Carbon Be Changed? </h2><p>Like most other absorbing compounds, carbon can only absorb as much as it can hold. Once it has taken in as much as it can, it becomes exhausted, which means it is unable to absorb anything more. For this reason, it needs to be changed and replaced or rejuvenated for reuse. Not all aquariums run the same, so as far as determining when to change the carbon, this is something you will have to figure out on your own. By sight, you definitely know it's time when the aquarium water begins to get a yellow tinge to it, but there are ways to test it as well. The bottom line is that it's best to use smaller amounts changed more often. Take into consideration; not changing all the carbon too quickly if your water is significantly yellow, as this can expose corals to too much UV light abruptly which can lead to coral bleaching and possible death.</p>",948
66,https://www.thesprucepets.com/diy-carbon-tube-filtration-system-2924625,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Live Rock Filtration & Systems,<h1>DIY Carbon Tube Filtration System</h1>,"<h1>DIY Carbon Tube Filtration System</h1><p>The concept of the Carbon Tube Filtration System is really quite simple. The Tri Base Pelletized Carbon (TBPC) is put into a PVC tube through which a high volume of tank water is pumped after it has been mechanically filtered. Right Now Bacteria (RN) is an aerobic bacterial compound, which means it ""lives by oxygen supply"".</p><p>When picking your mechanical filter and pump, you want water flow through the carbon tubes that will turn over the tank water at a rate of six to 10 times per hour. Do not forget to take into factor that the flow rate will be slower than what the filter instructions say due to the water flow through the carbon tubes. Once the aquarium water passes through the canister filter and the carbon tubes, the water is returned to the tank free of Nitrogen wastes.</p><h2>For Smaller Aquariums Under 55 Gallons  </h2><p>For smaller aquariums, under 55 gallons a Magnum 350, Eheim, Fluval, or similar pump works well. These canister filters act as both your mechanical pre-filter and water pump in one unit. For tanks that are in the range of about 75 gallons, you can choose to use two Magnum 350's (for example), each one with one carbon tube attached.</p><h2>For Aquariums Over 75 Gallons  </h2><p>If your tank is over 75 gallons you will want to go to a larger capacity water pump with a separate canister filter to use as a mechanical pre-filter to help remove debris that can clog the TBPC making it less efficient. The Mag Drive, Little Giant, Iwaki, and Rainbow make pumps in the range of 1000 to 1800 gallons per hour. There are a number of mechanical filters, like Ocean Clear, on the market which can be used as a pre-filter.</p><p>The following is our interpretation of Dave's ""Theory of Carbon Tube Filtration"", with a couple of extra features with associated benefits Dave never got around to putting on paper.</p><h2>DIY Carbon Tube Filter Material List </h2><p>The PVC tubes can be of any diameter you wish. Keep in mind 10 pounds of TBPC occupies 0.35 cubic feet. 87 inches of three-inch PVC or 49 inches of four-inch PVC will hold 10 pounds of TBPC. Hiatt Distributors Limited recommends 0.1667 pounds of TBPC for each gallon of tank water for the best results. Our customers have great results with somewhat less, but then again, more TBPC means faster cycle time and more fish in your tank, to a point. </p><h2>Materials You'll Need </h2><p>If you have a few challenges finding some of the same materials here, be sure to research the additional tips for construction. It's also important to understand how to pre-flush the carbon tubes to remove possible carbon residue, what you can do if you encounter leakage and a few other helpful tips. </p><h2>DIY Carbon Tube Filter Construction </h2><p>If the tubes are tightly filled with the TBPC, they can be horizontal. If they are loosely packed, they must be vertical (with downward water flow). The shape of the TBPC doesn't allow it to pack, so you can fill the tubes with as much as you desire.</p><h2>Starting the Carbon Tube </h2><p>If you want to ""tweak"" your tank, add another tube to the chain and put Hiatt's pH Adjustment Rock and Metal Gone (MG) in it. MG is used to eliminate or avoid any hair-micro algae problems. </p><h2>Carbon Tube Maintenance and Tank Cleaning </h2><p>Maintenance is a breeze. Clean or change your mechanical filter cartridge once a week (more if needed) and vacuum siphon and clean your substrate once a week. The Magnum brand filter has an attachable Power Kleen Gravel Washer specifically for this purpose. Just unhook the Magnum intake hose, attach the gravel washer and ""vacuum"" the bottom of the tank. Shut off the Magnum, replace the cartridge (keep two, one for in the filter and one for rotating), hook the intake hose back up and turn it on again. Clean the extra cartridge and hang it out to dry until the next ""maintenance"" spat.</p><p>After a period of time, the carbon can start to compact. It needs to be loosened up so that the proper water flow through the carbon is allowed. If the carbon becomes compacted and clogged, this may allow for anaerobic bacteria to grow, which you do not want. At least once a month during a routine water change just backflush the carbon tubes. Hiatt strongly recommends back flushing the carbon tubes for no more than 10 to 15 seconds. </p><p>The greatest benefit of this system is that it is so easy and inexpensive to modify, add on to, reduce your filtration system and finally have the complete Nitrogen Cycle. No need to buy skimmers or any other ""do-holly's"" to get an effect, unless you choose to add them. No doubt you already have the pump and a bunch of extra tubes laying around. Just mix and match to your heart's content.</p><p>One of the greatest things about this hobby is that everyone can be a ""research scientist"", doing their own experiments, using their imaginations to attempt proving a theory. And, make sure that you keep a tank log. Use the Aquarium Manager Program or a similar computer program.</p><h2>Additional Construction Notes </h2><h2>DIY Carbon Tube </h2><p>Here is a constructed DIY carbon tube and it's associated stand. This tube was built from 4"" PVC and is to be used vertically. You can see the stand for the carbon tube in front of the tube.</p>",896
67,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-live-sand-is-2921059,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Live Rock Filtration & Systems,<h1>Using Live Sand in a Saltwater Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>Using Live Sand in a Saltwater Aquarium</h1><p>Live sand is natural reef coral sand that is collected live from the ocean or non-living coral sand that is cultured to make it live. What makes it live is the microscopic biological bacteria that grows on it, and the many tiny crustaceans and other micro and macro-organisms that reside in it. Live sand can serve as the main base for biological filtration in a saltwater aquarium, while the organisms help consume organic matter in the sand bed. Some of the organisms provide a natural food source for many aquarium inhabitants as well.</p><h2>What Type of Live Sand to Use </h2><p>There are many types of sand (live or nonliving) to choose from, but the best is sand made from coral, such as coral sand, reef sand, crushed coral or aragonite. One top choice of many expert aquarists is Aragonite by . Some sand sources other than aragonite types may have silicates in them, which you do not want in your aquarium. Silicates cause algae problems, and once introduced are next to impossible to remove.</p><h2>Pure Live Sand vs. Seeding </h2> <p>If you have a new aquarium in the initial stages of the nitrogen cycling process or one that's still in the process of completing its cycle, you can use the seeding method to kick-start or speed up of this transition. For an aquarium that has been running for some time, seeding can also enhance the strength of its existing biological filter base.</p><h2>How Much LS to Use </h2><p>Unless you are going to be using the Jaubert/Plenum method of filtration, you should avoid excessive amounts of live sand. The sand bed becomes too thick, which allows unwanted dissolved organic compounds to get trapped, contributing to the growth of undesirable micro-and macro-algae.</p><p>As you can see, there is some variation among the recommended amounts, and, indeed, different tanks will need different amounts. But the bottom line is that a layer between 1/2 inch and 2 inches covering the bottom of the tank should be sufficient. </p><h2>Purchasing Live Sand  </h2><p>How can you be sure you're getting live sand or dead sand? This is a good question. With live rock, you can see that it is live, but not so with live sand. The best way to ensure good-quality live sand is to purchase it from a reputable supplier that collects it directly from the ocean or specializes in cultured live sand and offers fast shipping; the shorter transit time the better. You can also buy live sand from an established local fish store, but this might be costly.</p><p>Just like with live rock, some die-off will take place during shipping, and the live sand will most likely go through a cycling process of some kind. How much cycling is necessary depends on the viability of the live sand when it was shipped and how much die-off takes place during transit.</p><h2>Adding Live Sand to the Aquarium </h2><p>If you are using live rock in the aquarium, it's best to elevate the rocks off the bare bottom of the tank. Many marine animals burrow into the sand. As they do so, any rocks that sit on top of the sand will slowly get lower and lower in the substrate as it gets displaced. Allowing the sand to be placed ""under"" the rocks prevents them from getting buried deeper in the sand, eventually ending up sitting on the bare bottom of the tank. It also prevents the rocks from being dislodged, and it prevents stacked rockscapes from becoming unstable.</p><p>Once you are done aqua-scaping and elevating the live rock, or any other large-sized decorative non-living corals or rocks, it's time to add the substrate. Add the live sand slowly to prevent excessive clouding of the water. If you are using live rocks in the tank, do not pour the sand onto the rocks, as this will smother the live rock and cause oxygen depletion. </p><h2>Live Sand Substrate Maintenance </h2><p>The aquarium should include inhabitants that will stir or turn over the live sand. These animals are referred to as sand stirrers (or sifters) or tank/reef janitors, custodians or cleaners. Recommended types of detritivores include hermit crabs, shrimp, crab, sea urchins, sea cucumbers, and starfish, For sand-sifting fish, try gobies, mandarin fish, or jawfish. </p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Before adding janitors of any kind, it's important to learn about them first. Do your research on animal compatibility and dietary requirements (especially when it comes to the fish named). Also make sure that the animals you choose are not toxic, like some cucumbers are, or otherwise hazardous to other tank inhabitants.</p><p>With the right mix and quantity of reef janitors, a live sand bed should not need to be deep siphon cleaned. Of course, it's still important to follow good a maintenance routine, and you should siphon any uneaten foods or excess debris from the ""surface"" of the sand bed and between rocks whenever needed. </p><p>In general, working with live sand is similar to working with live rock. Test the water parameters to monitor what is happening in the aquarium. Add new occupants slowly (one or two at a time) and only when the tank has completely settled through the cycling process or any recycling that may occur after any type of new introduction. Patience and time are key: Take it slow and let it grow.</p>",852
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/about-using-canister-filters-2920926,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Live Rock Filtration & Systems,<h1>About Using Canister Filters</h1>,"<h1>About Using Canister Filters</h1><p>Used for mechanical, chemical, and/or biological filtration in saltwater aquarium systems, canister filters are quite versatile. A canister filter can be used continuously or added and run only when needed. They can act as a stand-alone filter or used in combination with other types of filtration as well. Here are some examples for each category.</p><h2>For Mechanical Filtration </h2><p>An aquarist with an under gravel filter can add a hang-on-tank canister filter to the system to remove free-floating particulate matter from the water that would normally get drawn down into and trapped in the substrate. By continually running a canister filter on this type of aquarium set-up, it contributes to improved water quality.</p><p>An aquarist that has a semi-reef system with fish and some live rock in it can choose to install a canister filter in line to act as a ""pre-filter"" to remove unwanted waste, particulates, and detritus from their tank water before it passes into or through their biological filter (i.e. wet/dry trickle) or main tank water supply, such as into a sump. This can also be done on full reef tanks with live rock and corals in them, but the debate about continually running mechanical filtration in this type of system is that such a set-up filters out beneficial plankton life in the water that many marine organisms feed on.</p><p>Hang-on-tank canister filters are very often only used as a means of mechanical filtration during regular tank cleaning and maintenance care routines. They are also one of the simplest ways to control heavy copepod and amphipod larval blooms. You know, those little white bugs you often see swimming or crawling around in your aquarium.</p><h2>For Chemical Filtration </h2><p>For an aquarist that needs some help in clearing up a water quality problem, he or she can place granular activated carbon (GAC) in the media chamber to help eliminate odors, medications, or other contaminants in the water as well as use other types of absorbing products that are designed to remove nitrates, phosphates, silicates, and other unwanted chemical elements or compounds. This type of filtration also applies to the filtering of fresh tap water before using it to make-up sea salt mixes or adding it to an aquarium as top-off water.</p><h2>For Biological Filtration </h2><p>Even though many canister filters are designed for biological filtration and a lot of aquarists use them in this way, they're not the best choice as a ""main"" source for biological filtration. They may be OK for smaller systems, but most do not have a chamber big enough to hold a sufficient amount of bio-media in them for larger ones. Therefore, they are inadequate to use solely for this reason, but one can still be run in conjunction with another form of biological filters, such as with live rock or a wet/dry trickle filter, for additional mechanical filtration of the aquarium water.</p><p>Now, one of the most important things to consider when purchasing a canister filter is the water flow rate, not based on what the manufacturer says you will get, but what you will get after considering a few other factors.</p><h2>Water Flow Rate Considerations </h2><p>The flow rate on the manufacturer's instructions is reflected as an empty filter with zero head pressure (the canister is not having to pump water uphill). Two basic factors will affect or diminish the flow rate of a canister filter.</p><p>Taking the above two factors into consideration, the exact water flow rate can be determined after you buy a canister filter and have it up and running on your aquarium, or you can get an estimate by applying the flow rate equation in determining GPH water flow rates before you buy one. If after getting your estimate and considering the other factors you are still not sure if your choice is a good one or not, it doesn't hurt to purchase a larger filter than you think you will need. You can never turn your tank water over too many times, but you can have a problem with not turning the water over enough because this can result in poor water quality. A rate of six to 10 times per hour of tank water turnover time is recommended.</p><h2>Other Feature Considerations </h2><p>There are many brands of canister filters on the market to choose from. Some of the most popular traditional canisters are Eheim, Fluval, and Magnum, just to name a few. No matter what brand you buy, each manufacturer has its distinctive characteristics in design, so doing your research on the different types is very important. Some are designed with special features, such as ones that use powder or diatomaceous earth to step the filtration up to very fine levels. Robert Fenner says these types can be sub-classified as ""pressurized filters"" that can jack up your electric bill, so they are better used periodically rather than continually.</p><p>The best way to figure out what kind of canister filter you need is to determine what function you want it to accomplish, then decide from there which kind you should buy.</p><p>Another factor that can contribute to a canister filter not running at top efficiency and slow the water flow rate is ignoring proper or regular cleaning of the unit.</p><p>Here are some maintenance tips that will help prevent or lessen the further diminishing of a canister filter's water flow rate and operating efficiency.</p>",868

In most cases, this isn't so. If you have a functioning freshwater aquarium system you may already have most of the equipment required to make the conversion to a fantastic saltwater aquarium system. Let's quickly go through the pieces of equipment that you will need to start your new saltwater aquarium system.</p><h2>The Aquarium Itself </h2><p>Obviously, if you are converting from a freshwater aquarium to a saltwater aquarium, you already have an aquarium. Is it glass or acrylic? It doesn't really matter, as long as it holds water without leaking. The size of the aquarium does matter, though. For the most part (there are exceptions) the larger the aquarium for a saltwater aquarium, the better. With a smaller (10 gallon or less) aquarium, when a problem comes up, things can get worse in a hurry as there is little ""buffer room"" for mistakes and problems. Issues such as dangerously high ammonia during cycling will need to be fixed rapidly.</p><p>One thing that many freshwater aquarists don't initially understand is that you just can't put as many saltwater fish in a certain sized tank as you can a freshwater tank. The freshwater ""rule of thumb"" for the number of fish in a tank is 1"" of adult body length fish per gallon of tank water. The saltwater ""rule of thumb"" is 1"" of fish for every 5 gallons of tank water.</p><h2>Substrate </h2><p>Most freshwater aquariums use gravel for the substrate. In saltwater aquariums, sand or crushed coral is used for the substrate. While gravel will work in a saltwater aquarium for a portion of the biological filter bed, sand or crushed coral works better for the various critters (i.e. sand sifting fish and invertebrates) that will occupy the reef tank. Crushed coral or other calcium-containing substrates will also help stabilize the water quality.</p><h2>Filters and Filtration </h2><p>Canister filters work quite well in saltwater aquariums. They provide enough filtration flexibility to allow the aquarist to add or subtract different filtration options (mechanical, chemical and biological) by changing the media in the baskets within the canister to suit their needs.</p><p>Under Gravel Filters (U.G.F.'s), which are still used in many freshwater (and even saltwater) aquarium setups are considered a thing of the past, except for certain applications, such as systems requiring low water flow. U.G.F.'s require quite a bit of maintenance in order to keep them clean and free of nitrate producing tank materials such as uneaten food and detritus.</p><h2>Pumps and Powerheads </h2><p>Most freshwater aquariums do not utilize powerheads or pumps to create a surge or wave effect, but virtually all pumps and powerheads used in aquariums are suitable in either fresh or saltwater.</p><h2>Lights and Lighting </h2><p>The lights used on an FW tank are usually standard or NO (Normal Output) fluorescent bulbs, which will work fine for a fish-only or fish-only-with-live-rock saltwater tank. However, you might consider adding an actinic blue bulb alongside one of the standard tubes, or change over to 50/50s, as these type of fluorescent bulbs greatly enhance the visual look of the tank and the colors of the fishes.</p><p>If you are planning to have a reef tank, you will need to upgrade your freshwater lighting to accommodate corals and some other invertebrates such as anemones that require a higher quality light in the right spectrum range. The fairly recent advent of L.E.D. lighting for aquariums has made high-quality reef tank lighting not only possible but also cost-effective (low power consumption and 50,000-hour bulb life).</p><p>Other considerations are the material from which the light hood is made, which may not hold up to the corrosive effects of SW, and if you want to upgrade to VHO, PC, or MH lighting, the standard aquarium hood will not hold those bulbs. If you are planning a reef system, lighting becomes much more critical and expensive. Spend some time researching your potential lighting needs before running down to your LFS and laying out a lot of your hard-earned cash. It has been our experience that the average salesperson working in an LFS doesn't have a clue to what the lighting requirements are for a reef system, which usually results in you ending up with either inadequate or unnecessary equipment.</p><h2>Aquarium Heaters </h2><p>In all likelihood the heater(s) being used won't need to be replaced, just make sure this equipment is rated as safe for use in saltwater, particularly under-gravel cable type units that are often used in freshwater plant aquariums.</p><h2>Decorations </h2><p>With the exception of large stones or rocks, most freshwater tank decorations are useless in saltwater aquariums, and some items such as plastic plants can even be dangerous to marine life. Most marine fish are ""grazers"" and have a tendency to nibble on everything, and it doesn't take too many eaten fragments of plastic to totally shut down a fish's digestive tract. As far as items like castles, bubbling divers, and sunken chests, if you are a ""true"" saltwater naturalist, adding these types of things is unheard of. Appropriate types of decorative rocks and corals, either non-living or synthetic, are generally used for decorating saltwater tanks if you are not planning on adding live rock and/or keeping a coral reef system.</p><p>All in all, conversion from a freshwater to a saltwater tank isn't all that complicated. Of course, the biggest difference is the need to add sea salt to the water to create a marine environment. Additional items needed besides the sea salt will be a hydrometer to measure the salinity, water test kits, saltwater aquarium books, and a few other supplies, but by being able to use ""some"" of the equipment you already have, you're off to a pretty good start.</p>",980
71,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aquarium-sizes-and-weights-1380694,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquarium Basics,<h1>How Size Affects Aquarium Weight</h1>,"<h1>How Size Affects Aquarium Weight</h1><h2>A 180-gallon fish tank weighs over 1 ton</h2> <p>Aquariums come in many sizes from as small as 2.5 gallons to as large as 180 gallons or more. That is a wide range, so finding the right one for you is going to depend on your goals and your level of experience.</p><p>Fish aquariums can be surprisingly heavy when they are full of water, so before filling a new or used aquarium, it is best to know how heavy it will be so you can ensure the table, cabinet and even the floor itself is up to the load. </p><h2>Basic Aquarium Sizes </h2><p>The charts below detail the most common aquarium sizes, including size and empty weight information in U.S. units, as well as the weight when the tank is filled with water. This is an important consideration, especially for larger tanks. Keep in mind that one gallon of water weighs 8.34 pounds, so you need to ensure that your cabinet and floor can handle the weight of your aquarium. A 180-gallon aquarium, when filled with water, gravel and accessories, weighs over 2,000 pounds.</p><p>This information will also help you guide several decisions, such as determining how much space is required, how much substrate and lighting you will need, recommended filter sizes, and other equipment needs. Also, keep in mind that the surface area of the water in the tank will determine how many fish you can stock.</p><p>The weights given are for glass aquariums; acrylic aquariums will weigh somewhat less. Also, exact dimensions can vary by brand and the trim used on the aquarium. To be more precise, it is best to take a tape measure with you to the fish store to get exact measurements of your choice of tank and double-check that all your accessories particularly tank hoods and cabinets fit properly.</p><h2>Small Aquariums </h2><p>Contrary to what you might think, small aquariums are not recommended for beginners. These small environments can be very temperamental, so a tiny change in the chemistry of the water, like ammonia or pH changes, can have a big impact.</p><p>If you do decide to keep a small fish tank, keep in mind that it will have a much smaller biofiltration capacity, so it is important that you do not overstock it with too many fish. Also, because it is such a sensitive environment, good filtration is absolutely essential for small tanks.</p><h2>Mid-Sized Aquariums </h2><p>These are the aquariums that are most often recommended for beginners. Anything in the 20- to 40- gallon range has a sufficient volume that will minimize harmful effects due to chemistry changes in the water and will be large enough to handle a nice stock of fish.  </p><p>Also, these tanks are not so large that cleaning will be difficult. This is important because many people who are new to aquariums find that keeping up with maintenance soon becomes overwhelming. Overall, the mid-sized tanks are a nice, manageable size.</p><h2>Large Aquariums </h2><p>The larger the aquarium, the more fish you can stock. That is a decided advantage, but it also means that you will have to work harder to maintain these tanks. You also have to be concerned with tanks of this size when it comes to weight when filled. You need to make sure your floor and cabinet can handle such heavy loads. Owners of very large tanks may even find that floor reinforcement is necessary to support a load that is in excess of one ton.</p><p>Bigger tanks have a great appeal, especially when you want to create a diverse aquarium. However, you also need to consider the tank's scale in relation to the room and its surroundings. Is there enough room for hoses and accessories between the tank and wall? Is it a high-traffic room? Are there space constraints that might lead to accidents and broken glass? Do you have shelves overhanging the tank that may fall down and create an emergency for your fish? These are important questions to ask before making such a significant investment with your time and money.</p><h2>Calculating Weight of Custom-Shaped Tanks </h2><p>In addition to basic rectangles, fish tanks may be in the shape of hexagons, pentagons, or even cylinders. If you are buying such a tank, the volume in gallons will already be specified and you can use the charts above to calculate the empty and full weight of the tank. A 50-gallon fish tank will have the same weight measurements whether it is rectangular, hexagonal, or cylindrical in shape.</p><p>But if you are buying or have been given a used tank and do not know the gallon size, calculating the gallon volume and weight of the tank is really just a matter of first calculating the cubic inches of volume.</p><p>If you can determine the volume of any tank in cubic inches, then it is easy enough to translate that into a gallon capacity. Once you've determined the gallon capacity, use the charts above to estimate the empty and full weight of the tank.</p><p>To determine volume requires a little math. The volume of a tank is determined by first figuring out the area of the base shape in square inches, then multiplying this by the height. The easiest way to do this is to sketch out the shape of the base, then divide it into shapes that have areas that can easily be calculated. For example, a hexagon can be divided into rectangles and triangles. Calculate the area of each shape in inches and then add them together to figure the area of the tank's base shape. Multiply this number by the height of the tank to calculate the total volume in cubic inches. Next, divide the total cubic-inch volume by 231 to find the gallon capacity of the tank. Finally, find a corresponding gallon capacity in the charts above to find the approximate weight for your tank. </p><p>Aquarium Water Quality: Nitrogen Cycle.</p>",957

Everything in the ocean is competing for something in order to stay alive, eat and reproduce. The five basic types of competition are: Predator/Prey, Territory Protection, Mate & Status Protection, Spawn Protection and Opportunistic Feeding Behavior.</p><h3>Predator or Prey </h3><p>The recipients of this type of aggressive behavior are perceived as food organisms, such as a Dragon Moray Eel (Enchelycore pardalis) consuming an ornamental shrimp, or a Lionfish consuming a small Damselfish. This category is pretty much self explanatory. It is obvious that keeping larger predatory fish with anything small enough that they can perceive as food is not a wise idea. Many aquarists choose to keep these types of fish in a specific predatory tank community, with fish like large Groupers, Hawks, Snappers and other predatory species.</p><h3>Territory Protection  </h3><p>The recipient of this type of aggressive behavior are others of the same or similar species, such as a juvenile Angelfish and Jewelfish attacking others. When it comes to territorial aggression, most fish react in the same way, especially when you already have fish established in an aquarium and you add in a new tank mate later on. Generally, when you place all new fish into an aquarium at the same time, a few disputes will occur until territories are established. Once that is done, the fish usually settle down and life goes on. The problem of ""harassment"" will most likely occur whenever you put a new fish into an established aquarium community, and most often it doesn't seem to matter what type or species of fish it is.</p><h3>Mate and Status Protection </h3><p>The recipient of this type of aggressive behavior are other fish of the same species, such as a mated pair of Clownfish attacking others. It is interesting that most species exhibit this type of behavior. For example, if you put a mated pair of Angelfish, Butterflyfish, Boxfish, or just about any other type of mated species in a tank, and then add another male or female of the same species later, typically the same sexed fish will go after the same sexed fish that was newly introduced. Limiting a tank to one specific mated species is wise.</p><h3>Spawn Protection </h3><p>The recipient of this type of aggressive behavior are all other fish near a nest area, such as Damselfish protecting their spawn from other fish that may stray into their nesting area. It helps to keep fish that spawn in captivity in larger sized aquariums, and provide ample housing not only for the nesting species, but all the other tank inhabitants as well. Pelagic or ""free-spawning"" fish, such as the Yellow Tang, do not demonstrate this type of behavior.</p><h3>Opportunistic Feeding Behavior  </h3><p>The recipient of this type of aggressive behavior are all other fish and invertebrates. A good example of this behavior are Triggerfishes, which will eat just about anything. Fish that have this type of behavior are best kept in a specific aggressive species tank community. Many times aquarists will keep Triggers with other Triggers, as well as Lions, Groupers, Hawks, Snappers, and other larger predatory species.</p><p>Before adding any new livestock to your tank, it is wise to learn about their particular behavior patterns in order to avoid competition which will end up in your losing some of your valuable fish and/or invertebrates.</p>",799
73,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ways-to-control-nitrate-in-aquariums-2925184,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquarium Filters,<h1>Nitrates in Saltwater Aquariums</h1>,"<h1>Nitrates in Saltwater Aquariums</h1><p>Nitrate is the waste by-product of nitrifying bacteria (Nitrobacter), which develops in the final phase of the nitrogen cycling process. It is what makes an aquarium's biological filtration system function and stay in balance.</p><h2>Why Is Nitrate a Problem Element? </h2><p>When nitrate is allowed to accumulate or build-up to high levels it can affect the health of the animals you are keeping, and because marine plants and algae feed on nitrate, this is one of the main reasons problems with algae blooms occur.</p><h2>What Is an Acceptable Level? </h2><p>By many accounts, the optimal amount of nitrate in any type of saltwater system is an immeasurable one, but an acceptable range for fish-only tanks is from 10 to 40 ppm. Although fish-only tanks may run at much higher levels, sometimes with no ill effects, this is not recommended. In reef systems, even a minor level of nitrate can cause damage as well as death to delicate corals, anemones, and other invertebrates, as well as some crustaceans. The acceptable range of nitrate for reef tanks is 0.25 ppm, but not more than 5 ppm.</p><h2>Other Sources of Nitrate </h2><p>Even though nitrate is a natural element in aquariums, when doing water changes and topping-off the tank to replace water lost from evaporation, if using unpurified tap water and/or a brand of sea salt mix that may contain a high level of this element in it, instead of reducing the nitrate, you can just be putting it right back into the aquarium. Therefore, it is wise to filter tap water before using it and choose what sea salt you are going to use carefully.</p><h2>Nitrate Control </h2><p>Nitrate control isn't as hard as you might think. Consider regular aquarium maintenance care first. If that doesn't work, pick a nitrate control method and give it a try. If after a while you do not get the desired results you are looking for, try another one, and keep trying until you find one that works for your system.</p><h2>Controlling Nitrates With Mangrove Plants </h2><p>The key factor in controlling nitrate primarily relates to how you take care of your aquarium. At various stages in the life of a saltwater aquarium, from a newly cycled tank to a well established one, you should set up a regular maintenance care routine that is suitable for your particular system.</p><h2>Using Mangrove Plants </h2><p>The use of mangrove plants in saltwater aquarium systems to reduce and control nitrate is not a new concept by any means. This method of filtration has been around for some time, but with the popularity of wanting to find ""natural"" ways to take care of an aquarium, mangroves are being discovered as an excellent no-chemicals-or-additives-needed way to do it.</p><h2>Natural Nitrate Reduction (NNR) Filtration Setups </h2><p>The principle of NNR or Natural Nitrate Reduction filtration is that the nitrifying bacteria do all the work.</p><h2>Using Denitrator Units, Absorption Compounds, and Additives </h2><h2>Denitrator Units </h2><p>Coil, flat block, and other types of denitrators are similar to the NNR setups that work on the principle that the nitrifying bacteria that grow in them do all the work. Although these units are very effective, they can be an expensive investment, but if you are a do-it-yourselfer, you can always make your own denitrator unit.</p><h2>Nitrate Removing Compounds and Additives </h2><p>In the quest to find quick solutions to nitrate problems, one can opt to use various types of removing or absorption compounds and chemical additives to get rid of it. There are many types of products on the market that are designed to absorb nitrate, as well as other undesirable elements in aquarium water such as nuisance phosphates and silicates.</p><h2>Multiple Water Change Reduction Method </h2><p>Reducing or keeping nitrates in check through small partial water changes over a while is effective, but when the levels are dangerously high, this process cannot give you the results you immediately need. As an experiment, we allowed the nitrates in our aquarium rise to a very high level, literally off the scale, and then performed a multiple-step water change procedure that we had contemplated trying out for some time. We found it to be very efficient, quickly lowering the nitrates to zero in a day.</p><p>Rapid nitrate reduction is said by some aquarists to be just as harmful to the tank inhabitants as the high nitrates themselves, but we experienced no ill effects in this regard. It worked so well for us the first time that we use this multiple-step water change procedure whenever we make a water change. If ill effects of rapid nitrate reduction are a concern, you can do this type of water change over a longer period, rather than all in one day.</p><h2>Long Term Nitrate Reduction </h2><p>Another reliable, but the heretofore unheralded method in the saltwater aquarium hobby is the use of the combination of Hiatt's Right Now! (RN!) bacteria and a quantity of activated carbon in the tank's filtration system. There is a specific bacteria strain in the RN! which reacts with Nitrates and an element in the TBPC, converting the nitrates into Nitrogen gas, which is then vented into the atmosphere via the water's surface.</p><h2>The Vodka Method for Nitrate and Phosphate Reduction </h2><p>The ""Vodka Method for Nitrate Reduction"" uses the same principle as the "" Long-Term Nitrate Reduction."" However, instead of using activated carbon for the carbon source, it utilizes the organic carbon found in alcohol. As Charles Delbeek explained it: ""the ""vodka method"" is a means to add inorganic carbon in the form of alcohol to cause bacteria to grow. In boosting bacterial growth, nitrate and phosphate are incorporated by the bacteria, lowering these values in the water. The excess bacteria are then either removed through skimming or are consumed by other organisms, such as sponges.""</p>",942
74,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mechanical-filtration-1380933,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquarium Filters,<h1>Everything to Know About Mechanical Filtration for Your Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>Everything to Know About Mechanical Filtration for Your Aquarium</h1><p>There are three categories of filtration: biological, chemical, and mechanical. Mechanical is generally the least often discussed, possibly because it's the most simple, and deemed less critical than the other types. However, mechanical filtration is an important part of the overall health and stability of your aquarium. Knowing the basics of mechanical filtration will help you avoid filtration problems in your aquarium, and understand how to deal with them if they should occur.</p><h2>What Mechanical Filtration Does </h2><p>YouTube</p><p>Mechanical filtration physically traps particles of uneaten food, fish waste, decayed plant materials, and other debris in the aquarium water. Mechanical filtration is the first stage of the filtration process, and should always be placed so that water coming from the tank hits this media first. Keep in mind that most mechanical media also promotes the colonization of beneficial bacteria, particularly in the case of sponges or pads. Although biological filtration is not the primary function of this media, cleaning or changing this media will impact the biological capability of the filter.</p><h2>Types of Mechanical Filtration Media </h2><p>There are several types of filtration media, which are somewhat dependent on the type of filter they are used in. Some filters have pads, others have sponges, and some are packed with filter wool. In some cases, the mechanical filter media is fashioned to also hold the chemical filtration media, as in the case of cartridge media used in some power filters. These materials have openings that range from coarse to fine, thus allowing different degrees of filtration based on the pore size. Some filters will have multiple layers of mechanical media, with the most course being placed first in the water flow to remove large particles first. Ultrafine pore pads should be placed in the last position of the filter, to ""polish"" the water of tiny debris before the water is returned to the aquarium.</p><h2>Pads </h2><p>Sponges, pads, or foam blocks are used in all canister filters and some power filters. They are sold in rectangles, squares, or circles that match the opening in the filter basket. Some may have several pore sizes available, which should be matched to the purpose for which they are used. Read the product information carefully to ensure you are getting the proper pore size, as very fine pore size will clog too quickly for first stage filtration. There are also filter sponges made to fit on a powerhead or filter intake to reduce the water flow as well as provide filtration. These are particularly helpful in grow-out tanks for small fry</p><h2>Filter Floss </h2><p>Filter wool or floss is used in a variety of filters. It originated in the days when we had the old style in the tank box filters, where it was stuffed into the filter box. It may not have been too attractive once it started collecting debris, but it worked. Although box filters are rarely used anymore, filter wool has continued to be used in canister and wet/dry sump or trickle filters. It is also used by some enthusiasts in interesting ways. For instance, those who do not care for carbon filtration will remove the carbon from a filter cartridge and stuff it will filter floss.</p><h2>Combo Cartridge </h2> <p>Often power filters will combine the mechanical and chemical media into a single cartridge. The exterior of the cartridge provides mechanical filtration, while the media inside provides chemical filtration. Some of these cartridges can be opened, thus allowing the internal chemical media to be replaced. Others do not open and must be discarded and replaced with a new cartridge once the chemical media inside is exhausted.</p><p>As a side note, it is a myth that carbon media can be recharged through boiling or baking in the oven. Carbon media should be discarded and replaced regularly. Some cartridges even go so far as to have finer mechanical media on the backside of the filter, to polish the water. Whenever using cartridge media, read the manufacturer's instructions carefully to become familiar with the proper way to mount and service the cartridge.</p><h2>Changing Mechanical Media </h2><p> Pexels</p><p>Over time, mechanical media will trap more and more particulate matter, slowly reducing the water flow through the filter. A common mistake made with filters is to never clean or change the media. If not maintained, eventually the mechanical media will become so clogged that the water flow will slow to a trickle or even stop altogether. If this happens, any biological colonies within the filter will die off fairly quickly, due to the lack of oxygenation. Another problem that occurs when filter media becomes full of waste is that the debris begins to decompose, releasing harmful toxins into the water. Such events can, and should, be avoided for the sake of maintaining a healthy biological balance in the aquarium. Mechanical media must be washed or replaced regularly.</p><p>Because of the impact on the biological colonies, it's generally best to rotate the cleaning regimen in such a way that not all biologicals are disturbed at the same time. For instance, don't replace the filter media, at the same time as performing heavy substrate vacuuming.</p>",844

You think to yourself, what am I going to put in it? You recall that you really liked that fish you saw in the store the other day, you know, the one that had all the bright colors. You remember it was so beautiful and very expensive, and at this point, you ask yourself,</p><p>Aside from being new to the hobby and having much yet to learn, for you to go out on a limb and spend this kind of money for a fish to put into a newly started aquarium is absurd, and don't let your local fish store salesperson talk you into it either. If you did your homework prior to starting your new aquarium, you know that the cycling period (the time it takes to reduce high levels of ammonia and nitrite that are toxic to fish, as well as all other animals) takes several weeks for establishing the biological filter in the aquarium. Considering the threats that loom ahead for any fish for the first 30 days or so, including your lack of experience, why would anyone want to put this kind of money into a fish to cycle a tank with?</p> <p>Did you know there are ways to speed up the nitrogen cycling process to help aid in the completion of the cycle? Commercial bacteria starter products are available that add the beneficial bacteria to your aquarium to help speed the cycling process.</p><p>During the cycling period, test your water chemistry frequently to measure ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels. The most dangerous toxin that will naturally appear is ammonia, which is excreted by fish through their gills and is also created from fish waste and uneaten food. When the ammonia levels start getting a bit high, you can either perform a partial water change or treat the tank with an ammonia neutralizer to bring the levels back down into the safe zone. In order for the cycle to complete, there must always be a small amount of ammonia in the tank water, so do not continuously keep the ammonia level at zero. The small number of fish initially added are there to create the ammonia that the beneficial bacteria in the biofilter need to grow. But you don't want to risk their health by letting the ammonia or nitrite levels get too high. Do not add any more fish into the aquarium until the ammonia and nitrite levels are staying at zero, and the nitrate level is starting to rise.</p><p>Regardless of what method you use to cycle a new aquarium, the process is the same. Ammonia builds up until there are sufficient bacteria in the biological filter, gravel and on other surfaces growing to break ammonia down into nitrite. Just like ammonia, nitrite is toxic and harmful to marine animals even at lower levels. Nitrite will continue to rise to a high level until another species of bacteria grows in sufficient numbers to break down nitrite into nitrate.</p><p>These beneficial bacteria are living entities that require oxygen and food (a nitrogen source) to survive, and will grow on the surfaces of everything in the tank. The main biological activity occurs in the media of the filter because of the water flow through it bringing the bacteria the oxygenated water containing the nutrients they need. When nitrate readings begin to increase, that indicates the beneficial nitrifying bacteria are establishing themselves, which is what you have painstakingly been going through the cycling process to achieve.</p><p>At this point, it is safe to add a few more fish to the aquarium. Continue to monitor the ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate, as they will increase when you add new fish. When the ammonia and nitrite are down again after adding a few new fish, then you can add a few more fish or invertebrates until the aquarium occupancy reaches the maximum safe number of the fish you want. Keep the nitrate level down by performing partial water changes.</p>",709

Each new bacteria born consumes the previous one, and in turn, gives birth to the next bacteria.</p><p>The three components involved to make this happen are ammonia (NH  or NH +4), nitrite (NO ), and nitrate (NO ). In general, the nitrogen cycling process usually takes about 30 days, but there is no exact time frame for this process to complete its task, as each aquarium is different. Factors such as how many fish, other livestock, and organic matter is present in the tank can vary the completion time, one way or the other. Testing your aquarium water during cycling is very important, as this will tell you what phase the aquarium is in at any given time throughout the process.</p><p>It should be noted here that there are methods to Speed Up The Nitrogen Cycling Process, some of which can actually cycle the tank in as little as one day.</p><h2>The 3 Components & Phases </h2><p>There are 3 phases of the nitrogen cycling process.</p><h2>Phase 1 - Ammonia (NH  or NH +4) </h2><p>The first component needed in the chain is ammonia, and it is only during the cycling process that elevated ammonia readings should be present in an aquarium. Once ammonia begins to accumulate in the aquarium, the cycling process begins. So where do you get the ammonia from? It is produced by such things as fish and other livestock waste, excess food, and decaying organic matter from both animals and plants. Now putting live animals into a tank for the purpose of cycling is not easy, because they are exposed to highly toxic levels of ammonia and nitrite during the process. However, without ammonia present, the cycle cannot begin, and if ammonia is removed, or the supply is disrupted during cycling, the process stops. As you see the ammonia level rise during the cycling period, if you think by adding an ammonia destroyer or doing a water change to bring it down is helping, it isn't! You are only delaying the cycling process and preventing it from completing its mission. If you use fish to cycle an aquarium, it's a catch 22! You don't want to put the animals in harm's way by exposing them to toxic elements, but you need their waste as the ammonia source to get the job done. The good news is there are alternatives to cycling a new tank without having to use fish, as well as ways to help speed up the nitrogen cycling process.</p><h2>Phase 2 - Nitrite (NO ) </h2><p>At about ten days into the cycle, the nitrifying bacteria that convert ammonia into nitrite, Nitrosomonas, should begin to appear and build. Just like ammonia, nitrite can be toxic and harmful to marine animals even at lower levels, and without nitrite present, the cycling process cannot complete itself. Nitrite will continue to rise to a high level of about 15 ppm, the most critical stage, and at about day 25 the level should begin to fall off, although it's quite possible to run on for another 10 days. Most likely the nitrite reading will peak and fall off to less than 2 or 3 ppm by about day 30, and shortly thereafter to zero. If it does not, don't worry, it should drop sometime within the next 10 days or so.</p><h2>Phase 3 - Nitrate (NO ) </h2><p>Now that the ammonia has given birth to nitrite, the nitrite, in turn, give birth to the third and final nitrifying bacteria, nitrobacters. These bacteria are living entities that require oxygen and food (an ammonia source) to survive, grow on the surfaces of everything in the tank, and the waste from nitrobacter are shown in the form of nitrate with a test kit. When nitrate readings begin to increase, you can tell that these beneficial nitrifying bacteria are starting to establish themselves, which is what you have painstakingly been going through the cycling process to achieve.</p>",710

You set up your new aquarium, install all of your live rock and arrange it just right, including the perfect arch in the center of the substrate. Next, the beautiful corals are put in perfect position, so as not to offend each other, and then you carefully acclimate the perfect fish and invertebrates and turn them loose in the tank.</p><p>Everything is working wonderfully for about four weeks until all of a sudden everything is covered with a blanket of ugly brown algae. You run another battery of water chemistry tests, which show the same results that they always have: a slight trace of ammonia, zero nitrite, near zero nitrate, and a trace of phosphate. There is little food (nitrate or phosphate) for algae to feed on, so what is this ugly brown stuff, and where is it coming from? A better question is ""how do you get rid of it?"" No matter what you do, it just seems to keep growing and getting worse all the time. What you are seeing is brown diatom algae, and it is like no other algae green, red, or brown that you have ever dealt with before.</p><h2>Brown Diatom Algae </h2><p>Diatoms are unicellular algae (Class: Bacillariophyceae) that consist of many species that all have a cell wall made of silica. They are photosynthesizing (using light to produce their own food) algae, as are many other types of algae. Their yellowish-brown chloroplasts, the site of photosynthesis, are what gives them their golden brown color. Diatoms are found in the oceans, lakes, ponds, rivers, and even in damp soil and that mud puddle in your backyard. In other words, they are found anywhere there is water.</p><p>Masses of diatom skeletons made of silica have been preserved on earth in such large quantities that they have formed deep deposits that are harvested and used in filters, paints, toothpaste (think about that the next time you're standing in front of the bathroom mirror polishing your pearly whites), and many other applications.</p><p>Brown diatoms are autotrophic (capable of synthesizing their own food from inorganic substances using light or chemical energy) and therefore are restricted to areas that contain some light in order to grow and reproduce. Brown diatom algae can be found in the oceans down to depths of about 600 feet, so they won't have any problems finding enough light to multiply in your brightly lit reef tank, which may be only 24 inches deep.</p><p>Brown diatoms are often seen in new aquariums that have just completed their biological cycling process. The algae bloom may be just a light coating of brown on parts of the substrate, rocks, and aquarium walls, or it might be a complete coating. Most aquarists have dealt with this problem by siphoning the diatoms off of the substrate and rocks and brushing them off of the tank walls. Eventually, it went away, hopefully before it did any serious damage to the corals in the tank by covering and suffocating them.</p><h2>Why Remove Brown Diatom? </h2><p>There are a number of reasons to remove them from your tank and keep them from reappearing in the future, other than the fact that brown diatoms are ugly in an aquarium.</p><p>Most saltwater aquarists don't stop to think about natural ways to remove brown diatoms from their saltwater tanks. In this day and age of having a variety of chemicals and treatments for every affliction a marine (or freshwater) aquarium experiences, the little creatures that nature has produced which keep brown diatoms from over-running the planet are quickly overlooked.</p><p>Years ago, when we were collecting tropical fish on one of the outer islands in Hawaii, we had a number of glass holding tanks with under-gravel filters which produced a lot of algae. Several of the tanks always seemed to have an abundant coating of brown diatoms that would reappear after each cleaning. Some of the tanks would end up having a number of Kole Tangs () in them while they were waiting for shipment. It didn't take long for the Kole Tangs to produce a mosaic of little fish lip marks in the brown diatoms on the aquarium walls. They loved the diatoms and would probably have cleaned the whole tank if they had remained for any length of time. Being that the tanks were for simply holding the fish before shipment, the algae wasn't a great concern, but it was impressive how much diatom algae the Kole Tangs consumed in a short period of time.</p><h2>Dealing With Further Outbreaks </h2><p>Algae growth is pretty much a normal thing for new aquariums to go through. However, if there are further outbreaks of brown diatoms, there is something wrong with the water chemistry in the aquarium. In the past, we have had several tanks which, for a variety of reasons, have ""recycled"", generating elevated ammonia and nitrite for a number of days and shortly thereafter produced a brown diatom bloom which soon resolved. On the other hand, if the aquarium is not cycling normally and a substantial brown diatom algae bloom occurs, the problem is probably that there is an overabundance of food in the form of silicate and silicic acid on which the brown diatoms depend to grow.</p><p>So, how do the silicate and silicic acid get into your aquarium water? Many water sources (municipal, private, and even wells) contain silicate, silicic acid, or compounds that contain these elements. These compounds eventually break down, leaching silicate and silicic acid that end up in your aquarium. There are a number of silicate test kits available with which you can test your local water to see if it contains silicate.</p><p>Check the analysis on the sea salt mix you have been using. Some of these contain a certain amount of silicate, so you might want to consider changing sea salt mixes if you have a continuing problem with brown diatom outbreaks.</p><p>If your freshwater source contains levels of silicate, how do you remove them? Fortunately, there are a number of products that do this fairly efficiently. Before we go into which products will work at removing silicate, let's establish one that will not: activated carbon does not remove silicate, even the highest quality ones. In fact, a number of the lower quality carbon products actually leach phosphate (another brown diatom food) into your water, which is counterproductive.</p><p>Many phosphate-removing products also remove silicate from the water at the same time, giving you twice the bang for your buck. Some of these products come in sheet form, some of them in granulated form, and others are already loaded into pad form. Each of these products can be conformed in your filtration system to allow water to run through them, not ""over"" them. With a little imagination, you will be able to find a way to adapt them to even use them effectively in a hang-on filter.</p><p>You can also treat your source water to eliminate the silicate. A number of aquarists use RO/DI units to filter their source water. For those who are not familiar with RO/DO units, they are simply a series of chambers that you insert various cartridges into to remove specific compounds and elements from the water. Among the various cartridges available, there are some that will specifically remove silicate. They are not inexpensive but are, for the most part, able to efficiently remove silicate from a few hundred gallons of water before becoming exhausted and needing to be replaced.</p><p>In the end, as you can see, getting rid of and preventing brown diatom outbreaks is not that difficult to do. As with other algae, you just have to remove their food and starve them into oblivion. It's just a matter of identifying their food source.</p>",1286
78,https://www.thesprucepets.com/beware-of-poisonous-fish-2921455,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquarium Pests,<h1>Beware of Poisonous Fish in Saltwater Aquariums</h1>,"<h1>Beware of Poisonous Fish in Saltwater Aquariums</h1><p>Caution should be used when deciding if you want to keep a toxic saltwater fish. Some species not only have the ability to inflict a venomous sting that kills other animals, but many can cause toxic poisoning in an aquarium, which can result in the death of the other tank inhabitants, not to mention themselves. Fish such as these can also introduce a nasty poke or serious sting to humans as well!</p><p>A venomous sting that does not release toxins into the aquarium water will usually only affect the fish that was stung. This is often seen by a sudden and unexplainable loss of a fish when a stinging fish, such as a lionfish, is present. However, if all the fish in the tank are acting unusual, suddenly swimming erratically, or having the appearance of losing their sense of direction, there may be toxins in the water. The fish may show signs of heavy and rapid breathing, the eyes may cloud over, the fins become ragged, they lay on the bottom, and in the end, they will convulse and die. All of this can happen in a matter of minutes, depending on the toxicity of the poisonous fish or animal in the aquarium, and how large of an aquarium you have. Generally, the smaller the system, the faster the toxins can act.</p><p>If quick action is not taken, can be lost. If it's not too late, immediately remove any living fish and animals from the tank. Adding AmQuel to a contaminated aquarium helps to buffer and remove some of the effects of fish toxins. However, you still need to remove any remaining living animals from the aquarium until a complete and thorough tank/equipment cleaning and water change can be done. If the toxin from the poisonous fish is strong enough, sometimes it cannot be completely removed from the aquarium. If after having a toxic fish poisoning you have fish or other marine animals dying for no reason and everything else seems to check out, suspect residual toxins in the rocks, sand, gravel, carbon (if using for filtration), etc. This may warrant a complete strip-down and sterilization of the tank to rid yourself of the problem, but this is usually only in extreme cases.</p> <h2>Scorpionfishes (Family Scorpaenidae) </h2><p>Fish in the Family are mostly marine fish that include many of the world's most venomous species. As the name suggests, scorpionfish have a type of ""sting"" in the form of sharp spines coated with venomous mucus. Their dorsal, pelvic and anal spines are able to inject toxin made by glands along the spine. The effects of the toxins of fish in this family are two-fold. They can inflict venomous stings AND cause toxic tank poisoning, both of which can kill other tank inhabitants. As far as human interaction, stings are usually not fatal (unless you are allergic to the toxin), but are extremely painful and can sometimes persist for months after the event occurs. Immediate steps can be taken to lessen the effects of a Scorpionfish sting, but time seems to be the key to recovery.</p><p>Many species of Scorpionfish are bottom dwellers and are masters at the art of camouflage. The stonefish waits in disguise as a rock on the bottom for prey to pass them by before attacking, pouncing on the prey and rapidly opening its mouth to create a suction that pulls the prey into the mouth.</p><h2>Boxfishes (Family Ostraciidae) </h2><p>Ostraciidae is a family of squared, bony fish belonging to the order Tetraodontiformes, closely related to the pufferfishes and filefishes. Ostraciid boxfish of the genus also secrete poisons from their skin into the surrounding water, further protecting them from predation.</p><p>When startled, frightened or harassed, the fish in this family have the ability to release a fatal toxin from their bodies. They can kill every living thing in your aquarium, including themselves, leaving you with just your decorations, rocks and tank standing. Use extreme caution when mixing these fish in an aquarium, unless you want to take the risk of possibly losing everything. If you desire to keep them, they are best kept in a non-aggressive species tank. Cowfish and trunkfish are also part of the family and have this same characteristic trait.</p><h2>Pufferfishes (Family Tetraodontidae) </h2><p>The majority of pufferfish species are toxic and some are among the most poisonous vertebrates in the world. Also known as Balloon, Blow, Globe, and Toad fishes, these fish have the ability to store tetrodotoxin. In certain species, the internal organs, such as the liver, and sometimes their skin, contain tetrodotoxin and are highly toxic to most animals when eaten. Considered to be a delicacy by the Japanese, eating the meat of these fish, called Fugu, can result in severe food poisoning in humans, sometimes resulting in death, if not prepared properly.</p><p>Two of the most common types of puffers in Hawaii are the Green Whitepot/Stars & Stripes Puffer () and the Brown Whitespot/Speckled Puffer (). Some of these fish have the ability to exude their toxins into the water, too, so caution should be used when mixing these fish in your aquarium. We have had the experience of putting a Brown Whitespot Puffer in a catch bucket with a few other fish while collecting, and when we brought the fish up from diving to take them home, everything in the bucket was dead.</p><p>We were told, years ago when we started our fish business, that the Spider-Eye Puffer () is one of the most toxic puffers in the Tetraodontidae Family. Caution should be used when adding these fish to aquariums, as they can exude a toxin into the water, in addition to being poisonous if eaten.</p><h2>Squirrelfishes (Family )  </h2><p>The dorsal spines of Squirrelfishes have the capability to inflict a nasty poke that can result in something in comparison to a mild bee sting. Some species such as those from the Indo-Pacific region are known to be venomous while others are not. Wounds from this fish are not as serious as those of scorpionfishes but they can still be very painful once inflicted.</p><p>In closing, while some of these fish families do not have the capability to exude their toxins, some do have parts of their bodies that can be poisonous if consumed by other fish. If left in a tank after death, other fish may eat the flesh and become sick or possibly die.</p>",1086
79,https://www.thesprucepets.com/getting-rid-of-green-hair-algae-2924939,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquarium Pests,<h1>Green Hair Algae In Fish Tanks</h1>,"<h1>Green Hair Algae In Fish Tanks</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Both freshwater and saltwater aquariums can become infested by green hair algae. As the name suggests, this type of algae grows into long strings that resemble hair. Although mainly an aesthetic issue, long strings of this type of algae can actually entangle fish and invertebrates in your tank, making it difficult for them to move or feed. The algae grows fast, as well, and can become very unsightly. Removal of green hair algae is not an easy process, but prevention is key to keeping it from coming back. </p><h2>What Is Green Hair Algae? </h2><p>Algae are simple plant-like organisms belonging to the kingdom Protista. Like plants, algae can carry out photosynthesis, but lack the true roots, leaves, and stems typical of the more complex plants. There are many different species of green algae that can take on a hair-like appearance, but most green hair algae belongs to the genus This common scourge of the fish tank forms long strings, giving it a hairy appearance. It is also known as string algae.</p><p>While unsightly, green hair algae is not toxic to fish or invertebrates. However, thick mats can cause fish and invertebrates to become entangled, keeping them from eating. For some varieties of fish with fewer scales, such as Doitsu koi, hairy algae can cut into the fish's skin and cause secondary infections. Extensive growth of algae can reduce light levels and oxygen in your fish tank, as well, which is potentially harmful to your fish and to aquarium plants.</p><p>As with all plants, green hair algae utilizes the carbon dioxide in the aquarium water and produces oxygen through the process of photosynthesis when light is present. However, when the lights go off, algae will start to respire and use the oxygen in the water. If you do not have additional oxygen being added to your aquarium water via an aerator or filter, the algae may out-compete your fish for oxygen, causing them to asphyxiate and die. This will also cause respiratory acidosis and drop the pH of the aquarium water. If the pH or alkalinity is too low, that can also kill your fish.</p><h2>Symptoms of Green Hair Algae </h2><p>There are many different types of hair algae that can grow in a freshwater or saltwater aquarium. The signs are fairly obvious and usually start as a small patch of green algae that quickly forms into longer ""hairs.""</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>This type of algae forms by slowly linking up individual cells into longer chains, so you may see it get longer over time. If left alone, some species of hair algae can grow several inches long within days. The algae can grow on any structure within the aquarium, including the substrate at the tank's bottom, on the decorations and filter inside the tank, living or faux aquarium plants, and the inside of the tank glass.</p><h2>Causes of Green Hair Algae </h2><p>Unfortunately, no matter what kind of aquarium you have, fish + sunlight = algae. It only takes one cell of this simple plant to start growing a large population of stringy greenery. Even if you use a UV sterilizer on the water coming in with any new additions to your tank, you may have a cell or two of algae stuck to a fish, coral, or other invertebrate, which cannot be sterilized with UV light. Proper quarantine may help, but it is no guarantee.</p><p>Fish break down dietary protein to release ammonia in both saltwater and freshwater aquariums. Your biological filtration converts ammonia into nitrite and finally, nitrate. This nitrate is used as a nutrient by plants and algae. The more food for the algae, the more algae you can expect to have. The nitrate accumulates in the aquarium water unless it is removed by water changes. You can remove excess nitrate by performing more frequent water changes or increasing the volume of your water changes. It is highly recommended to use a gravel siphon weekly to remove excess food and debris from the substrate on the bottom of your tank.</p><p>In saltwater tanks, coral supplements such as phosphate can also provide fertilizer for algae. If you have a saltwater tank, but no corals, switch to a non-coral saltwater mix in order to keep your level of phosphate low. If you have corals and still have a problem with high phosphate, you may have to use a combination of coral and non-coral salt mixes to keep your corals happy and algae from growing out of control.</p><p>Lighting is another key component to algae growth. The more sunlight or artificial light on your tank, the more energy will be available for algae to grow and proliferate. Try to keep your aquarium out of the sunlight, as this will deter algae growth and keep a more consistent temperature. If your aquarium has artificial lighting, it is helpful to use an on/off timer on the light fixture to make sure you have the lights set for designated day (on) and night (off) periods. You may consider decreasing your day light periods and increasing your night periods to reduce algae growth, if that will not affect your tank inhabitants.</p><h2>Diagnosis </h2><p>You can diagnose green hair algae in your fish tank simply by its distinctive appearance. Look for stringy, hair-like green growth that rapidly covers most interior surfaces of the fish tank.</p><h2>Treatment of Green Hair Algae </h2><p>Chemical additives and UV light may work well on more complex forms of algae, but not hair algae. The best way to remove hair algae from your aquarium is manual removal, combined with steps to keep your aquarium water well-balanced with the proper levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen.</p><p>Use an algae scraper on the sides of your tank, making sure your equipment is specific to a glass or acrylic aquarium. For décor items, remove them from the tank during your regular cleanings, and scrub them with a soft brush, such as a designated toothbrush, under hot, chlorinated water.</p><p>For live plants, you can gently rub the algae off the leaves or perform a quick algaecide dip. For algae growing on substrate, the best method is to use a gravel siphon to turn the gravel away from the aquarium lighting. For algae growing on corals and invertebrate shells, you must be very gentle. Use a small airline suction device to carefully remove algae growth from these delicate creatures. Never scrub them, as this can cause injury.</p>",1077

Some aquarists feel that they make an interesting, intriguing, and enjoyable pet to have in an aquarium, while others feel they are the total scourge of any aquarium. Let's take a look at their characteristics and nature to learn more about them; then you can decide for yourself if you want to keep one or not.</p><h2>What Are Mantis Shrimp? </h2><p>Found in tropical waters worldwide, hey fit into the phylum in the class , subclass (which means ""armed shrimp""), and order . They are most often referred to as Stomatopods and come in what seems like an endless variety of species. Because they are carnivores and will eat just about anything and everything, they are experts at catching and killing prey, being very clever, stealthy hunters. They are solitary animals, and unless you have a very large tank, they should be kept alone.<br/></p><p>There are two hunting categories, the ""spearers"" and the ""smashers."" The "" spearers"" use their spear-like claw to silently stab soft-tissued prey. The ""smashers"" use their forceful, club-like claw to hit, crack open or pulverize harder bodied prey. It is interesting that the power of the ""smashers"" appendage can produce a blow close to the power of a .22-caliber bullet and are notoriously known as ""thumb splitters."" It is rumored that because of the tremendous strength a mantis shrimp can have, they can crack aquarium glass!</p><h3>Fun Fact</h3><p>Mantis shrimp are not related to shrimp but are referred to as shrimp because of their front appendages and how they use them to capture food. They are called a ""mantis"" shrimp due to the fact they resemble the appearance and have the same hunting characteristics of a praying mantis insect.</p><p>These animals are burrowers and can create tubes or cavities in sand, rubble or mud. They will adapt to living in holes, cracks or crevices in rocks, and may take up residence in snail or hermit crab shells as well. A mantis shrimp could even unexpectedly show up in your tank because it hid (too successfully) on a live rock they are masters at hiding!</p><p>The mantis shrimp is no wimp; some species can reach up to a length of about 12 inches. You can find a very large six- to eight-inch, black and white striped species while walking the mudflats in Hawaii that are not to be taken lightly.<br/></p><h2>Common Sign of a Mantis Shrimp </h2><p>When fish, crustaceans, and invertebrates begin to mysteriously disappear from your aquarium without a trace, the first assumption a lot of aquarists make is that a mantis shrimp is the culprit. Even though this is a prime sign that a mantis shrimp may be present in your tank, it sometimes can be a premature conclusion as well. There are other marine animals that can contribute to this same problem. Do consider a mantis shrimp as the culprit, especially if fish are disappearing, but also investigate other possibilities thoroughly before you start driving yourself nuts looking for one.</p><h2>Popping Noises: Mantis Shrimp vs. Pistol Shrimp </h2><p>Some say when you hear clicking, popping or snapping noises coming from your tank, you have a mantis shrimp. Others say this is not so, that you have a pistol shrimp and not a mantis shrimp.</p><p>Obviously, if you already have a pistol shrimp, you should suspect the sound is being made by a pistol shrimp. That not withstanding, pistol shrimp are unlikely candidates for attacking or killing fish. They will, however, punch holes in hermit crab, snail, and other mollusks shells to kill and eat the animals in them.<br/></p><p>Since these animals are natural burrowers, creating tubes or cavities in sand, rubble or mud, look for holes or tunnels in the substrate. These are usually accompanied by a mound of sand or substrate rubble piled up outside the hole. Pistol shrimp have this character trait as well, so if you find a hole like this, just dim the tank lights and sit back to see what comes out.</p><h2>Mantis Shrimp: Pest vs. Pet </h2><p>In the aquarium hobby, mantis shrimp are made out to be the worst, monstrous creatures that have ever inhabited oceans or aquariums. For those marine aquarists who have lost many valuable specimens to a mantis shrimp, you can see their point of view as to why they have this reputation.</p><p>However, if a mantis shrimp is accidentally introducing into your tank while adding some new live rock, what do you expect from a carnivorous creature like this? Is it the shrimp's fault it ended up in your tank and began to eat everything in it? Mantis shrimp may seem to be monsters, but they are just doing what they naturally do: hunt.</p><p>Some aquarists love mantis shrimp and enjoy their company. They are hardy and difficult to kill, aren't picky about tank water conditions or filtration, are easy to feed and cheap to maintain. This is not to say that if you have one you should neglect their tank environment, but just to make the point that they are easy to care for and are not very demanding like a lot of other marine animals can be. Whenever you decide to keep any marine animal, the responsibility to properly care for it is expected. You, as their caretaker, should respect that!</p><p>The question of whether intentionally adding a mantis shrimp to a fish-only or reef tank is bad, the answer to this is an unequivocal, yes!. If you do put one in an aquarium with other animals, don't get mad at the shrimp if things start disappearing. If you decide you want to buy a mantis shrimp or keep one, because of its territorial and aggressive nature, it is best kept it in a tank by itself, but several may be kept together if you have a very big tank with plenty of room.</p><h2>How to Remove Mantis Shrimp from an Aquarium </h2><p>When removing a mantis shrimp, it is not always an easy task. It takes patience and time. If one method doesn't work, try another.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Always wear a pair of heavy protective gloves when dealing with mantis shrimp.</p>",1053

Is it going to hurt anything?</p><p>Sound familiar? These and similar questions are not odd, but what odd is how many aquarists don't realize that when it comes to keeping a saltwater system, it's not unusual for strange things to show up. We don't understand why someone is so surprised when it happens because it's all part of a marine environment!</p><h2>Reasons Organisms Appear </h2><p>Although organisms are usually introduced into an aquarium by way of newly added live rock and live sand, there are other reasons why things appear out of what ""seems"" like nowhere.</p><h3>They Grew Larger </h3><p>Many organisms are microscopic or plankton-sized when they start out, so until they grow large enough to be seen with the naked eye, you don't know they are there.</p><p>Some organisms that can be seen with the naked eye, no matter how large or small, are experts at hiding. They hitchhike in on live rock and sand, and it is only after you have placed it into your aquarium that these organisms then crawl out and make themselves at home.</p><h3>They Are Hitchhikers </h3><p>Often corals, anemones, urchins, sea cucumbers, starfishes, nudibranchs and other forms of marine life play host to other, much smaller hitchhikers on the reef. Just a few examples of the many types of symbiotic relationships that occur in nature are the Pacific Clown Anemone Shrimp () and Anemone Crab () that live with various types of sea anemones. The Sea Cucumber Crab () lives commensally on the body, but most often among the tentacles or in the mouth, as well as the anus of several species of sea cucumbers.</p><h3>They Are Eggs </h3><p>Marine animals can have babies. As examples, some crabs and shrimps can hatch out live fry when mated pairs are present, snails reproduce by laying weird looking egg sacs, and corals spawn or split.</p><p>For these reasons, organisms that suddenly show up in an aquarium were most likely there all along or were spawned by other tank inhabitants. You just couldn't or didn't see them yet.</p><h2>Types of Organisms </h2><p>Here are just some of the strange things one might find showing up all the sudden in a saltwater aquarium.</p><h3>Algae </h3><h3>Arthropodas - Crustaceans </h3><h3>Cnidarians - Anthozoans - Hexacorallians </h3><p>The Order in this taxonomy line contains Suborders and Families of Sea Anemones, which includes the unwanted species.

The typical Hydroid is a polyp colony on a flexible featherlike or fernlike skeleton consisting of a main stem and numerous side branches.</p><h3>Bryozoans (or Ectoprocta) </h3><p>Tiny colonial animals.

One day you gaze at your aquarium and notice a small snail on the glass. It looks harmless enough. A week later, the snail has half a dozen companions. Before you know it, the tank is crawling with them.</p><p>Where did they come from? How did they multiply so rapidly? More importantly, what can you do to get rid of them? Anyone who has fought the snail battle knows it is a tough one, but there are things you can do to keep them at bay.</p><h2>Where Do They Come From? </h2><p>When you set up your aquarium there were no snails in it, so where did they come from? Snails usually arrive on plants in the tank, either as grown snails or as packets of eggs on the plant. Sometimes they arrive with the fish, having been scooped up when the fish was netted at the store and were added to the aquarium with the water in the transport bag. All it takes is one stray snail or a few eggs, and you have a resident snail population in your tank.</p><h2>How Do They Multiply? </h2><p>Perhaps the most astonishing thing about snails is how easily they multiply, especially when there was only one snail to start with. It only takes one snail, as most snails don't require a mate to reproduce. No need to find a snail matchmaking service, the lone snail fertilizes its own eggs, and voila, a couple of weeks later it becomes a single parent.</p><p>Furthermore, it is not unusual for some species of snails to spend their day buried in the substrate, coming out only at night to forage for a meal. That cute little snail you saw on the glass probably has dozens if not hundreds of siblings hanging out under the gravel. And you guessed it each one of them can have children all by itself. It's not surprising that your snail problem can mushroom out of control in no time at all.</p><h2>Controlling Snails </h2><p>Even though the snail has the advantage of reproducing quickly, and can easily hide, you can still win this battle. All you have to do is use your superior brain power. Snails can be lured out by simply clipping a lettuce leaf to the glass before you go to bed. In the morning there will be a whole family of snails feasting on the lettuce, which you will scoop out of the tank and dispose of. You won't eliminate every snail that way, but you can keep their numbers under control.</p><p>Another option is to put snail-eating fish in your tank. Any respectable Clown loach or Yo-Yo Loach would give their right fin for a snail dinner. They will sift through the gravel, sucking any snail they find right out of its shell. Loaches will even dive under the substrate in their snail hunting quest. Labyrinth fish, such as Bettas and Gouramis, will also eat snails. However, they are not as adept at tracking them down in the gravel.</p><p>There are commercial preparations, usually containing copper, to add to aquariums to reduce snails. Care must be taken to use it at the correct dose to not harm the fish.</p><p>Lastly, remember the equation, less food = fewer snails. Reduce the amount of food your fish are given, and there will not be as much leftover for the snails.</p><h2>Prevention </h2><p>The best way to avoid snail problems is to never let them in the tank in the first place. When you purchase a fish, make sure nothing that is in the bag (including the water) is dumped into the aquarium. If you purchase live plants, treat them before adding them to the tank.</p><p>Remember that having a few snails in your aquarium isn't necessarily a bad thing, as they eat algae and eliminate food that isn't eaten by the fish. As long as you keep them at bay, they can work in your favor.</p>",690

Their requirements were not very well understood, and corals used to be almost impossible to keep alive for any length of time in a marine aquarium. Over time and with many successful and failed experiments along the way, the knowledge, products, and information are now available, so that many corals can now be successfully kept in even mini, micro, and nano aquariums. Some are now considered ""easy"" to maintain while many other corals are still deemed difficult to nearly impossible for the average reef tank hobbyist.</p><h2>Mushroom Corals (Actinodiscus) </h2><p>The mushroom () corals are soft corals, have no exoskeleton, and grow on rocks. They do not grow well in bright lights or heavy currents. To allow for maximal expansion and reproduction, mushroom corals are best kept under lower lighting conditions (fluorescent lighting is ideal) with little water movement.</p><p>Safe with fish, crustaceans, and motile invertebrates, they should not be placed next to other soft and stony corals and sessile invertebrates because of the detrimental effect they can have on them.</p><h2>Leather Corals (Sinularia) </h2><p>Commonly known as leather corals, these are excellent saltwater aquarium starter corals, being adaptable to moderate light and current conditions. They prefer moderate turbulent water flow, but not a linear flow. Leather corals do not have a calcified skeleton. They do have the ability to sting other corals to keep them away. Provide plenty of space between your corals.</p><h2>Star, Green Star, and Daisy Polyps (Pachyclavularia) </h2><p>These good starter corals, commonly known as star polyps, green star polyps, and daisy polyps, are tolerant of both intense and low-level light as well as a range of currents. Being sensitive to iodine and aluminum oxide found in some phosphate removing filter sponges, caution should be taken when adding these filter materials to your tank.</p><p>This coral is very fast-spreading to the point where it can overgrow other corals. It is tolerant of both low- and high-level lighting as well as varied water currents. This coral should be blown clear of detritus occasionally to prevent slime and filamentous algae from gaining a foothold.</p><h2>Sea Mat and Button Polyps (Palythoa and Protopalythoa) </h2><p>Commonly known as sea mat and button polyps, these corals prefer bright light but are tolerant of lower light. Preferring moderate to strong current, have a high reproductive rate and are very aggressive. Some of these species contain a strong neurotoxin that can affect humans, called Palytoxin, which is a very dangerous substance that is toxic to all animals, other corals, fish, birds, cats, dogs, and people. For this reason, one should take care when handling them and wear gloves. Don't handle them if you have cuts or open wounds on your hands and make sure to clean your hands after handling them.</p><p>While most of these corals are brown to dark brown, a fair number of them contain elements in their tentacle tips that fluoresce beautifully under actinic blue lighting. They most often grow as solitary polyps or in small tightly clustered groups.</p><h2>Finger Leather Corals and Colt Corals (Cladiella) </h2><p>These are commonly known as finger leather and colt corals because they have projections resembling fingers that are round to cone-shaped, and stubby. These thick finger-like projections branch upward from a very short, pale white stalk. While adaptable to most light and current conditions, these beautiful corals are found at mid-water levels in the ocean, so moderate light and current levels are optimal for them in captivity.</p><h2>Toadstool Mushroom Coral (Sarcophyton) </h2><p>Corals in the genus  are commonly known as toadstool corals. The name comes from the fact that they look much like large toadstool mushrooms, and they're generally fast-growing and hardy corals. These are great beginner's corals that adapt well to most lighting levels as well as low to moderate current levels. These corals grow rapidly and are considered excellent for propagation. They can produce toxins that may affect stony corals and sea anemones.</p><h2>Zoanthids, Zoanthus Button Polyps (Zoanthus) </h2><p>Members of this genus are very colorful, being shades of green and brown typically, but sometimes fluorescent red, orange, pink, lavender, blue, yellow, or gray, and usually two-toned. They form colonies of densely crowded polyps attached in a common tissue at the base. While these corals prefer bright light, they are tolerant of lower light and prefer moderate to strong current, making them a good starter coral.</p><p>These aggressive corals have a high reproductive rate and can spread rapidly in an aquarium. Some species in this genus contain a strong neurotoxin (palytoxin), which can affect humans. Wear gloves when handling them.</p><h2>Closed and Dented Brain Corals (Symphyllia) </h2><p>Common names of these corals include closed brain coral, dented brain coral, meat coral, brain coral, and Pacific cactus coral. These corals are highly successful in captivity being very tolerant of different light and current conditions but preferring bright, indirect light and moderate to low currents. These corals are sensitive to the presence of some soft corals, such as and and are very reactive to food (zooplankton, phytoplankton, and algae) in the water, extending their tentacles when food is detected.</p><h2>Moon, Pineapple, and Brain Corals (Favia and Favites) </h2><p>Common names for these corals include moon coral, pineapple coral, brain coral, and closed brain coral. These corals prefer bright lights; however, they will tolerate much lower levels. Preferring a gentle current, some will attach to a substrate if not moved for several months. can be fed and seem to appreciate a squirt or two of brine shrimp at night.</p><p>Care should be taken with the placement of these corals as they can send out transparent sweeper tentacles at night to deter other corals from growing near them. They are considered by many to be easier coral to keep.</p><h2>Honeycomb, Star, Wreath, and Moon Corals (Goniastrea) </h2><p>Common names for these corals include honeycomb coral, star coral, wreath coral, moon coral, pineapple coral, brain coral, and closed brain xoral. Considered a good coral for novices, these corals thrive under strong water current and bright lighting. They are usually rounded or lobed, similar in appearance to the corals. The tentacles are small and usually retracted during the day.</p><p>In the photo here, note the sweepers protruding from the coral. These are poisonous and are used for both defense and offense.</p><h2>Fox, Jasmine, and Ridge Corals (Nemenzophyllia) </h2><p>Common names for these corals include fox coral, jasmine coral, and ridge corals. These corals prefer a gentle current, calcifying and expanding best in dim to moderate light. Specimens in this genus do not produce feeding tentacles and therefore receive their nutrition from absorption. They have a very delicate skeleton structure that is easily broken.</p><p>It does best without heavy skimming or highly efficient water filtration, and it's considered an easy coral to keep.</p><h2>Lobed Brain Coral (Lobophyllia) </h2><p>Common names for these corals include lobed brain coral, flat brain coral, open brain coral, meat coral, modern coral, and large flower coral. These stony corals do best with bright direct light and calm currents; however, if adequate light and minimal water movement are provided, it will grow well in a tank.</p><p>This coral normally feeds actively at night; however, the tentacles occasionally extend during the day and readily take food offerings, feeding almost exclusively on zooplankton and bacterioplankton, which consists of free-living bacteria, detritus, particulate organic matter (POM), and suspended organic matter (SOM).</p><p>is not normally aggressive; however, there have been reports of sweeper tentacles being formed when they come in contact with other corals.</p>",1223

Fortunately, there will probably be a number of different tank sizes and styles that will work for you.</p><p>While you are shopping for your new tank, keep an eye on what equipment (filtration, lighting, etc.) is included. Buying an aquarium package or ""kit"" can save you a lot of time and money as everything included is designed to fit the tank. For smaller spaces, the Plug n' Play Mini/Nano Aquarium Kits are a quick way to get almost everything you will need to get started. For larger spaces, a 1-50 gallon aquarium might work for you. If you have the space and desire, one of the Showsize Display Aquariums might be just the ticket.</p><p>For those who want to design your own tank and save money at the same time, you might want to explore the DIY Aquariums route. Building your own aquarium is remarkably easy to do.</p><p>While you are shopping for your new aquarium, keep in mind that you will need something to put it on/in. Many of the packages include an aquarium stand, if not, there are a number of manufactured Aquarium Stands and Cabinets to choose from.</p><h2>Aquarium Lighting </h2><p>The type of lighting you choose will be based on the type of system you have planned to set up, as well as what kind of livestock you will be keeping in it. If you are not purchasing an aquarium kit or package you will have to select your tank lighting.</p><p>Fish-Only Tank Lighting is less expensive while Reef Tank Lighting and Coral Lighting are a bit more involved and pricey. While shopping for lighting, keep in mind that you may want to upgrade your tank from a Fish Only to a reef tank in the future. Buying fixtures which can be retrofitted with more powerful bulbs in the future might be a better buy in the long run.</p><p>If you are interested in a long (and even short) term money saver, look into the LED Light Fixtures. These sleek, compact and efficient fixtures are now available with reef grade bulbs. You will also find that using a Power Center to control your lights and other electrical equipment will greatly simplify running your new aquarium.</p><h2>Protein Skimmers, Filters & Filtration Equipment </h2><p>Filters & Filtration Equipment<br/></p><p>If you have not purchased an aquarium kit (package), the type of system you are going to set up will help you determine which kind of filters and filtration system to choose.</p><p>Protein Skimmer<br/></p><p>Protein skimmers remove Dissolved Organic Compounds (DOC's) directly from the aquarium system water, before they are processed by the biological filter. While not essential to an aquarium filtration system, many people find that skimmers do take a lot of the load from the biological filter, allowing a larger fish and invertebrate population in the tank. What protein skimming is, and how it works will help you understand their function.</p><h2>Powerheads </h2><p>Depending on the size of your aquarium, the use one or several powerheads is an excellent way to provide good water circulation throughout the system.<br/></p><h2>Substrate & Live Rock </h2><p>Substrate</p><p>Since the substrate is more than just the ""stuff at the bottom of the tank"", Choosing the right substrate for your aquarium is important. There are a number of different colors, types, densities and sizes of materials used for aquarium substrates. If you will be having a lot of water current in your tank, you will want a heavier substrate to keep it in place. If your substrate will be a significant part of the biological filter, porosity and surface area will be important.</p><p>If you choose to use a Jaubert/Plenum Filter, you will want to use a Live Sand that is suitable for a Deep Sand Bed.</p><p>Live Rock</p><p>Live Rock plays an important role in a marine tank. Many marine animals, fish in particular, can be quite territorial. It is important to provide ample shelter or places where the animals can hide, sleep, and avoid potential problems with aggression from other tankmates in the confined space of an aquarium.</p><h2>Sea Salt Mix/Saltwater & Hydrometer </h2><p>Sea Salt Mix/Saltwater & Hydrometer</p><p>Sea salts are what make an aquarium a saltwater or marine aquarium.

Some saltwater fish, such as mandarinfish and seahorses, prefer amphipods and copepods and may refuse to eat anything else. Amphipods are also a favorite food of sandsifting and sleeper gobies as well as freshwater beta fish. Culturing your own crustaceans for fish food in either a saltwater or freshwater tank is easier than it sounds and can be fun for dedicated DIY aquarists.</p><h2>What Are Amphipods and Copepods? </h2><p>Amphipods and copepods are microscopic crustaceans that form an essential link in the marine food chain. They graze on phytoplankton, rotifers (microscopic aquatic animals), and in some cases, detritus. They incorporate the protein and fatty acids from their food sources and concentrate them into a highly nutritious package for consumption by multiple marine animals.</p><p>Copepods naturally live in both saltwater and freshwater, making them a great choice for either type of aquarium system. Amphipods are primarily found in marine (saltwater) ecosystems, but there are freshwater species, too. Freshwater amphipods, commonly known as ""scuds,"" belong to the and genera.</p><p>Culturing procedures are the same for both freshwater and saltwater micro-crustaceans, but make sure to purchase amphipods that are suited to freshwater environments, such as or any of the species, if you have a freshwater tank.</p><h2>Before You Begin </h2><p>Make sure you are prepared for a constant cycle of feeding, maintaining, and harvesting your crustaceans. While the physical requirements aren't extensive, you must manage details like filtration, light, and salinity on an ongoing basis.</p><h2>Supplies </h2> <h2>Filtration </h2><h2>Grazing Surfaces </h2><p>Amphipods and copepods are both pelagic (free-swimming), and benthic (bottom-dwelling) creatures, but are primarily bottom dwellers. Amphipods have more of a tendency to rise from the bottom of the aquarium and enter the water column at night. (If there are large quantities of amphipods in a tank, they can easily be seen with a flashlight a few hours after dark.)</p><p>These tiny crustaceans do best in an aquarium containing large surface areas to graze on, such as old bio balls, live rock, old filter pads, coarse sand, or crushed coral substrates.<br/></p><h2>Lighting </h2><p>Neither amphipods nor copepods need a lot of light to grow or reproduce. Around 12 to 16 hours per day of minimal light (ambient daylight, small wattage incandescent, or LEDs) is sufficient. A clamp-on LED is perfect.</p><p>If you are using macroalgae as a growth medium, though, you will want to supply the right amount of light for algae growth.</p><h2>Salinity </h2><p>It's essential to maintain the salinity of your culturing system at the aquarium level in which you will be depositing the amphipods and copepods.</p><p>Using an in-line refugium with your main tank, you won't have to worry about it because the tank water cycles through the rearing system.</p><h2>Temperature </h2><p>Maintain a stable temperature between 72 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit. Amphipods and copepods are cold-blooded, so the warmer the water, the more active (feeding and reproducing) they are. Just don't ""cook"" them. Temperatures above 85 degrees Fahrenheit can be harmful.</p><h2>Feeding </h2><p>Amphipods aren't necessarily predatory, but they do prefer meaty foods. They are omnivores that tilt toward the role of carnivore much more than of herbivore. Feed meaty foods that break down fairly quickly in the water column. A good mixture of marine pellet and marine flake fish foods ground up in a mortar and pestle will yield terrific results.</p><p>You can also culture phytoplankton in a 2-liter plastic bottle to feed your copepods. There are several complete phytoplankton culturing kits available online.</p><p>Don't overfeed your crustaceans. They will consume what they need and no more. Putting more food in the tank will not make them eat more. Test the ammonia in the tank to see if you are feeding too much. If your ammonia readings start to spike, perform a water change to lower the level and cut back on the food.</p><p>It may take a bit of experimenting, but you should be able to find the right amount of food to periodically introduce to the culturing tank.</p><h2>Maintain the Tank </h2><p>An in-line refugium requires little maintenance, but a stand-alone system will need a water change once per month (or after harvest). If you're overfeeding, then you may need additional water changes until you determine the appropriate amount of food to maintain your crustaceans without excess.</p><h2>Harvesting </h2><p>Harvesting can usually be done by siphoning the tiny crustaceans into a fine mesh fishnet.</p><p>If you are using old filter pads for a growth medium, just remove them from the growth tank and place them in a bucket of tank water, then pour the water through a net.</p><p>If you are using a crushed coral substrate, siphon the substrate the same as you would gravel vacuum your tank bottom, using a fine mesh on the water outflow to catch the copepods and amphipods.</p><h2>Feeding Your Fish </h2><p>The amphipods and copepods that you collect in the fishnet can be fed to your fish by putting the net in the water and swishing the tiny organisms. The fish should immediately respond and swim toward the net to consume them.</p><p>Copepods and amphipods are often naturally introduced into closed aquarium systems when live sand and/or live rock have been added. They will begin to multiply and grow in the tank when the aquarium water temperature is slightly warmer and a food source is available.</p><p>Once you have your crustacean culturing system set up and running and have worked the wrinkles out of feeding, maintenance, and harvesting, you will find that the system is an easy, low-cost method to provide a high nutrition food to your hard-to-please marine fish.</p><h2>Troubleshooting </h2><p>If you find that your cultivation is not going as planned, don't worry. It can be hard to determine the exact cause. It may make the most sense (and save time and energy), to simply start again rather than tweak the cultivation setup you have.</p><p>Another option is to work with a local fish store or another expert who may be able to help examine your setup and provide suggestions or problem-solving techniques.</p>",1042
86,https://www.thesprucepets.com/caring-for-duncan-coral-5071084,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquariums & Habitat,<h1>How to Care for a Duncan Coral</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Duncan Coral</h1><p>Duncan coral (), also known as branched disc coral, whisker coral or duncanops coral, can be an appealing addition to many reef saltwater aquariums. Originating from Australia, Duncan coral is a community player and a vibrant green and purple addition to any saltwater tank. This species has done well in aquaculture conditions and is readily propagated.</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Duncan corals are characterized by their disc-shaped body, and short purple/green tentacles that can quickly retract into their calciferous tube home. Members of the family Dendrophyllidae, they are related to other stony corals such as spp. and spp. They can be classified as a large-polyp stony coral (LPS) and are common in aquacultured assortments. Since they reside in a stony tube, it is critical to carefully move the entire animal in order to prevent fragmenting their home and/or body. As they get larger, you may see new polyps or heads extending from the sides of the tubes.</p><h2>Habitat Requirements </h2><p>These peaceful corals get along well with many other corals and other invertebrates. They do not have any natural defenses that may harm fish, so their tube homes may be nibbled on by aggressive tank mates. Be careful about which fish you add to aquariums with stony corals! Even if fed properly, the fish may not be able to keep themselves from giving your corals a nibble. This is safe for the fish, but may decimate your coral colonies. When in doubt, only keep ""reef safe"" fish in coral tanks.</p><p>Due to their delicate nature, Duncan corals prefer areas of low to moderate water movement. This may be an area in the middle to lower part of your tank, away from outcroppings and peaks with higher water flow, better suited to sturdier corals. With proper care, Duncan corals can easily spread throughout your aquarium, therefore are not well suited to nano tanks, but most larger tanks can accommodate their spread.</p><h2>How to Care for Your Duncan Coral </h2><p>Like other corals, Duncan coral contains zooxanthellae symbiotic algae within their tissues that provide most of their food source. In order to function properly, their algae needs adequate lighting. In the coral light spectrum, Duncan corals require low to moderate full spectrum lighting. As with other coral reef tanks, be sure to adapt your light to normal cycles of light and dark. Some specialized lights can even do a slow fade between cycles to mimic ""sunrise"" and ""sunset"" or even ""moonrise"" and ""moonset!"" These cycles are critical if you are looking to breed fish or invertebrates.</p><p>In addition to their photosynthesizing tenants, Duncan corals can benefit from an occasional feeding of small zooplankton. Frozen variety mixes in addition to more meaty foods, such as mysis, aren't a daily requirement, but a few weekly meals will boost your coral's appearance and growth.</p><p>Like other stony corals, Duncan corals have trace element requirements in order to keep sturdy homes. Depending on your salt mix, you may need to add in calcium, strontium and other trace elements. Be sure to test these levels regularly, in addition to your other water chemistry tests, to make sure the levels are within range.</p><h2>Troubleshooting </h2><p>As with all live aquatic species, corals can carry bacteria and viruses. Before adding any new corals to an established aquarium, be sure to quarantine them in a separate system, using separate equipment, for a minimum of four weeks. Buy your corals from reputable dealers who use safe propagation techniques and do not take from wild stocks. This will ensure your tank will stay healthy and safe from infection!</p><h3>Failure to Thrive </h3><p>Provided that you bought from a good source and quarantined your coral appropriately, the first thing to consider with a coral failing to thrive is water quality. This includes your usual water parameters (ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, pH, kH, gH, temperature and salinity), coral specific parameters (calcium, strontium and other trace elements), and sunlight. Yes, how much sunlight or artificial broad-spectrum lighting your coral gets directly affects its symbiotic zooxanthellae. Duncan corals are on the low to moderate spectrum for coral lighting, so you may have to adjust up or down, depending on your setup.</p><p>If all your water quality parameters are within normal range, make sure your coral is in an area of low to moderate water flow and not being harassed by any of their tank mates, fish and other corals alike. Remember, some corals do not play nice with close neighbors and will send a chemical attack their way. Nibbly fish may want to nip at corals no matter how much other food you offer.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If your coral is still failing to thrive, contact your local aquatic veterinarian.</p><h3>Movement </h3><p>If your coral doesn't like where they are placed in your tank, they may decide to make a change themselves! Within their tubular homes, you may see additional tubes forming away from the main body. Take the hint your coral is telling you and be sure to keep them in a more suitable environment. Don't force a coral into an area that doesn't suit them just because it fits your aesthetic!</p><h3>Algae Growing on Polyps </h3><p>Many times, this is a problem with too much food for the algae. Test your nitrate and phosphate levels to make sure they are within the correct ranges. Most of the time, this will require a few extra water changes to bring your levels down. Using a small suction device made out of rigid and flexible airline tubing will allow you to carefully clean the algae off of your corals. If you leave the algae on the corals, the zooxanthellae contained within the polyps will not have access to light and your coral will die.</p><p>Even if you are using a reef-specific salt mix, your phosphate may still be out of range. It depends on the types of corals you have in your aquarium and how many supplements they require. Soft corals have fewer requirements than hard or stony corals. If you cannot get your phosphate level down, consider trying a different salt mix or adding more stony corals into the aquarium to absorb the phosphate. There are filter media that can be used that absorb phosphate and will lower the level in the water, reducing unwanted algae growth.</p>",1032

Whenever a new product hits the market, they are normally relatively expensive (someone has to pay for the R&D). Prices come down when the product develops a demand and competition kicks in as more companies begin to offer the new product. To begin with, the LED lights were offered only as lunar lights added to existing fixtures to be used only at night. As their popularity increased, and their cost came down manufacturers began to offer fixtures in a wide variety of sizes and shapes.</p><p>The first LEDs weren't anywhere near what a saltwater reef tank would require as far as lumens, Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) and/or Color Rendering Index (CRI). LED development has grown at a remarkable rate in the past few years, both in colors available and light intensity. There are now 8000K Daylight and Actinic LEDs being used in aquarium lighting. There will be 14000K LEDs available soon.

Junction (depletion region) is marked above the N section. Electrons flow through a wire connecting the P section to the positive terminal of a battery, and through another wire connecting the battery's negative terminal to the N section.</p><p>LEDs differ from traditional light sources in the way they produce light. In an incandescent lamp, a tungsten filament is heated by electric current until it glows or emits light. In a fluorescent lamp, an electric arc excites mercury atoms, which emit ultraviolet (UV) radiation. After striking the phosphor coating on the inside of glass tubes, the UV radiation is converted and emitted as visible light.</p><p>An LED, in contrast, is a semiconductor diode. It consists of a chip of semiconducting material treated to create a structure called a p-n (positive-negative) junction. When connected to a power source, current flows from the p-side or anode to the n-side, or cathode, but not in the reverse direction. Charge-carriers (electrons and electron holes) flow into the junction from electrodes. When an electron meets a hole, it falls into a lower energy level and releases energy in the form of a photon (light).</p><p>The specific wavelength or color emitted by the LED depends on the materials used to make the diode.</p><p>Red LEDs are based on aluminum gallium arsenide (AlGaAs). Blue LEDs are made from indium gallium nitride (InGaN) and green from aluminum gallium phosphide (AlGaP). ""White"" light is created by combining the light from red, green, and blue (RGB) LEDs or by coating a blue LED with yellow phosphor.</p><p>*Description of How LEDs Work courtesy of the U.S. Dept. of Energy. Compare prices on saltwater aquarium LED lights.</p><h2>Typical Luminous Efficacy and Color Characteristics of Current White LEDs </h2><p>How do currently available white LEDs compare to traditional light sources in terms of color characteristics and luminous efficacy? Standard incandescent A-lamps provide about 15 lumens per watt (lm/W), with Correlated Color Temperature (CCT) of around 2700 K and Color Rendering Index (CRI) close to 100. ENERGY STAR-qualified compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) produce about 50 lm/W at 2700-3000 K with a CRI of at least 80. Typical efficacies of currently available LED devices from the leading manufacturers are shown above. Improvements are announced by the industry regularly. Please note the efficacies listed below do not include driver or thermal losses.</p><p>* The chart above is a bit out of date now, as LEDs in the 8000K and above range are now available.</p><p>* Sources: Manufacturer data sheets including Cree XLamp XR-E, Philips Lumileds Rebel, Philips Lumileds K2.

To be sure, the low wattage and long life of the LED bulbs (some manufacturers claim up to 50,000 hours) are definite selling points. LED users have also raved about the low amount of heat produced, which helps to keep tank water temperatures down as well as the ""shimmering"" effect produced by the LEDs.</p><p>What are the disadvantages? One possibility might be the purchase price, but if you factor in the long life of the bulbs and the low amount of electricity required to drive the lights, you might even be saving money over the long haul. The light intensity may be another drawback for a reef tank with hard corals.</p><p>An comparative example would be the 24"" Marineland Pro Lighting 24-Hour Lighting System with a total of 246 watts (1 150W 14,000K HQI lamp, 4 24 Watt T-5 lamps) and 2 1 watt lunar LEDs. Compare Prices for about $560 and the 23"" ecoxotic Panorama LED with 54 White 8,000 K LEDs and 18 Actinic Blue 460nm LEDs with a total of 73 watts Compare Prices for about $760.</p><p>The LEDs last up to 50,000 hours) (11 years at 12 hours lighting/day), while the HQI's and T-5s last about 1 year. The replacement cost for the HQI replacement bulbs is about $60 and the replacement cost for the T-5's is about $16 each ($64 /yr). Even if you don't take into consideration the cost of the power savings, the LED package is just about break even with the HQI & T-5 fixture over three years.</p><p>Many LED light users have noted an almost immediate reduction in nuisance algae growth in their tanks.</p><h2>The Future for LEDs </h2><p>Presently, there aren't too many LED bulbs that are designed specifically for reef tank use. What normally happens is: a bulb with specific properties (CRI, CCT) is developed for another use, than are adopted for aquarium use. At the time of this writing, there are LED bulbs in the 8000K range which are being used for reef tank lighting. There is no doubt that higher-powered bulbs will be developed in the near future which will work even better for aquariums. Compare prices on saltwater aquarium LED lights.</p>",1021

Sometimes, your coralline algae may start to turn white and lose its pink hue. Why does this happen and how can you protect your coralline algae from turning white?</p><h3>Coraline Algae</h3><p>Coralline algae is a group of red algae (Rhodophyta) that contain calcium carbonate in their cell walls. This gives them their crusty texture and are frequently red or pink in coloration. They are a common algae found in coral reefs, contributing to the aquatic ecosystem.</p><h2>Where Coralline Algae Is Found </h2><p>There may be as many as 10,000 species of red algae found in oceans all around the world. Coralline algae usually enters your tank on live rock or coral plugs. Once established, it can climb all over your aquarium, often on the live rock and other hard, immobile surfaces in addition to the sides of your tank and equipment. If left to its own devices, it can gunk up various mechanical components, including powerheads and mechanical filtration.</p><h2>What Causes Coralline Algae to Turn White </h2><p>Due to its calcium carbonate structure, when the algae dies, it leaves behind its white exoskeleton. This is very similar to hard corals that lose their zooxanthellae during the bleaching process. Although these species are found in different groups and have distinctive structures, when their internal algal cells depart, they leave behind the crunchy, white outer coating.</p><p>There are many environmental conditions that can cause coralline algae to abandon their homes. Again, these causes can be very similar to influences that will cause your hard corals to also bleach. Among the most common causes are shifts in pH, temperature, and light.</p><h2>pH Level in Your Saltwater Aquarium </h2><p>The pH of your saltwater tank needs to be much more precise than your freshwater tank. Most marine species fish and invertebrates included have a very narrow optimum pH range. If the pH strays too far acidic or alkaline, you could lose all your aquarium inhabitants. In order to keep your pH stable, you will need to monitor your tank's kH (carbonate hardness), or alkalinity. The alkalinity buffers the pH, preventing rapid shifts, and is made up of the carbonates in the water. These are the same carbonates that your coralline algae will use to build their homes. Your tank's alkalinity is not an infinite supply, but it can be regularly augmented through water changes or the breakdown of other carbonate containing tank materials, such as sea shells.</p><p>When mixing the salt water for your aquarium, it is critical that you choose the correct salt mix, depending on if you have corals or just fish. These mixes will be vastly different in the buffering components they contain.</p><h2>Temperature of Your Saltwater Aquarium</h2><p>Another critical parameter for saltwater aquariums is temperature. In order to maintain the correct environmental temperature, you will need reliable heaters and good water movement. Don't forget that even if your heater is properly working, you still need consistent water flow around your tank to avoid any cold spots. Coralline algae stuck in a cold spot will often turn white due to poor environmental conditions.</p><p>Don't rely on your aquarium thermometer on its own, especially in nano systems. In addition to a backup heater, be sure to have a reliable digital thermometer to double check that your heater is working properly. In nano tanks, small heaters are notorious for not holding a consistent temperature and bouncing around an ""acceptable"" range. If your heater is unable to maintain consistent temperature throughout the day, you may need to add other insulating components or put your tank in another area.</p><h2>Light in Your Saltwater Aquarium </h2><p>Light is thought to be the most critical component when it comes to making your algae and corals healthy. Not all algae and corals will like the same type of light spectrum, intensity, and length of time. The photoperiod of your tank, or the amount of light your tank is exposed to, is sometimes a difficult element to manipulate. Depending on where your tank's species are found in the world, they may have varying requirements for light, which can also change seasonally. If you are having bleaching problems, research the correct lighting for your species and adjust your lights to provide the correct timing and intensity.<br/></p><h2>How You Can Fix Coralline Algae That Turns White </h2><p>Once your coralline algae turns white, there is no getting it back. But once you notice a part has started to turn white, it is time to start looking at your water quality parameters. If your pH and temperature are consistent throughout the day, it's time to start backing off your lights. It may take multiple rounds of experimentation to make your coralline algae healthy. Keep in mind that by messing around with some light settings, you may upset corals in your tank. It can be a difficult balance to keep everything happy at once if they come from various parts of the world.</p><h2>How You Can Prevent Coralline Algae From Turning White </h2><p>It can be difficult to prevent coralline algae from turning white, but you can try to stop it before it takes over your entire tank population. The best preventive measure is regular water quality testing using a liquid-based test kit opened within the last year. Be sure to read all testing instructions thoroughly and write down your results in order to catch any trends. Test at various times throughout the day since your pH and temperature will change based on the photoperiod you have selected for your aquarium.</p>",947
89,https://www.thesprucepets.com/faq-red-slime-algae-2924578,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquariums & Habitat,<h1>How to Remove Red Slime Algae in a Saltwater Aquarium</h1>,"<h1>How to Remove Red Slime Algae in a Saltwater Aquarium</h1><p>Saltwater aquariums can be challenging in many aspects, but the appearance of ""red slime"" causes a chill down the spine of all marine aquarists. Coating substrate, live rock and even sessile invertebrates if left to flourish, red slime can feel like an uphill battle.</p><h2>What Is ""Red Slime?"" </h2><p>Not to be confused with red algae, ""red slime"" is technically cyanobacteria that contains a red pigment. Cyanobacteria is typically classified as ""blue-green algae,"" but can come in various colors. These primitive algaes are thought to be early plants that first started surviving by photosynthesis, creating the oxygen-rich atmosphere we enjoy today.</p><h2>How Does Red Slime Affect My Qquarium? </h2><p>Like most unwanted algaes, red slime is mostly an eyesore. Depending on your tank conditions, red slime can flourish and blanket your tank rapidly. Sessile invertebrates, such as corals and clams, may get overtaken if the algae is not controlled.</p><p>Like other live plants and algae in aquariums, red slime is happy when the lights are on and create lots of oxygen through photosynthesis. However, when the lights go off, algae will use oxygen dissolved in the water to survive. If there is not enough oxygen to go around, your fish could be at risk for asphyxiation. If your kH, or alkalinity, isn't high enough, you may have a pH dip during the night as more carbon dioxide is produced and not being used for photosynthesis. Check your oxygen levels and kH levels at their lowest, right before the lights come on or the sun comes up, to make sure your levels are adequate.</p><h2>How Do I Get Rid of Red Slime? </h2><p>Like many other aquarium nuisances, red slime takes advantage of poor water quality environments and proliferates quickly. All it takes is tiny cell to create a forest of red slime.</p><p>Phosphate, nitrate, and other dissolved organic compounds are the most common cause of red slime. Phosphates naturally occur in some water sources and are vital to building of hard coral homes. If you do not have corals in your tank and you are using a coral-specific saltwater mix, you can easily drop your phosphate levels by switching to a non-coral mix. Phosphates do not affect your fish's health.</p><p>Nitrate is the end stage of your nitrogen cycle. Although safe in lower concentrations, high nitrate levels can cause severe disease in fish, let alone cause an increase in algae growth. Nitrates are usually removed from your system by performing water changes. Getting behind on maintenance is the number one cause of red slime.</p><p>Like all photosynthesizing life, cyanobacteria relies on a light source to grow. Red slime, in particular, likes 560 to 620 nm spectrum. By reducing your light levels, but not so drastically as to hurt your other photosynthesizers, like the zooxanthellae in corals, you can reduce your red slime load.</p><p>Although less likely, hypersalinity can also cause an increase in algae growth. Hypersalinity usually happens when you top off your evaporation with saltwater. Although it may feel completely against your reasoning, saltwater systems need to be topped off with fresh water. When evaporation occurs, the salt molecules remain behind, causing increased salinity. Topping off with freshwater sets this back to the correct salinity. Test your water salinity multiple times a week with a simple refractometer.</p><p>Some antibiotics may be effective, but they are not controlled and will wipe out biological filtration. They will certainly only act as a bandaid and your algae will return if you have other predisposing factors that are not addressed.</p><p>Once you have figured out what parameters have promoted red slime growth, you can siphon out as much as possible. Using a tiny rigid airline suction hose will get into the tight spaces and crevices. Remember, it only takes one cell to grow a blanket!</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Ensure that you safely dispose of any collected cyanobacteria. This substance, depending on its species and composition, can be toxic to other animals, namely dogs. Do pile it up in the backyard where your kids or dog can access it.</p><h2>How Do I Prevent Red Slime? </h2><p>The best way to prevent red slime is to keep up with your regular saltwater aquarium maintenance regimen. A few missed water changes can give red slime a chance to take hold and overrun your system.</p><p>Use a saltwater mix that is best for your system. If you do not have hard corals, you may not need a coral-specific mix. This will decrease the phosphate load in your tank easily.</p><p>Make sure your lighting is appropriate for your tank. This will depend on your other photosynthesizers, mainly corals. Don't dump antibiotics into your tank. The fix won't last and you'll be looking at starting your nitrogen cycle from scratch. Once you master the predisposing factors that breed red slime, you will be rid of it for good.</p>",799

Coral </h2><p>How can you tell if your mushroom corals are receiving the right amount of light? Mushrooms that are exposed to too much light will tend to curl up. Mushrooms that are receiving too little light will extend, reaching for the light source and also lose some of their bright colors. Mushrooms that are getting the right amount of light will lay flat on the rock or substrate.</p><h2>Mushroom (Actinodiscus sp.) Corals </h2><p>Mushroom corals obtain much of their required nutrition from their surroundings as well as from light (the sun in the ocean).</p><h2>Mushroom (Actinodiscus sp.) Coral </h2><p>Using a highly developed mucus capture and transport system, these corals derive nutrients by collecting and ingesting particulate matter suspended in the water around them and from their zooxanthellae.</p><h2>Blue Green Pimple Mushroom Anemones </h2><p>With the right conditions, most mushroom corals are quite prolific in an aquarium, producing many offspring several times per year if they receive even less than perfect lighting and nutritional levels.</p><h2>Fluorescent Green Mushroom Corals </h2> <h2>Giant Elephant Ear Mushroom Coral </h2><p>The elephant ear mushroom coral is usually brown or green with a large wavy surface, a leathery texture, and multiple mouths. It can reach 10 inches or more in diameter.</p><h2>Striped Mushroom Corals (Actinodisc sp.) </h2><p>These corals display a wide variety of colors, textures, and patterns. Some are solid colors, whereas, others are striped or spotted. Striped varieties are usually green.</p><h2>Ricordea floridea Mushroom Corals </h2><p>This type of mushroom coral is highly prized by the avid collector and makes a vibrant addition to the reef aquarium.</p><h2>Hairy Mushroom Anemones (Rhodactis sp.) </h2><p>The hairy mushroom occurs in many colors including brown and tan and the more colorful green. Just like the name suggests, the surface of these mushrooms is covered with many hair-like tentacles, giving it a hairy appearance.</p><h2>Flower Anemone (Actina equina) </h2><p>The Ricordea or flower mushroom coral has short, club, or berry-shaped tentacles. It shares some similarities to stony corals and is also termed a disc anemone. It is found in a variety of color forms, but green is the most common.</p><h2>Spotted Red Mushroom Coral (Discosoma sp.) </h2><p>The spotted mushroom () corals display a wide variety of colors, textures, and patterns. Some are solid colors, whereas, others are striped or spotted. The spotted ones are usually blue or green with spots.</p><h2>Stony Disk or Mushroom Coral </h2><p>This is a stony disk or mushroom coral (). Other common names for this coral include plate, tongue, fungus, chinaman hat, dome, helmet, mole, Neptune's cap, plate, long tentacled plate, and slipper coral.</p><h2>Ricordea Coral </h2><p> Ricordea corals are highly prized in the saltwater aquarium hobby.</p>",730
91,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-changes-in-lighting-effects-corals-2925020,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Aquariums & Habitat,<h1>Coral Lighting - How Changes In Lighting Effects Corals</h1>,"<h1>Coral Lighting - How Changes In Lighting Effects Corals</h1><h2>How Corals Grow</h2><p>We have mentioned SPS corals and the necessity for proper CRI and intensity in the past. First and foremost, most corals can be placed into three major categories: Stony (exterior skeletons), Soft (no calcium-based skeleton), and SPS (Short/Small Polyp Stony). Naturally, the scientific world can categorize these animals down to the ""nth"" degree, but for our purposes, these three categories will suffice. </p><p>When it comes to how corals grow, each category of animal requires its own unique lighting requirements, but all share one common trait; photosynthesis in order to survive. Just as plants convert sunlight to produce chlorophyll, marine animals survive similarly by converting light energy into ""food"". Actually, this energy is consumed by zooxanthellae algae that produce by-products that the corals need to survive; a truly symbiotic relationship.</p><h2>How Changes in Lighting Effects Corals </h2><p>The coloration of coral polyps and tissues is dictated by these zooxanthellae. By differing the spectral output of our tank lighting we can actually influence the ultimate color/shading of our corals. How? Let's say that we have been using a 5500K VHO fluorescent setup at 220 watts. We get that itch to spend money and help our tank and animals by installing a 250-watt metal halide with a 10,000K lamp. Aside from the aesthetics of the rippling light show these lamps provide, we have suddenly changed the frequency of light that all the animals in our system have grown accustomed to. We use the term ""frequency"" to describe the change in CRI or spectral output.</p><p>Often, the corals will shrink up, close their polyps, or otherwise show their displeasure at this sudden and drastic change in their energy source. It's actually the billions of symbiotic algae that are recoiling, sending shock waves through their host and causing this rapid change in appearance. Within days, and sometimes even hours, the zooxanthellae will adapt to this new frequency and intensity by changing their absorption capabilities or their overall color. That's right, the coral's color is actually that of their hitch-hiking algae, adapting to the increases or decreases of ultraviolet and other energy-source factors.</p><p>Have you ever looked at a clam from the top of the tank, then lower your gaze to a sideways view, only to be disappointed? Strange how dull the clam's color appears from the side, while from above all those rich and vibrant colors seem to shout at the sky? Well, that's the clam's zooxanthellae algae, doing their thing, protecting the clam's delicate tissues from sunburn!</p><p>Whenever a change in lighting takes place, and don't be fooled, even replacing old tubes/lamps with the exact same wattage and URI can create the same response if the old tubes have been allowed to degrade past their useful spectral output, the system should be allowed to gradually adjust to this major change. How? We usually replace lamps and tubes just after the system shuts down for the night. I then replace or exchange old for new and ensure that next morning, not all the lights kick on at the same time, allowing intervals between pairs of types of tubes. If you have only a two-tube system this isn't possible, but the installation of a dimmer circuit like ones found on some electronic ballasts makes the chore much easier to accomplish.</p><p>Remember that corals and their zooxanthellae adapt to changes in their surroundings the same as we humans do. Whereas we may shade our eyes from bright sunlight, these animals have no such luxury. They must react as only they can, by recoil and a slow but gradual return to normal behavior. Interesting how we can't discuss lighting without getting involved in the coral's actual physical properties, isn't it? Well, after all, it IS the primary reason for lighting at all!</p><h2>About Lighting for SPS Corals </h2><p>SPS (Short/Small Polyped Stony) corals are by far the most numerous in the skeleton category. We will not delve into the physiology or other biological factors of these corals, other than to state that they, above all others, require the most dynamic of light sources.</p><p>Not until the advent of aquarium related halide lamps was this light source truly ready for our use. The incredible intensity of the metal halide lamp makes providing the right output of light ideal for maintaining these delicate-to-establish corals. Once they grab hold, SPS corals can be the most prolific of all their kind, growing at enormous rates and prompting many cuttings. These coral cuttings, known as frags, can then be propagated through ""coral-farming"", which is highly practiced by many hobbyists and commercial aquaculture companies today.</p><p>Naturally, factors other than the lights themselves contribute to the success of any coral, but once the water parameters and the lighting system are acceptable to the animals themselves, watch out. </p>",789

There are a number of things you can do ahead of time which will make tending your aquarium while you are away much easier.</p><p>Things that can go wrong include a power outage, overflowing pipe, heater malfunction, and other unfortunate situations. You most likely have a substantial amount of money invested in your aquarium. It is good insurance to have someone checking and available to have any problems addressed before you lose everything.</p><h2>Find an Aquarium Helper </h2><p>Ask someone to help you that you know is trustworthy, reliable, and preferably has knowledge about fish keeping, especially if you have a saltwater aquarium. In all likelihood, your helper's daily jobs will be limited to checking to see that everything is running well, doing a few simple things like feeding the tank inhabitants, turning the lights on and off, and possibly adding supplements if you have a reef tank.</p><p>If you plan to be away from home for some time and are unable to find someone to help you out, consider hiring a professional company in your area that specializes in aquarium maintenance care or babysitting services.</p><h2>Automate Important Tasks </h2><p>The most important tasks can be automated, leaving your helper very little to do other than to check to make sure things are running properly. The major tasks that can easily be automated are: topping off the tank, feeding and turning the lights on and off.</p><p>Run your automatic devices for a week or so before you leave, just to make sure that they are functioning properly. You'll probably wish that you had installed these items long ago.</p><h2>Perform All of the Regular Maintenance Tasks </h2><p>Do any necessary regular maintenance tasks several days prior to leaving. This includes water changes, glass cleaning, filter media cleaning, water testing, and other regular maintenance items. A system that is in tip-top shape will need little, if any care, and will give you peace of mind while making your helper's job much easier.</p><h2>Train Your Aquarium Helper </h2><p>Go over the basics of how your aquarium system is set up with your helper. If you are going away for a substantial period of time, you'll want to cover everything in greater detail. For this situation it is a good idea to plan ahead and have your helper spend time with you and your aquarium, showing and allowing the person do any task that may need to be performed. This is useful because visual or hands-on demonstrations for many people are much easier to understand and retain, compared to just verbal or written instructions.</p><p>Put together a ""things-to-do"" checklist. This will make your helper's job easier for remembering what needs to be done, and when, and can help ease your mind that nothing is being overlooked.</p><p>If you are using any kind of an online tank minder or computer software program to keep a record of your aquarium's statistics, show your helper how to use it. The information provided in the log will tell you all you need to know about what took place in your aquarium while you were gone. Besides, many of these types of programs have diagnostic or analysis capabilities, which can provide some troubleshooting assistance if a problem arises.</p><h2>Stock Up </h2><p>Be sure you are stocked up on all the supplies your helper will need to use. Even though there is little chance your helper will have to do a water change, storing a premixed batch of saltwater is a wise thing to do in case an emergency arises.</p><p>If you are not using an automatic fish feeder, it is a good idea to pre-measure the daily food amount into zip lock baggies and put the date on each bag. That will prevent your fish sitter from overfeeding the fish, which is the main reason fish die when being cared for by a fish sitter: overfeeding causing an ammonia increase and fish loss.</p><h2>Away You Go </h2><p>Leave phone numbers for where you can be reached, including an emergency number for a person or persons who may be able to assist with a problem if you cannot be contacted.</p><p>By making your aquarium system easier for someone else to take care of when you are not there, you will also be making it easier for you to maintain your aquarium when you are there.

The items used to keep your tank critters happy and healthy include electrically-powered air pumps, powerheads, protein skimmers, automatic feeders, and lights. For the most part, aquarium equipment runs on alternating current (AC) electricity, the same as almost all of the lights and appliances in your home do. In a power outage, your aquarium stops functioning.</p><h2>Aquarium Needs </h2><p>There are certain functions in a saltwater aquarium which are essential for its survival: gas exchange and water movement. Even the most sensitive corals in a reef tank can survive for days without intense light, but the viability of fish, invertebrates, corals and beneficial bacteria deteriorates rapidly without a reasonable supply of oxygen. This being the case, in the event of a power failure, the primary objective (both short and long-term) for the aquarist is to supply oxygen to the tank and move water (even periodically) about in the tank. This is bare-bones survival and some of your tank's filtration systems (wet/dry trickle, canister filter) will not be functioning. The nitrifying bacteria which resides in the tank (on the live rock, tanks walls, etc.) will live and continue to process ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates if oxygen is supplied at least periodically.</p><p>For most tanks, when operating properly, a vast majority of gas exchange (carbon dioxide out and oxygen in) takes place at the water surface of the tank. Protein skimmers and wet/dry trickle filters also contribute to gas exchange during normal operation, but will not be functioning during a power loss.</p><h2>Manual Aeration </h2><p>You can supply oxygen to the tank and provide some water circulation manually in events like power outages.</p><h3>Tips</h3><h2>Emergency Power </h2><p>Adam Goldstein tells how his aquariums have survived multiple power outages, some for up to three days. Normal automotive batteries should not be used indoors, as they emit sulfuric acid fumes (bad stuff), but Odyssey batteries are sealed (don't emit fumes) and are therefore safe to use indoors. Adam utilized two Odyssey automotive batteries with a 925 cold-cranking amps rating and a 400-watt DC-to-AC power inverter. With this setup, Adam could run his normal AC pumps and filters but he did not turn on his tank lights (they used too much electricity). While he recharged the batteries in his car, the batteries could be recharged using a solar panel.</p><p>While not a viable option for many people, having a gasoline-powered generator on hand may be the best long-term solution for dealing with a power outage. To be sure, they are not inexpensive, but for $400 to $500, you can purchase a 5,000-watt generator which will not only keep your aquarium(s) running normally, but also power a majority of the electrical appliances in your home. When you consider how much money you have invested in the critters in your marine aquarium, it's not a stretch to realize that a $500 investment in a generator is really cheap insurance. Plan for the worst and hope for the best.</p><p>If you do purchase a generator, you might want to seriously consider having an external 220-volt receptacle hard-wired into your house electric panel. This way, you won't have to leave a window open for all of the extension cords to run through. You will be able to run a lot of your electric devices with your normal outlets. When the power goes out, all you have to do is roll your generator out of storage, plug it into the receptacle and fire it up. Make sure that you trip your main circuit breaker, though. Otherwise, you will be supplying power to a lot of other people through the power lines. If you are not extremely comfortable with electric wiring, hire a licensed electrician to make your wiring modifications.</p><p>If you don't want to make the investment on the off chance that you will be hit with a long-term (more than a few hours) power outage, there are many retail outlets (Walmart is only one) that offer to refund your purchase of a generator if you return it in an unopened box.</p><p>No matter what your solution is to deal with a power outage, whether it is caused by a blizzard, hurricane or total power grid failure, the key to survival is to plan ahead.</p>",699
94,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lymphocystis-virus-in-saltwater-aquarium-fish-2925398,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Health,<h1>Lymphocystis in Saltwater Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Lymphocystis in Saltwater Aquarium Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Lymphocystis is a common virus in both saltwater and freshwater fish systems. Caused by a member of the family, this virus results in light-colored bumps on the surface of the fish's skin. Thankfully, these bumps do not cause serious health symptoms and tend to be self-limiting. Focusing on better health management can often clear most clinical signs, but prevention is key. Since this virus spreads through infected water, it's important to practice proper quarantine methods when introducing new fish to your aquarium. However, fish can also be asymptomatic, so it's normal for fish to experience this problem even with proper care when new tank residents are added.</p><h2>What Is Lymphocystis? </h2><p>Lymphocystis is caused by a a group of large iridoviruses, which makes the skin and fins of fish develop light-colored nodules that can be white to grey in coloration. The nodules themselves are made up of infected cells that become enlarged as the virus replicates, eventually stopping replication and causing the cell to burst. Bumps on the skin are visible because the cell is enlarged from 50,000 to 100,000 times the size of a normal, healthy cell.</p><p>Iridoviruses are found throughout all aquatic environments and can affect freshwater, brackish, and marine fishes. Other iridoviruses can also affect invertebrates and amphibians, and they are common in many parts of the world.</p><h2>Symptoms of Lymphocystis in Saltwater Fish </h2><p>The most common sign of lymphocystis is raised, white to grey nodules on the skin and fins. You may notice signs of this virus on the fish in your saltwater aquarium that develop in individual spots or clusters.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The papilloma-like nodules of lymphocystis can vary in size and cluster patterns throughout the body of the fish. They are often concentrated on the skin and fins, but aquarium owners may notice pigmentation of the nodules on patches of their fish's skin that are darker in color.</p><p>Lymphocystis is often confused with white spot disease, given its similar appearance, but other diseases including encysted parasites, epitheliocystis, epistylis, digenean trematodes, and others can also cause these symptoms. It is important that a correct diagnosis be made by a qualified aquatic veterinarian prior to pursuing any treatment.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Lymphocystis </h2><p>As with many other aquatic viruses, lymphocystis can spread horizontally throughout a system through infected water. This virus is naturally occurring in the environment, and it can even be passed through fish living in crowded conditions when being shipped to new areas. In aquariums, it most commonly develops from poor water quality or the introduction of infected fish to a tank of otherwise healthy fish. Lymphocystis is not believed to pass from parent fish to eggs.</p><p>Lymphocystis has a latent stage in which a fish may be carrying the virus, but not show any clinical signs. Usually, a secondary stress trigger (such as poor husbandry or water quality issues) causes the virus to replicate and the fish to start showing clinical signs. Once a fish is carrying lymphocystis, it can potentially spread it to any other fishes in the same system.</p><h2>Diagnosing Lymphocystis in Saltwater Fish </h2><p>In order to determine the cause of suspicious white to grey lumps on your fish, your aquatic veterinarian will take a skin sample for microscopic evaluation. Some asymptomatic fish may have signs of the disease affecting their internal organs, which cannot be seen by aquarium owners. Your veterinarian may take biopsies or perform histopathology, electron microscopy, or molecular examinations to determine whether your fish are infected. Depending on the results, they may recommend further testing. Treatment will vary based upon the test results.</p><p>In addition to hands-on testing, environmental evaluation such as water quality testing may be included to identify any potential stressors. Lymphocystis is often made worse by stressors that may not be obvious to newer aquarium owners.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>There is no treatment for lymphocystis in any species other than supportive care. It is critical to correctly diagnose the cause of any lumps on your fish and take deliberate steps to decrease any stressors in your tank. Stress impairs immune function in fish and can often lead to a lymphocystis outbreak. Asymptomatic carriers may be present in your system and never show any clinical signs, so identifying a virus-positive fish can be difficult.</p><p>Lymphocystis is often self-limiting, but supportive care is essential to the recovery of your fish. Try to be patient and provide good water quality and a proper diet as your fish recover. You can move them to a quarantine system, but the virus will already have spread around your tank once an individual fish shows clinical signs. Quarantining the most affected fish in your tank may help limit the volume of the virus to prevent severe symptoms from presenting throughout the tank's residents.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Lymphocystis </h2><p>Lymphocystis is not typically a fatal problem. This virus typically resolves on its own within six weeks, but severely infected fish are also susceptible to other infections caused by bacteria, fungi, and parasites. Secondary infections can increase mortality rates in fish with lymphocystis, so aquarium owners should always practice supportive care during outbreaks to help their fish recover.</p><h2>How to Prevent Lymphocystis </h2> <h3>Quarantine New Fish </h3><p>The best method to prevent lymphocystis from entering your system is to thoroughly quarantine all new fish, including invertebrates, for 30 to 60 days. The stress of capture, transport, and introduction to a new system is often enough to trigger a lymphocystis outbreak if your fish is a carrier. This usually leads to visible symptoms that aquarium owners can recognize, which indicates that a veterinarian should diagnose the fish properly before any actions are taken.</p><p>However, given the virus's latency status, quarantine is no guarantee to prevent the spread of lymphocystis. Aquarium equipment should be disinfected if there is any suspicion that it may have come into contact with this virus. Asymptomatic carriers can often clear quarantine and go on to infect healthy fish in your tank. Thankfully, given that this disease is mostly an aesthetic concern, most fish keepers should not worry about this virus too much. Giving proper supportive care will resolve most outbreaks in a few weeks.</p><h3>Keep Water Conditions Optimal </h3><p>Along with safely quarantining all new fish, aquarium owners can also help reduce the likelihood of their fish contracting lymphocystis by keeping the tank's water conditions optimal. Since outbreaks of this virus can be triggered by stress, it's important to handle fish gently along with avoiding overcrowding. Any conditions that may trigger physical stress in the fish should be prevented as often as possible.</p><h2>Is Lymphocystis Contagious to Humans? </h2><p>Although there are other iridoviruses that can infect humans, the fish versions are not zoonotic, or cannot spread to humans. There are bacteria, such as mycobacteria, that can transfer to humans, but viruses tend to be less zoonotic.</p>",1183

These ancient pet torture devices only make more work for you and cause severe health issues for your fish. Here's why it's best not to use one for your beloved pet.</p><h2>Why Are Fish Bowls Bad for Fish? </h2><p>There are many points that make bowls a poor choice for a fish pet. Yes, they may be easy to set up, but if you want to keep your fish healthy and happy, that's where the convenience stops. The following information will explain why keeping your fish in a bowl is bad for its health.</p><h3>Lack of Nitrogen Cycling</h3><p>The process of converting the primary fish waste of ammonia into its less toxic component, nitrate, requires a place for beneficial bacterial to grow. Usually, this is accomplished by a standard aquarium filter. Bacteria can also grow in the aquarium substrate, which many bowls have, but the bacteria requires aeration through water movement, which bowls lack due to not using any filtration. The bacteria in the substrate in a fish bowl does not get oxygen and the ammonia waste excreted by the fish does not pass through the gravel if there is no aeration or water flow, so the ammonia builds up. If the fish waste isn't removed, it will cause the fish to die.</p><h3>pH Swings</h3><p>Fish living in bowls are often subjected to extreme changes in water quality. This usually involves setting your fish aside in a small cup while performing a water change and cleaning the fish bowl. The biggest risk in doing this is a sudden swing in the water pH (acid-base balance). Water in a fish bowl will slowly use up its buffering capacity (carbonate hardness or kH) as your fish breathes and metabolizes the food. Once the kH is decreased, the pH will start to drop.</p><p>A sudden, heavy water change will then shoot this pH back to ""normal"" or tap water level. This can cause serious health issues and even death for your fish if they are not able to compensate for this sudden change in pH. With any aquarium or fish bowl, frequent partial water changes are necessary to remove wastes in the water and replenish the minerals that balance and buffer the pH.</p><h3>Lack of Oxygen </h3><p>Fish need oxygen. Another great feature of filters is that they are constantly adding oxygen to your aquarium through aeration. Yes, there is some oxygen absorption that occurs at the air-water interface, but in most instances if the water is not moving, relatively active fish will use up the oxygen faster than it can be replenished. You can drop in a small aerator, but many of these are too strong for most tiny bowls and can create currents fish have to constantly battle against. It is better to keep your fish in an aerated aquarium where the oxygen content in the water is consistent.</p><h3>Inconsistent Temperature </h3><p>Bowls are very small, making the water very susceptible to varying environmental temperatures. A bowl kept in the sun versus shade will vary widely in temperature. Most small bowls do not have room for an aquarium heater, so there is no way to keep the water consistently at the proper temperature. This can be a problem for temperate fish and is a severe problem for tropical fish that require warm water temperature year around, such as bettas.</p><h2>The Elevator Scenario </h2><p>In order to best illustrate the environment of a bowl, consider if you lived in an elevator. You have a clean space in which to live to start, and every once in awhile, food is dropped in the top. But you have no where to put your waste, limited space to explore, and a certain limit of oxygen. After time, the waste builds up, there's no where to put it or move it out to, and your oxygen starts to dwindle.</p><p>Suddenly, the elevator doors open, fresh air rushes in, causing you to get a little lightheaded, and the cleaning crew comes and does their thing. Sure, you'd manage to survive in this environment, provided you don't jump out of it, which some fish attempt to do, but you'd be far from thriving. Wouldn't you rather live in a house with air conditioning, heat and ventilation, and proper plumbing? Guess what? So would your fish.</p><h2>How to Upgrade to a Properly Filtered Aquarium </h2><p>So you've decided to join the healthy fish party.</p><h3>New Fish Acclimation</h3><p>When adding new fish to any aquarium, it is critical to acclimate them properly. This goes for tank upgrades too! Most often, you will not be bringing any of your fish's bowl water with them into their new tank, so be sure your fish is properly acclimated to their new aquarium's water pH and temperature before dumping them in!</p><h3>New Tank Syndrome</h3><p>Any new aquarium will undergo ""New Tank Syndrome,"" where new bacterial colonies are established to perform the nitrogen cycle: converting Ammonia to Nitrite then to Nitrate. Yes, those products on the pet store shelves say they will ""instantly"" start your nitrogen cycle, but they won't. They may add certain bacteria species that help with the break-down of fish wastes and may speed up the nitrogen cycle to only a few weeks, but they don't instantly add the amount of beneficial bacteria needed for an aquarium already full of fish.</p><p>The best method for cycling a new aquarium is starting with a low bioload of fish and slowly adding a few fish at a time over 4-6 weeks, until you have added the proper amount of fish for your aquarium size. We know this takes away the instant gratification, but a bowl upgrade usually has limited participants anyway. Adding too many fish too quickly will cause an ammonia spike that may kill all the fish!</p><p>You will see spikes of ammonia, nitrite and finally nitrate as the tank is ""cycled."" Buy a test kit and make sure their levels do not get high enough to harm your fish. If they are too high, do a water change. It will take 4-6 weeks to complete this transition.</p><h3>Environmental Adjustments </h3><p>If your fish have spent their life in a bowl, they are completely naïve about the wonders of a properly filtered aquarium. Do not be surprised if they hide and disappear for a few days. Once they get used to their new environment, they will start to come out and explore. It is a great idea to provide additional hiding places in new environments so your fish feel safe.</p>",1096
96,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bacterial-diseases-in-marine-aquarium-fish-2925202,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Health,<h1>Bacterial Diseases in Marine Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Bacterial Diseases in Marine Aquarium Fish</h1><p>The world is full of bacteria, in fact, our world would not exist as we know it without them. In 1884 a Danish physician, Christian Gram, discovered that bacteria could be separated into two distinctive groups, gram-positive and gram-negative. Using a particular staining process the bacteria could be determined either gram-positive or negative, depending on whether they retained (positive) or lost (negative) a violet color during this process. Most bacteria that cause disease in marine fish are gram-negative. Ones most commonly associated with these infections are of the genus and , as well as Myxobacteria.</p><h2>Causes </h2><p>Diagnosing bacterial diseases and why they occur is not always a simple, straight forward task. Bacterial infections can stem from many causes, even combinations of contributing causes, and can be topical (external, e.g., fin and tail rot and ulcer diseases), systemic (internal), or both. Healthy fish have a strong, natural resistance to bacteria and can usually fight it off on their own, but weak, sick and/or stressed fish can be very susceptible to this illness. The tiny open pores of the lateral line or open wounds are most often the point of entry for the onset of internal infections, but the soft tissues of the gills are also a prime entry point.</p><h2>Symptoms  </h2> <p>Bacterial diseases usually do not kill fish in a couple of days, especially larger ones, but moreover a one to two week period. However, some viral strains may do so. In any case, the prompt isolation of infected fish and treatment with an antibiotic in a QT (quarantine tank) is important. Even minor topical infections can progress quickly, and once the disease is in the systemic stage it affects the internal organs. The fish stops eating, the respiration rate increases and the fish eventually lays on the bottom and dies.</p><p>Most of the time only one or two fish in an aquarium at any given time show signs of an advanced case of bacterial infection. However, if the environmental conditions in the aquarium are poor enough, it can severely affect all of the fish. If this is the case it is best to perform a major water change, treat all of the fish in a QT and give the aquarium a major cleaning overhaul. This, as well as adding a UV sterilizer can sometimes help to prevent the perpetuation or re-occurrence of the same problem in the future.</p><h2>Using the Right Antibiotic </h2><p>Many bacteria are naturally resistant to specific drugs, so using the proper type of antibiotic is of the utmost importance. For example, gram-positive bacteria are often unaffected by tetracycline and streptomycin, while gram-negative bacteria may be unaffected by ampicillin, penicillin, erythromycin, and sulfa drugs. Some bacteria may also be unaffected by the usual dose but are susceptible to a higher dose.</p><p>Here is another good example. Mardel Laboratories makes Maracyn and Maracyn 2. Maracyn is erythromycin based and is a gram-positive bacteria treatment. Maracyn 2 is mincycline hydrochlor based and is a gram-negative bacteria treatment, as well as sufficiently absorbed through the skin to treat internal infections. Since most bacteria that cause disease in marine fish are gram-negative, and can quickly become systemic, Maracyn 2 would be the most effective choice. Mardel also makes and distributes Maracyn Plus, which is a broad-spectrum antibiotic for controlling the bacteria that cause mouth fungus, fin and tail rot, Popeye, dropsy, and ulcers.</p><p>You have to take into consideration that you will not be able to determine the exact type of bacteria you are dealing with, mutated strains can be produced, and both bacteria might be present. Broad-spectrum antibiotics, ones that kill both gram-negative and positive bacteria, such as neomycin, chloramphenicol, nitrofurazone (Furan-2) based products, skin absorbed kanamycin sulfate-based antibiotics such as Kanacyn/K-Mycin, and secondly tetracycline, are usually effective treatments. Aquatronics makes an ultra-wide spectrum antibiotic blend of nitrofurazone and kanamycin called Spectrogram that may suit your needs. If after a few days of using a particular antibiotic there appears to be no or little improvement in the health of the fish, try another one. These are just a few of the many available products on the market, so do your research to ensure that the medications you choose are safe to use in conjunction with each other if you decide to mix them.</p><p>The overuse of antibiotics for treating fish is the same as with people. The repeated or continued use of antibiotics creates selection pressure favoring the growth of antibiotic-resistant mutants. Our advice is not to use antibiotics as a cure-all treatment whenever you feel the fish ""might"" need it, but only when it is necessary.</p><p>Overall, the best method for treating bacterial infections is orally rather than topically (treating the water), or using a combination of both. Oral feeding can be accomplished by mixing an orally expect-able antibiotic into some highly palatable blended frozen food. Some antibiotics have instructions for oral applications, just read the labels for information. Keep in mind that if a fish has stopped eating altogether, oral feeding is not possible and chances are its days are numbered. If you do not want to hassle with mixing your own medicated foods there are various types available that you can purchase.</p><p>Since many antibiotics kill gram-negative bacteria and the biological nitrifying bacteria of an aquarium are also gram-negative, we recommend that you  treat the main aquarium. Whether it is a fish-only or a reef tank, a mild dose of antibiotics can greatly weaken the biological growth, a strong dose may kill it altogether, while invertebrates and marine algae may be killed off or affected as well. If you are compelled to use these or any other medications to treat the main aquarium, beware!</p><p>If you do use an antibiotic on your main tank, you might consider dosing the tank with a good Nitrifying Bacteria Tank Starter after the antibiotic treatment is complete.</p><p>The bottom line is whatever type of medication you use, make sure you get one that will treat the ailment you are dealing with. Follow the recommended dosages and directions for use on the product labels, and when in doubt, consult with your local fish store professional for assistance.</p>",988

Most marine fish diseases or afflictions, if detected, diagnosed and treated in their early stages can be corrected and cured.</p><p>To help with the diagnosis, check this list of potential symptoms. It can help you focus on a diagnosis and start early treatment. Utilizing a quarantine tank for treatment is usually the best course of action. If a number of your tank's occupants are showing the same symptoms, the entire tank should be treated.</p><p>Keep in mind that many of the treatments for fish diseases will weaken your tank's biological filter, so steps should be taken to minimize their effect on the ""good bacteria"" in your system.</p><h2>No Appetite </h2><p>It has been said that when something goes wrong with a marine fish, the first thing to go is their appetite. Lack of appetite in marine fish is normally the first symptom of a more serious problem. When a fish is first introduced to a new aquarium system it is not unusual for a fish not to eat for a day or two because of their new environment and/or shipping stress, but they should start eating after that. Use tips on getting new fish to eat In your marine aquarium to help your picky eaters start eating.</p><h2>White Dots on a Fish's Skin or Fins </h2><p>This is a sign of marine parasites such as (marine white spot disease),  (marine velvet, coral reef fish disease), ( or anemonefish disease) which can be difficult to identify. Since the treatment for these diseases is different, it is important to make a correct identification of the parasite before selecting a treatment.</p><h2>Popeye </h2><p>Popeye (an eye which is enlarged and protruding from its socket) is the result of an infection in the eye itself. It is normally caused by a scratch, abrasion or another injury to the eye which has become infected with bacteria in the surrounding water. </p><h2>Cloudy Eyes </h2><p>Cloudy eyes may be a sign of a bacterial infection due to an injury on another part of the fish. The bacteria enters the body of the fish and then can spread to the eyes, causing the cloudy appearance.</p><p>Introduction of the bacteria into the aquarium system can be from poor environmental conditions. If conditions are poor enough, the bacteria can bloom and overrun even the healthiest of fish. White cloudy water with the presence of sores on the fish can be signs of this problem.</p><h2>Frayed Fins </h2><p>Frayed fins on a fish are frequently caused by ammonia burns which have literally ""burnt"" the outer edges of the fins. The normal treatment for this is the same as for other infections.</p><p>Frayed fins can also be due to a bacterial infection caused by This bacterium can cause a fuzzy appearance to the skin or fins, similar to a fungal infection.<br/></p><h2>Rapid Gilling </h2><p>Rapid gilling (increased movement of the operculum by breathing rapidly) is a sign that the fish is not getting enough oxygen into its system. This can be caused by excitement, exercise or by the fish's gills being clogged by mucus, which inhibits the gills from being able to perform gas exchange (suffocation). If the fish is just swimming along normally, or at rest and it is gilling rapidly, it is a sign that the gills are damaged from excess mucus from bacteria, parasites, or chemicals in the water such as ammonia or chlorine.</p><p>Parasites lodged in the gills cause irritation to the point that the fish's immune system will produce more mucus to protect the gill membrane. Treat the fish for the appropriate parasite as soon as possible.</p><p>The other frequent cause of rapid gilling is an over-abundance of ammonia in the packing (shipping) water or aquarium water. While fish and invertebrates can tolerate a certain (low) level of ammonia (a toxin), higher levels can ""burn"" (irritate) the gills causing them to produce more mucus as a defense, which inhibits their ability to take in oxygen.</p><p>High levels of ammonia can also cause other problems with saltwater fish such as ragged, frayed or burnt fins and/or bacterial infections.</p><h2>Open Sores </h2><p>Open sores (raw spots) on a fish are frequently the result of a parasitic infestation that has left openings in the skin that have become infected by bacteria. The treatment is the same for any bacterial infection.</p><h2>Red fins </h2><p>Red fins on a fish usually indicate an internal bacterial infection caused by ammonia burns, skin parasites or trauma that has allowed bacteria to enter the body and spread.</p><h2>Faded Colors </h2><p>Faded colors on a fish can be due to something as simple and harmless as the fish assuming its nighttime colors or be a sign of a more serious condition. Faded colors are usually experienced in conjunction with other symptoms when they are not the fish's nighttime colors.</p><h2>Bloating or Abdominal Swelling </h2><p>Abdominal swelling or bloating is usually a sign of a kidney infection that prevents normal elimination of fluid from the body, often a common problem with wrasses that burrow in the substrate. When fish are collected in the wild from deep water and brought to the surface, swelling or bloating can be caused by the ""bends"" (lack of decompression), which is the result of bringing a fish up from deeper waters too quickly.</p><h2>Scratching on Rocks </h2><p> When a fish is seen scratching or rubbing on rocks or other objects (even the substrate), it is a sign that the fish's skin is irritated and the fish is trying to remove the irritating material. This is often called ""flashing"" due to the light color of the fish's belly becoming visible when they rub their sides on the rocks. The causative organism is normally a protozoa, either  (marine white spot disease) or  (, marine velvet, or coral reef fish disease).</p>",978

Because fish essentially live in their toilet and are constantly exposed to various pathogens, a strong immune system is critical to good overall fish health.</p><p>Support your fish's immune function by providing an excellent environment, taking into consideration their spatial requirements, desired territory or hiding spots, and preferred tankmates.</p><p>Feed a high-quality diet specific to the metabolism and digestion of your fish and be sure to replace it regularly. Test your water chemistry on a consistent basis and make sure maintenance takes top priority.</p><p>Eliminating stress from your fishes' environment goes a long way in ensuring their overall health and welfare.</p><p>Depending on the disease process, the clinical signs of a sick fish may be fairly obvious or more subtle. Physical signs of disease, such as bumps, fuzzy patches, scale loss, fin rips or changes in color are easy to spot for even novice hobbyists. Behavioral changes, such as changes in appetite, incorrect body positioning, and buoyancy disorders are harder to spot.</p><p>The best method of spotting disease in your fish is to check them daily at the same time and be sure to watch every fish closely. Once you know their normal behavior and patterns, it is easier to pick up on any small changes.</p><h2>Parasites </h2><p>Parasites most commonly enter an aquarium when new fish are added without proper quarantine. The stress of transport and adjustment to a new aquarium causes decreased immune function, allowing any parasites riding along to easily replicate and spread.</p><p>Common clinical signs of parasites in saltwater fish include external spots, bruises or scale loss from flashing, increased lethargy and respiratory effort or sudden death.</p> <p>Depending on the parasite present, your treatment options may vary. Contact your aquatic veterinarian in order to correctly identify the parasite and prescribe the best treatment available. Many parasite treatments are not coral or invertebrate-safe, so you may need a quarantine tank to treat infested fish.</p><h2>Bacteria</h2> <p>There are numerous bacteria species present in your aquarium. A fish's immune system can keep most bacteria in check most of the time. If your fish is stressed due to poor water quality, territory or space disputes, or poor nutrition, their immunity will decrease and they will be more likely to develop a secondary bacterial infection.</p><p>Common signs of bacterial disease in marine fish included lethargy, decreased appetite, ulcers, and sudden death. If you note any of these signs, be sure to test your water quality and evaluate your fish's diet.</p><p>Most of the time, if the primary stressor is identified and eliminated, your fish will not require any additional treatment. Severe infections may require treatment with antibiotics prescribed by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Lymphocystis</h2><p>There are many viruses that can affect saltwater fish. The most commonly seen is lymphocystis, an iridovirus that also has a freshwater counterpart.</p><p>Clinical signs of lymphocystis include small white or light-colored nodules on the fish's skin and fins. They may also form internally on various organs, which will not be visible.</p><p>The symptoms are easily confused with Marine White Spot disease or benign fin ray fractures. Your veterinarian will take a sample to examine under the microscope to determine the cause of the white nodules.</p><p>There is no effective medication for this disease at present, although your aquatic veterinarian can surgically remove growths from the fin margins. Most of the time, these lesions will resolve on their own, provided your fish is not stressed.</p><h2>Gas Bubble Disease</h2> <p>Gas bubble disease occurs when the water becomes supersaturated with pressurized gas and small microbubbles coalesce in the skin and eyes of fishes. The microbubbles are formed in the environment most commonly from misaligned plumbing sucking air into the filter tubing. The dissolved pressurized gas diffuses into the fish through the gills and bubbles out of the blood stream in various places. You may see one large bubble or multiple smaller bubbles in the skin, fins and/or eyes of your fish.</p><p>The bubbles can cause tissue necrosis and lead to fin erosion or internal organ damage. If left untreated, these bubbles can cause irritation and allow pathogens an easy route to enter into your fish's body.</p><p>Please do not attempt to pop the bubbles yourself! Your veterinarian will handle the procedure safely, with your fish properly anesthetized, and provide supportive care. It is critical to locate the source of the microbubbles so the condition does not recur.</p><h2>Head and Lateral Line Erosion (Hole in the Head Disease)</h2><p>Head and Lateral Line Erosion, more commonly known as Hole in the Head Disease, does not have a specific definitive cause. It can affect many species and causes erosion of the head and lateral line. Cases may range from a small spot on the head to the entirety of the face and side of the body having skin erosion.</p><p>There are many potential causes of Head and Lateral Line Erosion: poor water quality, high nitrite and nitrate, inadequate nutrition, protozoal parasites. Once the stressor is identified and eliminated, your fish will likely require supportive care in order to make a full recovery. Fish with severe cases may never return to their original appearance.</p><p>This is just a small sampling of the diseases that may affect saltwater fish. In order to decrease your fish's chances of getting sick, be sure to quarantine all new fish and invertebrate additions, provide a good environment with enough room for all, good water quality, and feed an appropriate diet. If you are concerned about your fish's health, contact your aquatic veterinarian.</p>",902

Inexpensive plastic food storage containers also work well if they are wide-mouthed.</p><h3>Nets </h3><p>The type and size of the net will vary based on the method and type of live food being collected. A large windsock shaped net is excellent for sweeping up insects in the tall grass. Nets with square or rectangular openings are good for use in water, as the straight edge allows the net to be dragged closely along the bottom.</p><h2>Where to Look </h2><p>You won't have to go far, most places are close to home. Collecting fresh foods for your fish can be turned into a fun family activity. If you live in the city, take the family on a trip to a park with a pond or creek, go to a campground by some water or woods, or simply go for a drive in the country.</p><h2>Plants and Trees </h2><p>Almost any plant or tree in your yard has a variety of insect life that would make a tasty fish meal. Small soft-bodied insects are suitable for virtually all fish. Cichlids enjoy larger hard-shelled insects, such as small beetles. Use a small brush to gently brush the insect off the plant and into a jar with a little water in the bottom. If the insect clings to the brush, dip it in water to dislodge it. Once you have a nice collection, swirl the water in the jar to dislodge the insects from the sides, and pour it right into the aquarium.</p><h2>Sidewalks </h2><p>Yes, look at your sidewalks, those ants are tasty morsels for your fish. Place a small piece of ripe fruit in a clean jar tipped on its side (a plastic peanut butter or mayonnaise jar works well). Once the fruit is covered with ants, pick up the jar and add enough water to cover the fruit. Cap the jar and swirl it gently to wash the ants off the fruit. Remove the fruit and pour the water with the ants into the tank. If you are fortunate enough to locate an ant nest, scoop up the eggs and feed those to your fish as well. The eggs are nutrient-packed, and your fish will gobble them up like candy.</p><h2>Patio Blocks and Rocks  </h2><p>Turn over a rock or sidewalk brick, and you'll usually find worms, larvae, and even insect eggs. If you live near a wooded area, take a walk and turn over dead branches, piles of leaves, etc. You'll find plenty of delectable live food for your aquarium fish. Use your brush or a stick to pick them up and drop them into a jar with a little warm water, then toss them in the tank when you get back.</p><h2>Ponds, Rivers, and Ditches  </h2><p>Wherever water collects you'll find an excellent source of live food for your fish. Dragging a large net through the water will yield many morsels. Daphnia can be found in abundance during the warm summer months, as are mosquito larvae. Place your harvested critters in a jar of water to keep them alive on the trip home.</p><h2>Fields and Pastures  </h2><p>A field or pasture is an excellent source of live food. Select a large fine-meshed net that tapers to a small end, similar to the shape of a windsock. Swish it quickly through the grass and put the contents into jar and cap it. Taking a slow drive at dusk with a net held outside the car window will often yield some interesting insects, not to mention it's a lot of fun (dogs know what they are doing when they hang their head out of the car window).</p><h2>After a Rainstorm  </h2><p>Run outside! The worms are out and waiting for you to scoop them up. Larger fish will eat them whole. Dice them up before feeding to the smaller fish.</p><p>What happens when summer is over? Even if you live in northern climates, you can still culture your own live foods all year long.</p>",826

Because of the immense size of the oceans, it is very difficult to get a good ""plague"" of any kind going in the oceans. You seldom see a true outbreak of parasites or any disease in the wild, due again to the size of the ocean and the fact that nature has provided a number of ""parasite pickers"" and carnivores to take care of most problems in their infancy. In the wild, when a fish starts slowing down due to disease or old age, it gets eaten.</p><p>Aquariums are a whole different story, though. A vast majority of salt aquariums are ""closed systems"" (not open to the ocean) and depend wholly on human intervention to keep the critters alive and healthy. Back when saltwater aquariums were in their infancy, the fish population took a lot of hits, due to the lack of knowledge of what the fish and invertebrates required. Fish didn't stay alive for very long. But, the science of saltwater aquaria has come a long, long way, particularly in the last few decades.</p><p>All that being said, fish, invertebrates, and corals do die in marine aquariums. The major causes of fish dying in aquariums are the following.</p><h2>Starvation and Diet </h2><p>New arrivals have a much greater chance of not eating hand fed foods for two reasons. First, many of the fish have not been properly fed from the time they were caught until the aquarist puts them in their tank. The collectors normally don't feed what they catch because it will make the fish poop in the shipping bag. Poop in the shipping bag equals ammonia in the water, which means less O<sub>2</sub>in the bag and burnt fins and gills.</p><p>For the most part, sick fish don't eat. Also, many aquarists don't offer the fish the food that they normally eat. Mandarinfish are a perfect example of this. Mandarinfish normally eat copepods and amphipods in the wild. They will not take any interest in that flake food you try to tempt them with. There are methods for getting finicky fish to eat, but that is a topic for another article. When a fish hasn't eaten for a while, they have a tendency to lose their appetite and it may be difficult to get them to start eating again, even if a desirable food is presented.</p><h2>Improper Acclimation </h2><p>Many aquarists do not acclimate their fish properly. They might adapt them to the temperature difference between the bag water and the aquarium water, but they don't take the time to adapt them to the difference in pH. Some fish (and many invertebrates) are more sensitive to pH change than others. Taking the extra time to slowly adjust the pH will eliminate many critter deaths in an aquarium.</p><h2>Parasite and Disease </h2><h2>Incompatibility </h2><p>No matter how much you might wish otherwise, a Volitans Lionfish will eat any fish it can get in its mouth. That might seem like an extreme example, but many other fish species will just not get along with certain other (or even some of their own) species. Using a good compatibility chart to see what probably won't work together in your tank before you buy a new addition will save you a lot of time and money.</p><h2>Poor Water Quality </h2><p>In order to survive, fish require an environment that is stable and within certain parameters. These parameters include proper salinity level, pH, low to no ammonia, and nitrites. Poor water quality contributes to immunological weakness, infections, and general poor health. Weak fish are a good target for other fish to pick on. Proper water quality can be maintained by a number of means: partial water changes, proper filtration, the addition of trace minerals, regularly balancing the pH and not overstocking the aquarium.</p><p>Understandably, beginning aquarists lose more fish than experienced aquarium keepers. Particularly with saltwater aquariums, there is a lot to know and the learning curve is pretty steep, to begin with.</p><p>It should be mentioned here that many problems in hobby (and others) marine aquariums are the end result of poor capture and shipping procedures. By the time a fish arrives in your LFS's display tank, it has gone through a lot of hands and been in a number of shipping bags. Normally, the collector catches the fish, takes it to a shipper who puts it in a bag and ships it to a trans-shipper or wholesaler, who puts it in his system, then re-bags it, and then ships it to your LFS. Knowing what to look for when purchasing fish will help you to avoid buying a specimen that will present problems in the future. </p><p>Disorders and Diseases of Fish.</p><p>The Ornamental Fish Trade: An Introduction with Perspectives for Responsible Aquarium Fish Ownership.</p>",839
101,https://www.thesprucepets.com/coral-eating-flatworms-in-reef-tanks-2924016,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Health,<h1>Coral Eating Flatworms in Reef Tanks</h1>,"<h1>Coral Eating Flatworms in Reef Tanks</h1><p>It was once thought to be impossible for the average aquarist with a reef tank to keep many corals in a healthy state. With the advancements in both science and technology over the past decade, it is now possible to keep corals in the home aquarium successfully. Owing largely to their lower lighting requirements, soft corals, such as Mushroom corals were among the first to yield good results in home aquariums. As aquarium lighting improved and the understanding of what lighting corals require, many small polyp stony (SPS) and large polyp stony (LPS) corals were added to the list of successfully kept corals.</p><p>As a result of the number and variety of corals being kept by hobbyists, ""fragging"" or fragmenting corals quickly became a popular method for reproducing corals on a fairly large scale. ""Frag swaps"" sprang up like yard sales and the number of corals moving from one aquarium to another grew rapidly. Unfortunately, the number of parasites and other pests that destroy corals also grew rapidly. Chief among these unwanted hitchhikers that affect corals are the Rust Brown Flatworm and the Acropora Eating Flatworm.</p><h2>Rust Brown Flatworm </h2><p>The Rust Brown Flatworm () is the most common flatworm found in home marine aquariums. It is rust brown to tan in color with a bright red dot about three-quarters of the way down its body and will reach a size of about 1/4"". They are oval and somewhat elongated with two tail-like appendages. It reproduces rapidly in nutrient-rich marine aquariums. In high concentrations on a coral's surface, these flatworms can actually keep adequate light from reaching the corals, effectively starving the coral. Some believe that this flatworm also consumes the resident zooxanthellae on the coral's surface. This flatworm is normally found in areas of the aquarium with low water movement and can be seen crawling on the surface of the corals.</p><h2>Acropora-Eating Flatworm </h2><p>This flatworm ( is white to opaque in color and oval in shape. It consumes the actual tissue of Acropora corals at a rapid rate. It seems to prefer the smaller polyped corals, such as the Tricolor and Staghorn species. This flatworms' presence can be detected by the rapid loss of tissue on Acropora specimens and the appearance of gold to brown egg masses left on the coral skeletons.</p><h2>Controlling Flatworms </h2><p>Both the Rust Brown Flatworm and the Acropora-Eating Flatworm can overrun the corals in your tank if left unchecked. There are several methods used to control flatworms in your tank.</p><h2>Quarantine </h2><p>When bringing new coral specimens home, it is wise to quarantine them as you would a new fish. While in quarantine, the new specimens can be closely inspected for flatworm infestation and can also be easily treated to eliminate whatever flatworms are present before introduction to your display tank.</p><h2>Mechanical Removal </h2><p>Unlike the Acropora-Eating Flatworm, the Rust Brown Flatworm does not attach itself to the coral and is easily removed by using a small (1/4"" airline) siphon. Simply just start a siphon, and then gently vacuum the flatworms from the surface of the corals, being careful not to contact the coral's surface with the tube.</p><p>Another method is to use a brief freshwater dip or bath. Simply submerge the coral in a container of dechlorinated freshwater for 5 to 10 seconds and shake the coral. Flatworms are very sensitive to changes in salinity and will lose their grip on the coral and fall to the bottom of the container in a short period of time. Before dipping the coral, balance the salinity and pH to match that of the saltwater the coral came from.</p><h2>Natural Method </h2><p>Flatworms have a number of natural predators, including the Sixline Wrasse (Pseudocheilinus hexataenia), the Yellow Wrasse, and the Spotted Mandarin. The biggest drawback to ridding your tank of flatworms with this method is that the fish will not consume every flatworm in the tank. The Blue Velvet Nudibranch (Chelidonura varians) is believed to do an excellent job of consuming flatworms. The greatest problem with the little 2-inch Blue Velvet is that flatworms are its entire diet and once it has rid your tank of all the flatworms, it will slowly starve to death.</p><h2>Chemical Treatment </h2><p>There are a number of chemical flatworm products on the market that seem to work fairly well without harming your other tank occupants. Salifert's Flatworm Exit  is a widely-used flatworm eradicator and has several good reports.</p><p>If you elect to use a chemical treatment, be sure to siphon all of the dead flatworms out of the tank, as they may contain toxins that can be released back into the tank water as the flatworms decay.</p><p>Obviously, the best treatment for flatworms is prevention. Quarantining new corals after giving them a freshwater bath would be the least intrusive method. While in quarantine, if a close inspection shows flatworm presence, treating only the infected coral will lessen any impact on your display tank.</p>",811
102,https://www.thesprucepets.com/live-foods-for-your-marine-animals-2920965,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Health,<h1>Live Saltwater Feeder Fish for Your Marine Animals</h1>,"<h1>Live Saltwater Feeder Fish for Your Marine Animals</h1><h2>Brine Shrimp & Live Feeder Fish</h2><p>When in nature most marine animals eat some source of live food. Whether it be small shrimp and crustaceans or fish, feeding your fish an occasional live food meal is beneficial for their diets. Take a look at some of the live food sources you can use.</p><h2>Brine Shrimp </h2><p>Brine shrimp are one of the most common live foods that you can use. They are something you can culture and grow yourself. To culture them you buy the eggs (cysts) in dried form.</p><p>The directions can typically be found on the container for hatching the eggs, but here are abbreviated instructions. You can use any clear plastic or glass container. Because most hobbyists do not need a large volume of brine shrimp, a two- to five-gallon size container will work well. If the container has a wide-open top, you will want to design a cover with a small hole in the center to fit your air hose through. This cover will help prevent overspray. Fill it 3/4 full with saltwater, add an airstone for movement of the water, add a few eggs (one or two teaspoons), keep the temperature at about 75-80 degrees and add some light (preferably sunlight). Depending on the quality of the eggs, hatching will occur in 24-48 hours.</p><p>To remove the brine shrimp for feeding, shine a light onto the bottom of the container as the shrimp will be drawn towards the light. You can siphon off the shrimp by using a tube inserted into the container and empty the shrimp into a cup. You may end up adding a small weight onto the hose to keep it on the bottom. You can use a dropper to remove the brine shrimp. A good place to find one is in the children's medicine section of the local pharmacy, or a turkey baster works well. With this method, you can use the dropper to directly squirt the brine shrimp in the exact location you want them to go, for example when feeding anemones and corals. Or you can also use a fine mesh net to scoop and remove them.</p><p>Aquarium Tank Brine Shrimp Hatchery from the Fishline site uses an old aquarium. 1/4 of the aquarium is without light to hatch to eggs and then the other 3/4's of the tank is lit. Unhatched eggs stay on the dark side, and the hatched brine shrimp migrate to the lighted side of the tank for easy harvesting.</p><p>Baby brine shrimp have a dense, oily yolk sac. It is believed that ""abnormal fat deposits in organs such as the kidney or liver can interfere with the normal structure and function of these organs. Fish with such conditions tend to be prone to disease."" Use caution not to overfeed young fish too many brine shrimp as this might contribute to an excess fatty build up in their bodies causing degeneration of the liver and kidney.</p><h2>Live Feeder Fish </h2><p>Marine animals like Lion Fish, Groupers, most Eels, Hawk Fish, Snappers, Anglers, and the like, are predatory animals. Their life on the reef consists of hunting and eating other small fish. By giving these animals small live fish to eat it is not only good for their diets, but it stimulates their activity and can be a large part of their overall fish health. It is a part of their natural characteristic to hunt. Besides, if you give them a good steady diet of their own, they will have less tendency to try and eat your other fish inhabitants.</p><p>Using freshwater feeder fish like goldfish, guppies, and mollies are the best. They are less expensive and do not carry marine diseases that can be introduced into your aquarium. If you do happen to buy brackish or saltwater feeder fishes, be sure to give them a two- to three-minute freshwater bath and remove any visible external parasites before putting them into your tank.</p><h2>Small Shrimp and Crustaceans </h2><h2>Live Plants </h2><p>For Tangs/Surgeon Fish, in particular, most of these fish are algae eaters. You can provide them with live cultured Caulerpa's or limu (a form of seaweed). Indo-Pacific Sea Farms in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii offer Certified Farm Cultured items like their Limu Plate and Tang Heaven-Natural Red Macro Algae Diet. Visit our Inverts & Plants Livestock Suppliers NetLinks to locate other live plant sources on the Web.</p><h2>Tubifex Worms </h2><p>This form of food has always been popular with freshwater aquarists but can apply to marine fish feeding too. You can form a small pressed ball and stuff it firmly into a crack or a coral head. Sometimes difficult to feed Butterflyfish are attracted to the movement of the worms and will start to pick and feed. Be careful when using this live food as it will foul a tank quickly if you overfeed, and any loose, dead or uneaten worms should be removed from the tank. Tubifex worms should not be the main diet source but used as an occasional treat.</p>",810
103,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-treat-flukes-in-fish-5204615,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Health,<h1>Flukes in Fish</h1>,"<h1>Flukes in Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2> <p>Flukes in fish are microscopic parasites that can infect the skin and gills. They commonly occur in freshwater fish that don't have proper quarantine protocols. Symptoms vary but often include red spots, excess mucus, and difficulty breathing. Stress makes fish especially vulnerable to contracting parasites, often due to dirty tank water. An aquatic veterinarian will diagnose flukes by looking at your fish under a microscope and will create a treatment plan based on the severity of the infestation. Fish respond well to medication and usually recover quickly. The best way to prevent flukes in fish is to keep your fish's stress levels low and quarantine new additions to the tank.</p><h2>What Are Flukes? </h2><p>Flukes are a common name for monogenean trematodes, or flatworms parasites that live in a fish's gills or skin. Flukes feed on skin cells and mucus, attaching themselves with their hooked mouths. The flukes reproduce by laying eggs, and warm water temperature accelerates the reproductive process. The parasite is invisible to the naked eye but can cause severe irritation to a fish's skin. The two types of flukes are Dactylogyrus and Gyrodactylus. The former infects the gills, and the latter infects the skin.<br/></p><h2>Symptoms of Flukes in Fish </h2><p>Symptoms of flukes in fish are generally non-specific. Because flukes are microscopic, only an aquatic veterinarian can discern the cause of your fish's symptoms. </p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Fluke symptoms can present in a variety of ways. You may notice your fish experiencing redness or inflammation on its skin, accompanied by itchiness. Your fish may scratch itself by rubbing against surfaces in its tank, resulting in scale loss. The parasite can cause your fish's skin to develop red dots and excess mucus. When the flukes feed on the blood on the gills, the oxygen supply is affected, and your fish may breathe rapidly or spend more time at the water's surface. The lack of oxygen may also cause lethargy. Flukes may destroy a fish's fin if they go untreated.</p><h2>Causes of Flukes </h2><p>Your fish may contract flukes for several reasons.</p><h2>Diagnosing Flukes in Fish </h2><p>Flukes are diagnosed using a biopsy or skin scrape of the fish's mucus or gills and examined under a microscope. Your vet will consider the fish's clinical symptoms, but due to their non-specificity, microscopic examination is the only definitive way to diagnose flukes. <br/></p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment for flukes will vary based on the water type (freshwater or saltwater), the number of fish affected, and the aquarium size. The duration of treatment will depend on which genus of fluke is present and the aquarium water temperature. Egg-laying flukes that live in cold water require longer treatment periods. Determination of the genus of fluke on your fish is helpful for the proper treatment since only certain life stages are treatable with medication.</p><p>Your veterinarian may recommend a medicated bath, oral medications, and, for severe infections, injections. Sometimes, oral medication may not be appropriate if the flukes have caused your fish to lose its appetite. Bath treatments are useful but can destroy biological filtration if not administered properly. Low-level infestations don't always warrant treatment, especially if your fish is asymptomatic. </p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Flukes </h2><p>Recovery for fish that have received treatment for flukes is usually quick and successful. Within days, you will notice your fish's behavior returning to normal, and by two weeks, your fish will likely recover fully. Gill flukes, however, are more challenging to treat than skin flukes. If the gill flukes are resistant to treatment, the prognosis is guarded, as the parasite can continue to damage the fish's tissue.</p><h2>How to Prevent Flukes </h2><p>To prevent fluke infestations, provide your fish with a low-stress environment. This includes good water quality and maintenance practices, feeding a proper, nutritious diet, and adhering to strict quarantine protocols for all new additions to the tank.</p><p>Use an isolated aquarium with separate equipment and filtration for a proper quarantine. Do not allow water to splash between systems; be sure to wash your hands between maintenance rotations. You must enforce a four to six-week quarantine period depending on your fish species and water temperature. It's significantly easier and cheaper to treat just a few fish in the isolation aquarium than in a larger aquarium or pond.<br/></p><h2>Are Flukes Contagious to Humans? </h2><p>Thankfully, monogenean flukes are not contagious to humans or other pets. They are strictly aquatic parasites and cannot survive outside of the water or penetrate human skin.<br/></p><p>A new addition to a tank includes fish and crustaceans, plants, and decorations. Anything that could transport a parasite into a tank should be quarantined.</p><p>Flukes aren't visible to the naked eye and can only be identified under a microscope. You won't be able to see the flukes themselves, but you may be able to see the red spots they leave behind.</p><p>The best way to keep your fish's stress low is to make sure the water in its tank is high quality.</p>",796

Most of the time, these bacteria do not cause any issues for your fish and exist in the detritus or debris in the aquarium substrate. However, if the fish's defenses are lowered due to stress or an immune-deficiency, bacteria can be fatal to fish.</p><h2>What is Vibriosis? </h2><p>Vibriosis is the disease caused by Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic rod bacteria from the genus. There are many strains of present in the aquatic environment at all times. Although they are more common in marine systems, some species can infect freshwater fish.</p><p>This disease can occur in both pet fish and aquaculture food fish species. However, it is not common in pet fish and scientists have developed effective preventative vaccines for aquacultured fish species.</p><p>There are known species that are more virulent and will cause more severe outbreaks than other species. Vibriosis is a zoonotic disease and can infect humans, sometimes with very serious consequences.</p><h2>Symptoms of Vibriosis in Fish </h2><p>There are many visible signs of vibriosis. These symptoms are not pathognomonic (specific to bacteria) and may be caused by other diseases.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Red Skin, Face, Fins, and Tail </h3><p>Vibriosis can result in a fish developing skin ulcerations and hemorrhaging because of the liquifying of its internal organs which can show up as redness and ulcerations of the skin, face, fin, and tail. The results are redness throughout the body, fins, tail, eyes, and mouth.</p><h3>Protruding Eyeballs and Corneal Opacity </h3><p>A fish with some strains of the bacteria can have serious eye problems, beginning with protruding eyeballs and corneal lesions that cause an opacity over the eyes. The eyes will soon ulcerate and cause corneal lesions, characterized by an initial opacity, followed by ulceration, and then parts of the eye may dissolve.</p><h3>Anorexia </h3><p>A fish with the disease may stop eating and become listless, which slows down its growth and internal functioning.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Vibriosis </h2><p>Vibriosis is caused by an infection of  bacteria species. There are many bacteria present at all times within the aquatic environment. More severe strains may enter a fish system if strict quarantine practices for new or sick fish are often ignored.</p><p>Immunocompromised fish, such as those stressed by poor water quality, bullying, or lack of sufficient nutrition, are more susceptible to bacterial infection. Traumatic wounds on a fish are also potential areas where there can be increased bacteria growth.</p><p>bacteria are known to be more problematic in warmer temperatures. If your aquarium or pond fluctuates in water temperature, you may see more clinical signs when the water is warmer compared to colder water temperatures.</p><h2>Diagnosing Vibrosis in Fish </h2><p>In a suspected vibriosis outbreak, your veterinarian will collect recently deceased fish or moribund fish close to death to be submitted to a specific laboratory. The laboratory will perform bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing to identify the prominent bacteria present and which antibiotic it is most susceptible to. There are known bacterial resistances to antibiotics, so cultures and sensitivity tests are critical.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Over-the-counter antibiotics are not effective against vibriosis. There are many known resistant strains of  that require the correct treatment. Once a diagnostic culture and sensitivity test has been performed, your veterinarian will determine the best course of action.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Vibriosis </h2><p>The prognosis for fish with vibriosis is poor. Many fish are never treated because they may not show any symptoms other than ulcers but die from the bacteria within a week or so of contracting the disease.</p><h2>How to Prevent Vibriosis </h2><p>To prevent a outbreak in your aquarium, you must maintain a healthy and low-stress environment for your fish.</p><h2>Is Vibriosis Contagious to Humans? </h2><p>Vibriosis is a known zoonotic disease and is contagious to humans. Bacteria can enter through cuts and scrapes on the skin, causing a localized infection and inflammation. Eating contaminated raw shellfish, such as oysters, can also spread the bacteria from fish to humans (infections from eating raw fish are less common). Immunocompromised individuals are at risk for more serious symptoms.</p><p>Certain strains of  are known as ""flesh-eating bacteria"" and can cause life-threatening infections in humans resulting in amputations if not treated early enough.

Infections will show up differently and may not show any clinical signs at all. This is a significant disease because it is zoonotic, and can be passed to humans through open wounds.</p><h2>What Is Fish Tuberculosis? </h2><p>There are several bacterial species within the genus. They are common environmental contaminants and do not require a fish host. spp. can infect mammals, birds, reptiles and fish. Some species will cause a localized infection, while others a full-body, systemic disease. This disease is called ""fish tuberculosis"" since is the causative agent for tuberculosis in humans.</p><h3>Symptoms of Fish Tuberculosis</h3><p>Non-specific, occasional deaths</p><p>Granulomas seen on internal organs during necropsy</p><p>Increase in secondary infections</p><p>The most common symptoms of fish tuberculosis is low, non-specific mortality, making it very hard to detect. Some infections may be present with no clinical signs for long periods of time.</p><h2>Causes of Fish Tuberculosis </h2><p>Since many spp. are common in the environment, not taking the time to properly wash your hands may transfer bacteria to your system.</p><h2>Treatment of Fish Tuberculosis </h2><p>There is no effective treatment of fish tuberculosis other than supportive care. Some fish can live for a long time with an infection and show no outward clinical signs of disease. You may see a long-term pattern of random deaths with no links to other diseases, fish additions, diet or other environmental causes, such as water quality.</p><p>If any fish test positive for fish tuberculosis in your system, it is assumed all fish are infected. Once a fish in your system has tested positive, you may keep the tank as a closed system, no new fish in or out, and be sure to take proper biosecurity precautions, such as gloves, or elect to depopulate and disinfect your system. Depopulation is recommended in immune-compromised environments.</p><h2>How to Prevent Fish Tuberculosis </h2><p>spp. are one of the hardest pathogens to detect, even with proper quarantine protocols. Even if you sacrifice one fish for testing, you may have another harboring the disease. Maintaining proper quarantine protocols for all new fish and plants is your best chance of catching an infection.</p><p>spp. cannot be treated with a UV sterilizer. The infection lives within the fish, where the UV light cannot penetrate.</p><h2>Is Fish Tuberculosis Contagious to Humans? </h2><p>Most humans are infected with spp. through open wounds in contact with infected fish or water. Fish with pointy spines, such as catfish, may introduce bacteria through a puncture when handling. This disease is also known as ""fish handler's disease"" or ""fish tank granuloma."" It commonly presents in humans as a localized rash or pustules. Wear proper protective equipment when handling pointy fish or you have an open wound on your hand.</p><p>Most spp. do not cause serious disease for healthy individuals. Immune compromised individuals are at higher risk for developing a systemic infection. If you are concerned you may have contracted spp.from a infected system, contact your physician.</p><h2>Veterinary Diagnostic Procedures for Fish Tuberculosis </h2><p>Any fish that pass away in quarantine should be immediately processed by your veterinarian. Fish tissue breaks down very rapidly, so diagnostic testing needs to happen quickly. If a fish has passed away hours earlier and been nibbled on by its tank mates, it will not be a good candidate for testing.</p><p>For small fish, there is no antemortem diagnosis for fish tuberculosis. Usually, in a suspected infection, one clinically-ill fish will be sacrificed for histopathology testing. Larger fish may be sampled by performing open coelomic surgery or laparoscopic surgery into the coelomic cavity. Granulomas may be visualized and sampled for diagnostic testing.</p><p>Specialized acid fast staining is required to confirm the presence of spp. All fish samples should be sent to a lab familiar with fish tissues since they are very different from other pet species.</p><h2>Proper Sanitation for Infected Systems </h2><p>Any porous materials such as branches or moss should be thrown away. There is no method to effectively clean these materials.

Black spot disease is also referred to as tang disease or black ich, although ich is actually caused by a different type of parasite. As the name suggests, the primary symptom of the infestation is tiny raised black dots on your fish's body.</p><p>The black spots on the fish are tiny Turbellaria flatworms. Luckily, these parasites are much less dangerous and life-threatening, as well as easier to treat, compared to protozoan parasites such as Oodinium, Cryptocaryon (ich disease) and Brooklynella. Nonetheless, fish infested with Turbellaria should be treated, as the parasite is unsightly and damaging to your fish's overall health.</p><h2>What Is Black Spot Disease? </h2><p>Black spot, or tang disease, is a parasitic infestation caused by a species of Turbellaria flatworm, typically Paravortex. Like other parasites, these worms require a host as part of their lifecycle.</p><p>The reproducing cyst (similar to an egg) of the worm settles in the substrate of the aquarium. After hatching, the juvenile (200 micrometers long by 50 μm wide) Paravortex worms can swim freely, and they leave the substrate seeking out a host fish. Once they find a suitable host fish, the juvenile Paravortex burrow into the epithelium of the fish's skin or gills and begin feeding on the fish's cell fluids.</p><p>After feeding on a host fish for about six days, the mature worm (now 2500 μm long and 750 μm wide) falls off the fish and descends into the substrate, where it forms a cyst.</p><p>About five days later, the encysted worm ruptures and releases a new population of young worms, which can immediately swim about and attach to a new host. The cycle starts again but in larger numbers.</p><h2>Symptoms of Black Spot in Fish </h2><p>The distinctive black spots of this disease are around the size of a grain of salt. The spots can be anywhere on the fish's body.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Once these worms start feeding on a host fish they acquire melanin pigmentation, which causes the appearance of black spots about the size of a grain of salt in the skin and fin membranes. The worms have the ability to freely move about on fish as the spots do not always remain stationary. On light-colored fish, they are easy to see, whereas on dark-colored ones they may go unnoticed at first.</p><p>As with other surface parasites, the infested fish will scratch up against objects or the substrate in an attempt to dislodge the parasites. If the infestation is allowed to progress, the fish can become lethargic, lose its appetite, and fade in color. If the gills are affected, rapid respiration develops.</p><h2>Causes of Black Spot </h2><p>Black spot, or tang disease, is caused by an infestation with a tiny parasitic worm, typically the Paravortex species of Tubullarian flatworms. Although not an extremely common problem in home fish tanks, the worm reproduces rapidly, and the infestation can quickly spread throughout a tank's inhabitants without prompt treatment.</p><h2>Diagnosing Black Spot in Fish </h2><p>You will generally be able to diagnose this condition by the distinctive small black spots, which are slightly raised. If you are uncertain, however, your aquatic veterinarian can diagnose the parasites by visual examination, or by scraping a bit of sample off your infected fish's skin, and then examining it under a microscope.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Gravel vacuuming the aquarium may help reduce encysted worms in the substrate during an outbreak. Affected fish should be placed in a quarantine tank to prevent increasing the parasite population in the main aquarium. Give all infested fish a freshwater dip, followed by a formalin bath, following the manufacturer's instructions for mixing and using the product. Praziquantel is another treatment option that has been used with some success to treat affected fish in quarantine tanks.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Black Spot </h2><p>While it can take persistence to rid your tank of the flatworm, fortunately, most fish will recover from the infestation with prompt treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Black Spot </h2><p>Reinfection will occur no matter how effectively the fish have been treated if these parasitic Turbellarian worms are not eradicated from the main aquarium. The worms can survive for several months without a host. Here are some suggestions to help prevent reinfection.</p>",730

In fact, the answer is ""both."" As juveniles, these beautiful saltwater fish are bright red with white spots outlined in black. As adults, however, they are multicolored fish with bright yellow tails. If you decide to add a Yellowtail Coris Wrasse to your aquarium, you'll get to experience the pleasure of watching this fascinating fish literally change its spots.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Red Coris Wrasse, Yellow Tail Coris Wrasse, Clown Wrasse, Red Labrid Wrasse, Gaimard's Wrasse</p><p>Adult Size: To about 14 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Several years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Yellowtail Coris Wrasse is a reef-dweller that lives on most reefs in the Indo-Pacific, the Red Sea, Fiji, and the Hawaiian Islands. A carnivore, it feeds on the mollusks and other small invertebrates found on the reefs; as a result, it is not considered to be a ""reef safe"" fish to keep in an aquarium.  </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>These fish start life as small red fish with black-rimmed white spots along their dorsal rim. As juvenile wrasse develop into adulthood, they change appearance completely. Their bright red bodies darken, blue specks appear, the fins gain decorative yellow, red, and blue markings, the face gains orange and green stripes, and they develop a bright yellow tail.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Yellowtail Coris Wrasse can be aggressive toward others of its own species, so it's wisest to keep just one in a tank (or a mated pair). Other fish that can make good tankmates include Blennies, Butterflies, Boxfish, Clownfish, Hawkfish, Rabbitfish, and Angelfish. </p><h2>Yellowtail Coris Wrasse Habitat and Care </h2><p>Most aquarium owners buy their Yellowtail Coris Wrasse fish as juveniles that have already developed to some degrees. That's because tiny juveniles typically do not fare well in captivity. It is not unusual for them to waste away and starve to death due to the lack of accepting food, and thus not taking in the high caloric diet they require to survive. It is best to obtain a sub-adult specimen of more than two inches in size, and one that is already eating well to help avoid problems with starvation.</p><p>Aquarium owners will want to house this species in a large tank (100 gallons or more) to provide their pets with plenty of swimming room. The substrate should consist of a two to four-inch bed of soft sand, as Yellowtail Coris Wrasse like to bury themselves in the sand to sleep at night and for protection when frightened or harassed. It's important to be aware that this species searches for food by turning over pieces of live rock and coral. Large individuals are very adept at this task, and thus can easily move objects around, which may cause aquarium rock formations to become unstable. This species prefers a brightly lit aquarium, and requires a tight cover as they can and will jump.</p><p>While the species is generally hardy, they are prone to developing internal bacterial infections associated with the bladder due to poor substrate environment in an aquarium.</p><h2>Yellowtail Coris Wrasse Diet </h2><p>A carnivore, the Yellowtail Coris Wrasse possesses two prominent teeth in the front of each jaw that are used for feeding on its favorite prey: nails, hermit crabs, crabs, shrimps, mollusks, and sea urchins. It will eat nuisance bristle worms, but other beneficial worms as well, including decorative tube species. These fish should be fed three times a day on a hardy diet of suitably bite-sized pieces of meaty foods that includes fresh or frozen seafoods, live or frozen brine and mysid shrimp, live glass or ghost shrimp, live black worms, and flake food.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Unlike many fish, the male and female look quite different from one another. Juveniles of both sexes are red with black-rimmed white ""saddles."" As adults, males are dark gray with a green bar behind the gill. Females, however, are dark blue with a red fringe.  </p><h2>Breeding of the Yellowtail Coris Wrasse </h2><p>Yellowtail Coris Wrasse develop mating pairs, and lay eggs in nests. It is very unusual for this species to procreate in an aquarium environment.</p>",683

It and its rather uncommon relative, the big longnose (Forcipiger longirostris) have one of the longest Hawaiian fish names, lau-wiliwili-nukunuku-'oi-'oi. Its meaning is ""leaf of the wili-wili tree with a sharp nose."" The hue of the fish is similar to the coloring of the big, billowy leaves of the Hawaiian wili-wili tree. This fish is prevalent in southern Hawaiian waters by Maui and Hawaii Island.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Yellow longnose butterflyfish, forceps fish, long-nosed butterflyfish, long-nosed coral fish</p><p>Adult Size: 8.5 inches (22 centimeters)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8.5 inches (22 centimeters)</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Chaetodontidae</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>This fish is found from Hawaii and the Revillagigedo Islands southward into eastern and central Polynesia and then westward across the tropical Pacific Ocean, through the East Indies, and across the Indian Ocean to the coast of Africa and the Red Sea.</p><p>These butterflyfish spend most of their time near exposed seaward reefs where there is lots of coral growth, rocky caves, and ledges, and they are also found in lagoon reefs. They inhabit depths from between 3 to 476 feet with environments that include everything from shallow flats to very deep walls. They are usually seen in pairs though sometimes seen in small groups of as many as five individuals, and occasionally they are seen alone.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The yellow longnose butterflyfish has a disc-like shaped body that is laterally compressed and it has a long protruding snout tipped with a small mouth. The dorsal fin is continuous and it has a rounded tail fin. This fish has a bright yellow body as well as yellow dorsal, anal, and pelvic fins. There is a black bar over the nape covering the upper half of the eyes, giving a mask-like appearance. The rear edge of the dorsal and anal fins can be edged in blue and there is a prominent eye-spot on the anal fin just below the caudal peduncle. The pectoral and caudal fins are transparent.</p><p>The yellow longnose species has a shorter snout with a larger mouth at the end than its big longnose butterflyfish counterpart. These fish are named forceps fish, which stems from Latin forcipiger, meaning ""forceps bearing."" The mouths of both types of fish resemble a pair of surgical forceps. These fish use their elongated mouths to pluck invertebrate prey out of coral reef crevices.</p><p>The two species can also be identified correctly by counting their dorsal spines. The yellow longnose butterflyfish usually has 12 spines and from 22 to 24 soft rays, while the big longnose usually has 12 spines and from 25 to 28 soft rays.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>In general, it is a peaceful fish. Butterflyfish are usually best kept singly or in larger aquariums as a mated pair. It does better with other non-aggressive fish, but can be placed into a moderately-aggressive community if introduced into the aquarium first. Smaller non-aggressive fishes like cardinalfish, gobies, tilefish, fairy basslets, fairy and flasher wrasses are good candidates as tank mates. Also, larger and rather territorial angelfish can be kept together with this species. </p><p>It can be kept with some of the other butterflyfish but will be aggressive towards other members of its own kind, as well as other butterflyfish in its same genus. Small but very territorial fishes like dottybacks should be avoided. Also, fish like bass or scorpionfish, even if they are small enough, should be avoided.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>Yellow longnose butterflyfish need plenty of shelter and room to swim around. These fish prefer rockwork, preferably well developed live rock, that has caves or overhangs. They also need moderate water movement.</p><p>This fish is not recommended for reef-type aquariums since it is a known coral eater. They are best kept in ""fish only"" aquariums. It will need a well established, matured for at least six or more months, tank.</p><p>This fish is sensitive to even the lowest levels of ammonia and other changes in its environment that result in poor water quality. Sudden massive water changes can cause trouble. Consider water changes at 10 percent biweekly or 20 percent monthly. </p><h2>Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish Diet </h2><p>Yellow longnose butterflyfish are omnivorous but are primarily meat eaters. In the wild, it is found in areas with abundant corals, picking in between coral heads with its long snout. It feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates including stony coral polyps and soft coral polyps as well as small animal prey including crustaceans.</p><p>In the aquarium, offer meaty foods, dried flakes, prepared frozen foods, shrimp, and tablets. It may enjoy eating live brine shrimp but should be fed as many different foods as it will eat, as it will not thrive on that diet alone. The yellow longnose can adapt to eating typical aquarium butterflyfish fare rather quickly. Several sponge-based frozen foods are now available and can also be fed to butterflyfish. Vegetables like Japanese nori seaweed may also be favored. Feed it at least twice a day. If it is a tiny juvenile, food should be provided frequently in small quantities three or four times every day. Because it is such as thin bodied fish, if this fish is not provided with an adequate and ample diet, it can easily starve in captivity.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>No sexual difference is noted for this species. These fish are gonochoristic, meaning that each fish is either a male or a female (they do not morph into another sex at any point in their life).</p><h2>Breeding the Yellow Longnose Butterflyfish </h2><p>This species has not been successfully spawned or cultivated in captivity. In the wild, like many other marine organisms, butterflyfish reproduce by external fertilization. They are pelagic, or egg scatterers that release many tiny eggs into the planktonic water column where they float with the currents until they hatch. Once hatched, the fry are in a post-larval state. Their body, extending from the head, is covered with large bony plates.</p>",958

Although individual behavior may vary, most male betta fish in the pet fish trade need to be kept in separate aquariums, and shouldn't even be able to see other males. Fighting in betta fish can be potentially lethal, so owners need to take effective steps to prevent their male betta fish from fighting.</p><h2>What Is Fighting in Betta Fish? </h2><p>The most common fighting behavior in betta fish is known as ""flaring."" In this demonstration, a male betta fish will push both operculums (gill covers) forward to suggest a larger body size. This is similar to a puffer fish expanding and flaring its spines when under duress.</p><p>calwhiz / Flickr</p><p>Other behaviors involve physical interaction between the two fish. Physical interactions may include one fish ramming, or swimming directly into the other fish, or biting or nipping at the fins. Two males may also lock their lips together and wrestle.</p><h2>Why Do Betta Fish Fight? </h2><p>Betta fish fight to establish a territory, including food resources, shelter, and access to females. This is a common cause of aggressive behavior in many different fish species.</p><p>There is debate over whether this fighting behavior is innate or a consequence of how betta fish are reared. Studies have shown that bettas reared in a group have less aggressive tendencies. It is hard to know with some suppliers how your betta fish were reared and how aggressive they may be, and may take a few weeks for you to be able to tell their level of aggression. Most male bettas, though, are aggressive and cannot be kept with other bettas.</p><p>In their native country of Thailand, betta fish have a history of being kept as competitive fighters. Studies observing competitive fights have shown that fish raised in isolation, without other betta fish, tend to be more aggressive and fight for a longer period of time. Just like dog fighting, keeping fish for this specific function is a severe welfare concern.</p><p>Female bettas are not usually aggressive to each other. Female bettas are commonly kept in a small group, known as a ""sorority"" or ""harem,"" and individual fish may be more or less aggressive than others in a group, often leading to an established hierarchy. Once established, the addition of new females to the harem may result in increased fighting as a new hierarchy is established. Female bettas are commonly kept in an aquarium with other fish species of similar size.</p><p>While male bettas can't be housed with other bettas, a single male betta can be kept in the same aquarium with other non-aggressive fish species. Female bettas can also be housed with other fish species. Some betta fish may be aggressive to fish of other species kept in the same tank, if those fish have flowing fins similar to another betta. It is critical to add fish that are not aggressive and good community players to your aquarium. It will depend on your betta's individual personality to determine if they can be kept with additional species. Some bettas are too aggressive to be kept with any other fish. It is best that betta fish are added to the aquarium last in order to decrease any potential aggressive interactions.</p><h2>Signs of Fighting in Betta Fish </h2><p>The most common signs of fighting are gill flaring, ramming or fin nipping. If you do not see your fish actively fighting, you may see other signs, including missing scales, torn fins, or increased hiding. Severe signs include lethargy, decreased appetite, prolonged hiding periods, and sudden death. If trying to keep female bettas together and you see signs of fighting, the aggressive fish must be separated.</p><p>""Fin rot"" or fraying fins is a common problem in betta fish, because of their long flowing fins. Often, this is a general sign of illness and a poorly functioning immune system. Another common cause of fin damage is overdecorating with lots of items that can tear betta fins.</p><h2>How to Stop Fighting </h2><p>The best way to stop your fish from fighting is to only have one male fish per tank. If keeping bettas in individual tanks, provide a visual barrier between the two tanks so the fish cannot see each other at any time. Simple aquarium backgrounds or a piece of cardboard are effective visual barriers.</p><p>Visual toys that have mirrors in them, or mirrors placed near the aquarium should also be removed. Bettas have been known to aggressively respond to their own reflections. Although these may be considered ""enrichment"" items, these are known stressors in bettas and should not be added to betta tanks. Injuries can occur when betta fish attack toys or their reflections in a mirror.</p><p>Treatments have been attempted with marijuana and Prozac to decrease aggressive betta fish behavior. Bettas responded with decreased aggressive behavior with both treatments, but became tolerant of the marijuana dose. Always consult your veterinarian before embarking on any treatments for your pet fish.</p><p>Iwata E, Masamoto K, Kuga H, Ogino M.

Bettas and other pet fish have a very simple gastrointestinal tract, with a short esophagus and intestine ready to absorb all the good stuff from their food and remove the leftovers. Poop is a natural process of your fish's digestion, but how do you know if its bowel movements are normal or not, and what can you do if your fish isn't pooping?</p><h2>Causes of Betta Fish Not Pooping </h2><h3>They are pooping, but you aren't seeing it </h3><p>Most fish owners cannot watch their fish 24 hours a day, so during the day or overnight, your fish is likely pooping. Instead of looking for poop on your fish, try to examine its environment.<br/></p><p>Fish poop is usually long and stringy and should usually be brown or black, but may be similar to the color of the fish's food. White or clear fecal movements are not actually a sign of disease, but a bowel movement without any food present. Just like us, fish rely on mucus to slide food along their intestines, which gives poop this white or milky appearance. White feces can happen with fish who eat very intermittently, but their GI system is still processing. This can also mean your fish is living at an inappropriate temperature, where its metabolism is ramped up too fast and churning out empty fecal casts.<br/></p><p>Depending on how much your fish eats, how frequently meals are given and the temperature of its water, you can expect to see one to a few pieces of feces per day. Given its simple Gastrointestinal (GI) tract, a fish that is fed at least once a day, such as bettas, should poop at least once a day, but it may be in the middle of the night and disintegrate before you can find it the next day. Gravel vacuuming the bottom of the aquarium will remove any accumulated feces and you can monitor the quantity through regular cleaning.<br/></p><h3>Not Getting Enough to Eat </h3><p>What goes in must come out, and if you aren't getting enough to eat, not much is going to come out the other end. Bettas are tropical fish and should be fed two to three times per day at a water temperature of 78 to 82 Fahrenheit (26 to 28 Celsius). Be sure that you are feeding food that has been opened within the past six months in order to have a good nutritional profile. The amount of fish food given should be consumed in 3-5 minutes. If it is gone too soon, give a little more; if it takes the fish longer than that to eat it, you may be overfeeding the fish.</p><h3>Overfeeding </h3><p>It may sound counterintuitive, but overfeeding your betta can have serious consequences. Overfeeding without adequate processing of the diet can lead to an impaction that can halt all movement of food down the gastrointestinal tract. Often, your betta will continue to eat without pooping at all and have a distended belly. If you are concerned about your betta possibly being overfed and constipated, contact your aquatic veterinarian ASAP.</p><h3>Decreased Appetite </h3><p>If you are feeding or offering adequate food, your betta may simply not be interested in eating, which can have many causes. Here is a link to a few causes why your betta fish isn't eating.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If you have not seen your betta poop for a while, do not panic. The fecal remnants can disintegrate very quickly when mixed in with the bottom gravel, so you may not even see consistent signs.</p><p>Removing all the substrate and décor in your fish's tank can help you to better see the environment and assess your fish's bowel movements. Your fish will likely not appreciate the sudden environmental change, and can become stressed, but you will be able to clearly see any recent bowel movements. Gravel vacuums can also be used to clean the bottom substrate and assess feces.</p><p>It is critical that you check your betta's tank water temperature to make sure it is warm enough for your Betta's metabolism to work correctly. Be sure that you are feeding your fish appropriately and have opened your container of food within the last 6 months. Older food loses some of its nutritional value.</p><p>If you are 100% certain that your betta fish isn't pooping and its temperature is appropriate, evaluate its diet and feeding. If that all checks out, contact your aquatic veterinarian for additional assistance.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Not Pooping </h2><p>To ensure your betta is healthy with normal bowel movements, it is critical to keep it in a heated, filtered aquarium, check your water quality regularly, keep up with your regular maintenance and feed it appropriately. If you have any concerns about your fish's health or wellbeing, contact your local aquatic veterinarian as soon as possible to get help for your fish before it is too late.</p>",826

Thankfully, there are a few things you can investigate before you need to ask for help from a veterinarian. Most of these relate to inappropriate husbandry, or how well you take care of your betta. Making a few small changes as soon as possible will considerably improve the chances that your betta will return to normal eating.</p><h2>Causes of Betta Fish Not Eating </h2><p>There are a few causes to why your betta fish may not be eating.<br/></p><h3>Water Quality </h3><p>Fish that are in poor water quality get stressed. Because fish cannot escape this environment, though some may jump out of their tank or bowl trying to do so, the constant exposure to bad water results in a chronic stress state. With a fish's immune system on stress overload, they don't feel well, and as a result, have lower immune function, reproductive effort and growth, and reduced appetite.</p><p>Thankfully, poor water quality is one of the easiest things to fix. Get your betta out of that antiquated bowl and into a five to 10 gallon heated, filtered aquarium. Test your water quality regularly with a liquid-based test kit and do your regular maintenance so your water quality parameters stay within normal ranges.<br/></p><h3>Poor Quality Food </h3><p>No betta will ever actually finish a container of betta food in a timely manner. If the containers were the appropriate size, you'd never find them on the pet store shelves! After about six months, fish foods will lose most of the water-soluble vitamin content, including vitamin C. Not to mention that all food gets stale after being opened repeatedly every day. Bettas rely on their sense of smell to find their food and if it's getting old, it does not smell very good.</p><p>All bettas should be fed two to three times per day. Use a fresh pelleted diet that is replaced at least every six months. Due to varying pellet size, feed as many pellets per meal that could theoretically fit within one of your fish's eyeballs.</p><p>Feeding old food for too long can have serious consequences for your fish's health. Old food loses its nutritional value, especially vitamins. Without immune boosting vitamins C and E, your fish is significantly more prone to secondary infections from the surrounding environment.</p><h3>Overfeeding</h3><p>Some bettas have eyes bigger than their stomachs and will happily consume all morsels in their tank. However, if their metabolism cannot keep up, food starts to get backed up and can cause serious GI distress. Overfed bettas can present with severely distended bellies and will need help ASAP. Bettas should be fed twice daily, but only a small amount of food each time: about as many pellets as would equal the size of their eyeball. Any uneaten food that remains on the bottom of the aquarium should be removed with a net or gravel vacuum.<br/></p><h3>Inappropriate Temperature </h3><p>Bettas are tropical fish and therefore require a heater in their tank. Pet fish are ectotherms, meaning their metabolism and immune function is dependent on their surrounding environmental temperature. Various species of fish have a ""sweet spot"" for temperature ranges in order to be in optimal health. Bettas require heat around 78 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit (25 to 28 Celsius). Be sure to use a commercial aquarium heater designed for the size of your aquarium. Larger heaters may be too big for a Betta Aquarium's small volume of water, so make sure you check your heater's function by having a submerged thermometer in your betta's tank.</p><p>If you do not have a heater and your water is too cold, your betta cannot properly digest their meal. This can lead to an impaction where the gastrointestinal (GI) tract fills with food and cannot exit the fish. Affected fish will present with severely distended bellies and need to be seen by an aquatic veterinarian.<br/></p><h3>Competition </h3><p>Betta fish are notorious for viciously defending their territory. Male bettas should never be kept together or even within sight of each other. Some female bettas can also be very aggressive, depending on their individual temperament. Fish that are too concerned about their tankmates can easily become stressed and stop eating.</p><h3>Illness and Disease </h3><p>Even with the best care and housing, your betta can still become ill. If you have checked off all of the above points and can still not figure out what is wrong, it's time to call a professional. Especially if you see other serious signs of illness, such as lethargy, change in color, rips or tears in the fins or pine-coning of the scales. The sooner you get your betta help, the better the prognosis will be.<br/></p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>If you notice your betta is not eating, the first thing to do is test your water chemistry. If any of your parameters are off, especially temperature, take steps to correct it as soon as possible. Remember, any changes to pH or temperature should take place very slowly so you do not shock your fish.</p><p>If your water quality is all within the normal range, assess your betta's diet. When did you buy it? Does it look and smell like it did when you first bought it? Any suspicious or old diets need to be replaced.</p><p>Once you have assessed any environmental or dietary issues, you should call your aquatic veterinarian for additional guidance and diagnostics.</p><h2>How to Prevent Decreased Appetite </h2><p>The best method to ensure a happy and healthy betta is to house them in a heated, filtered aquarium, keep their water chemistry within range and feed them appropriately. If you have any concerns about their health or husbandry, contact your local aquatic veterinarian.</p>",951

Pellets come in various sizes, so you will likely find one that is appropriate for the size of your fish. Flakes have a higher surface area to mass ratio, meaning they will float better than pellets, but goldfish that eat food at the surface may ingest air, and round bodied goldfish such as orandas may develop floating disorders. Pellets tend to slowly sink and your goldfish can eat them while they drop and will even eat them off the bottom of the aquarium. If you do use flake foods for your goldfish, you can hold the pinch of food under the water surface to release it, so the goldfish eat it while it is falling, rather than floating at the surface.</p><p>Fish food should be kept in sealed containers in cool environment and used within one to six months of purchasing the food container. If kept longer, the vitamin content may decrease in the food. Flake food may spoil faster than pelleted food, and lose moisture. Water-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin C which is critical for proper immune function decreases faster in flakes than in pellets. If you store fish food in the refrigerator or freezer it will keep fresh longer. Do not leave food out in the sunshine or at high temperatures if using it for pond fish.</p><h3>Protein </h3><p>Protein is the main source of energy for fish. Carbohydrates are not well processed and a diet high in carbohydrates can lead to liver damage. For goldfish, a maintenance level around 30% is recommended based on current research. Juvenile goldfish and those individuals involved in breeding should be fed a higher level, around 35%.</p><p>Feeding a higher protein diet will lead to a fast growing fish and lots of nitrogenous waste. Despite common myths, goldfish do not ""grow to the size of their container,"" and rather are stunted due to poor diet and water quality. Your goldfish can easily outgrow their small tank on a high protein diet. Lots of protein in the diet leads to additional ammonia production, which can seriously impact your aquarium or pond's nitrogen cycle. Goldfish should start in an aquarium of at least 20 gallons, but will likely need more room as they grow.</p><p>It is also critical to count the number of protein sources in an ingredient list on the food label. This may take some extra research on your part, but higher quality diets will have fewer protein sources. Fish require from their diet ten essential amino acids (arginine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan and valine) in order to live. This may take just a few protein sources to supply, usually from fish or shrimp meal, or if other protein sources are used, some amino acids may need to be supplemented. If you see any amino acids listed by their pure form, usually ""L-"" or ""DL-,"" this indicates the usage of cheap protein sources. There is nothing wrong with these diets, just don't shell out top dollar for lower quality protein in the food.</p><h3>Fat </h3><p>Unless your fish is a growing juvenile or an adult actively making baby fishes, they do not have a high fat requirement. Rapidly growing fish use oils over protein or carbohydrates as their primary energy source. The fat in the diet should be supplied by unsaturated fats, usually fish oil. Anything higher than 5-8% fat in the food is not necessary for adult goldfish and significantly higher levels can impact liver function.</p><h3>Fiber </h3><p>Fiber is the carbohydrate portion of the fish food. Fish do not utilize much carbohydrate in their natural diet. A goldfish's digestive system is not acidic like ours, so their ability to digest fiber is extremely limited. High fiber is of no benefit to your fish and should be avoided. Usual amounts of fiber in the fish food should be no more than 20-30%.</p><h2>How Often Should I Feed My Goldfish? </h2><p>How often you feed your goldfish is dictated by your aquarium water temperature. Most goldfish aquariums will hover around 72-76 degrees Fahrenheit (22-24C) in a typical home, unless you live in a colder area, or use an aquarium heater in your tank. Goldfish do NOT require a heater and too warm of water temperature may excessively increase metabolism. Ideal water temperature for goldfish is 68-75 F (20-24 C), but they can live in a wider temperature range than that.</p><p>General guidelines for goldfish feedings per day are relatively flexible. In the lower 70s and down into the 60s (less than 23 Celsius), feed your goldfish once per day. Above this, you should feed twice a day. Do not feed more than your fish can eat in a few minutes. Sprinkle very small amounts and once that has been completely consumed, sprinkle a little more for up to 3-5 minutes at each feeding.</p><h2>How Do I Know If My Goldfish is Overfed? </h2><p>Goldfish are prone to obesity like many other pets. However, an overfed goldfish can be hard to differentiate. Body condition scoring is a common method of determining if a pet is overweight. While there are good standards for other fish, such as zebrafish, there is no set standard for goldfish.</p><p>Using the zebrafish research, a simple goldfish obesity test can be applied. Looking down at your goldfish, their head and pectoral girdle should be the widest part of their body and then taper gradually to the tail. If your goldfish gets wider right behind their pectoral fins, they may be overweight. However, this may be normal for a reproductively active female goldfish. Fat vs. eggs can be easily determined on ultrasound. Also, round bodied goldfish varieties always look fat in the middle!</p><h2>What Can Happen If Your Overfeed Your Goldfish </h2><p>If you overfeed your goldfish, they are at risk for obesity, may quickly outgrow their aquarium and it will create water quality issues. Obesity causes strain on internal organs, as it does in other pets. Thankfully, fish have to continuously swim, decreasing the risk, but it is still a concern.</p><p>As stated previously, overfeeding can quickly increase the size of your fish and cause them to need tank upgrades relatively quickly. This can also lead to an increase in ammonia output and strain your beneficial bacteria in the biofilter that manage the nitrogen cycle. And high ammonia can lead to fish health issues and death.</p>",1262

In European countries, people may turn to an eel-like fish to predict storms. Amazingly, our weather experts might be given a run for their money when pitted against the meteorologically gifted fish.</p><p>When storms approach, the previously calm weather loach begins swimming wildly about, appearing to be looking for a way out. It's believed that changes in the barometric pressure, particularly low pressures that often occur just before storms, account for the wild behavior.</p><p>Anyone who owns a weather loach can testify that predicting the weather isn't the only reason to keep one. Their active and interesting personalities coupled with ease of care have made them one of the most popular loaches. </p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Weather loaches are native to Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Northern Vietnam, Sakhalin Island, and Siberia. However, they have been introduced into locations across the world, and wild populations can now be found in Germany, Italy, Kazakhstan, the Philippines, Spain, Turkmenistan, the U.S., and Uzbekistan. This ever-widening distribution is due to several factors, including aquarium releases and farms where the fish are raised as a food source and for use as angling bait.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Often mistaken for an eel, the weather loach has an elongated olive-colored body that is either striped from head to tail (as seen in , rarely seen in the United States and Western Europe), or sprinkled with many spots, as seen in .</p><p>Six sensitive barbels surround the mouth of the weather loach, giving it the appearance of being a living dust mop. Among the largest of the freshwater loaches, there are reports of weather loaches reaching 20 inches in length. The average weather loach kept in aquariums reaches five to eight inches in length. Its hardy nature makes it a beginner's dream fish. In fact, it's almost impossible to kill. Many owners can relate stories of their loach jumping from the tank and surviving overnight without any ill effects.</p><p>Although not extremely colorful, they have very expressive mannerisms. It is not unusual to see a weather loach resting on its pectoral fins as if they were arms, intently following your movements with its eyes. Some owners report that their weather loach likes to be touched and even petted. However, it is wise to always keep the tank well-covered to ensure they don't make a break for it.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Weather loaches are peaceful and may be kept with virtually any other peaceful fish. They need not be kept in a school but will tolerate others of their own kind. Keep in mind that they will quickly gobble up eggs, and should not be kept in a tank with breeding fish.</p><h2>Weather Loach Habitat and Care </h2><p>The ability of the weather loach to thrive in less than optimal situations dates back to its natural habitat in China and Japan. There they live in shallow rivers, paddies, and even in ditches. Because they possess the ability to use their intestine to derive oxygen from the air, they can survive when oxygen levels drop very low.</p><p>During dry spells when water sources disappear, the industrious weather loach survives by burrowing in the mud to protect its skin from drying out. This burrowing habit is a favorite pastime, and it's not unusual for an owner to think the fish has disappeared only to discover the loach burrowed beneath the substrate. If burrowing does not offer sufficient protection during particularly severe conditions, the weather loach is capable of secreting a protective mucus to prevent it from drying out.</p><p>Although this species is adaptable to almost any conditions, colder water is preferable. The weather loach enjoys hiding places such as rocks and other landscaping materials, or even something as simple as a plastic tube left in the tank. Take care to keep filter inlet tubes well covered, as they will not hesitate to swim up an uncovered tube. It is not unusual for owners to report having found their loach inside the filter.</p><p>Because the weather loach sifts through the substrate quite vigorously, it will often uproot plants that are not well-rooted. Potted plants are a good option. The substrate should be fairly fine to prevent the loach from damaging itself when it roots for food or buries itself in the substrate. Sand or fine grain gravel are good choices for the substrate. Lighting should be subdued, or plenty of covers provided so shady hiding spots can be found.</p><h2>Weather Loach Diet </h2><p>Weather loaches are great vacuum cleaners, sucking up virtually anything that falls to the bottom of the tank and spitting out what it doesn't care They are particularly fond of fish eggs, so keep that in mind if you are thinking of breeding egg-laying fish in the same tank. In the wild, their diet consists of insect larvae, small crustaceans and molluscs, and detritus. However, they will also readily eat fresh vegetables. Peas are a prized delicacy but should be skinned before being placed in the tank.</p><p>Their ability to adapt their diet has made them a subject of some concern because of the impact they could have on the aquatic insect population should the numbers of weather loaches in the wild increase. As a result of aquarium releases, weather loaches have been found living in the wild in California, Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Michigan, and Tennessee. In some cases, the releases occurred when fishermen used weather loaches as bait. Other releases may have occurred as far back as the 1800s when they were used as a source of food.</p><p>The United States is not the only part of the world where weather loaches have been served at the dinner table. They are sold live in open markets throughout Korea, where they are often used to make a very tasty soup. It is said the soup promotes good health.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Females are generally a bit larger and fuller-bodied than males. Adult males have enlarged pectoral fins and may also have swellings behind the dorsal fin, which can be seen when viewed from above.</p><h2>Breeding the Weather Loach </h2><p>Breeding is fairly difficult, primarily due to a lack of knowledge about their spawning habits. They are a cold-water fish and require several months of cold temperatures to induce spawning. Spawning occurs in the spring to early summer, before water temperatures become too warm.</p><p>They may be sexed based on the pectoral fins, which are larger in males than in females. Spawning follows a courtship ritual that includes sinuous movements back and forth by the breeding pair, sometimes lasting for a period of several hours. The fertilized eggs hatch in approximately three days. For the first week, the fry feed on infusoria, after which they may be fed freshly-hatched brine shrimp.</p>",1116

The Wagtail Platy is not only one of the most beautiful of all Platys, but it is available in several color varieties and it breeds true to color and to the tail and fin blackness as well. One would think this fish to be a well-established species in nature with a proper name, classification and place of origin in the world. Well, sometimes nothing is stranger than the truth.</p><p>Aquarists are no different than other hobbyists in most respects. In general, they have the typical attitude that uncommon things are the most desirable because these unusual things bring friendly attention to them and their standing with others in the hobby.</p><p>For this reason, a number of substantial tropical fish importing firms spent years and millions of dollars on expeditions to the far reaches of the Upper Amazon and the interior of equatorial Africa and Southeast Asia to secure exotic fish that could be bred and distributed from Florida fish farms to hobbyists around the world.</p><h2>The Origin of the Wagtail Platy </h2><p>Even though each country has beautiful fish in its own right America, for example, has the Sun Fish, popular in Europe as an aquarium fish but cooked in a pan on US camping trips aquarium hobbyists insist upon the exotic, the colorful and the unusual. One notable exception is a little fish that does not exist in the wild anywhere in the world and never did. The Wagtail Platy was created by accident in the New York City laboratory of a distinguished biologist.</p><p>The late Dr. Myron Gordon was a widely acclaimed authority on the inheritance of cancer. Much of his experimental work was done with different types of the Platy, which are native to Central America. Dr. Gordon made a number of trips to Central American countries in search of fish that had tumors or at least looked to him as though they might produce tumors.</p><p>One group of native Platys brought back to the laboratory by Dr. Gordon had black edges on the top and bottom of their tail fins. He called them Comet Platy. Do not look for the Comet Platy, they may still exist in nature, but they were not registered and Dr. Gordon did not receive scientific credit for either the discovery or the naming if this unique but presumably unattractive little fish.</p><p>Now here is where the history takes an even stranger turn. Writing in 'The Aquarium Magazine', August 1940, Dr. Gordon said, ""When first we discovered the 'Comet' Platy in Mexico, we thought we had just another genetic variety of the platyfish's great natural stock of patterns. While the black-margined tail of the 'Comet' was of interest to me in the study of fish genetics, the tropical fish dealer could not see any commercial success for it; and I confess, neither did I.""</p><p>However, when the biologist crossed his 'Comet' Platy with some of the varieties in his laboratory, he was amazed. The babies produced had jet black fins and lips with a scattering of black on the body. Here was a variety that would appeal to the aquarium hobbyist, which he named the Wagtail Platy. The name stuck with the fish through many variations over the years, but Dr. Gordon's credit is long forgotten.</p><h2>Strain Further Refined By Breeders and Commercial Fish Farms </h2><p>By careful selection, the strain was further refined by breeders at commercial fish farms over the years until the black on the bodies was largely eliminated. Wagtails were crossed with the Golden Platy and the Red Platy, producing the Gold Wagtails and Red Wagtails we see in most every tropical fish store to this day.</p><p>Geneticists now know that the wagtail pattern is caused by a genetic phenomenon similar to one that causes Siamese cats and Himalayan rabbits to have dark coloring on all of their extremities. To Dr. Gordon, the Wagtail Platy was another tool to use in his research, but fortunately, he shared his discovery with aquarists. Today the Wagtail Platy can be purchased in virtually every store in the world that sells tropical fish. They are nearly as common as guppies.</p><p>If you want a fish that is even tempered, fun to watch, exotic in color and easy to keep in a community aquarium, look no farther than the Wagtail Platy. But remember, behind every fish you keep there is a history, and knowing a little bit if its history makes it that much more fun to be a part of this wonderful hobby of fish keeping.</p>",773
119,https://www.thesprucepets.com/velvet-in-aquarium-fish-5248622,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Velvet: Aquarium Fish Disease Identification and Cure</h1>,"<h1>Velvet: Aquarium Fish Disease Identification and Cure</h1><p>Velvet disease in fish is caused by the dinoflagellate parasites in freshwater fish and in saltwater fish. These two parasites have identical clinical signs and presentation, but they have very different treatments. Also known as ""rust"" or ""gold dust"" disease, this parasite infestation can very quickly kill your fish if not diagnosed and treated correctly and quickly.</p><h3>Signs of Velvet in Aquarium Fish</h3><p>The classic clinical presentation of velvet is that your fish appear to be dusted with a fine yellow or pale powder. Other signs include respiratory distress, increased respiratory effort/rate, lethargy, and sudden death.</p><h2>Causes of Velvet in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>The most common cause of any parasite infestation in an aquarium is an incomplete quarantine protocol. If fish are not properly quarantined once they come home from the pet store for four to six weeks, there is an increased risk of the new fish bringing in infectious diseases, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites.</p><p>Most fish move through a vendor so quickly that they may not show any clinical signs of disease until a few days to weeks after you bring them home. Rather than having them get your entire tank of fish sick, by keeping them isolated in a quarantine tank you can treat a smaller volume of water and significantly fewer fish. Treating the new fish in a quarantine tank also decreases the risk of the death of your fish.</p><p>The life cycle of velvet is almost identical to that of white spot disease or ich. This is significant because both parasites go through encysted life stages, called trophont (feeding) or tomont (reproducing) stages, that are resistant to almost all treatments. Only the dinospore (free-swimming) stage is susceptible to medication. With this life cycle, proper treatment duration and repetition is key. All it takes is one rogue trophont or tomont brought in on a new fish to infect your entire aquarium very quickly.</p><h2>Diagnosis of Velvet in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>The correct way to make a diagnosis of velvet is performed by your aquatic veterinarian during your fish's physical exam. Small dots on your fish's body can be easily confused for fin ray fractures, lymphocystis, or white spot disease. As part of your fish's exam, a small gill and skin biopsy sample will be taken for microscopic evaluation. Under low magnification, your veterinarian can easily identify the parasite responsible for making your fish sick and prescribe an effective treatment.</p><p>Although two different genera are responsible for velvet, the diagnosis and clinical signs are the same for marine and freshwater fish. However, your freshwater fish cannot be infected by marine velvet and vice versa.</p><h2>Treatment of Velvet in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>Once a definitive diagnosis has been made, it is critical to start treatment immediately in order to save the lives of your fish. Again, because of its life cycle stages, your treatment will only target the dinospore stage. You must wait for the trophonts and tomonts to develop to this stage in order to completely eradicate this infestation. Timing and duration of treatments must be carefully planned with your veterinarian taking into account your tank's temperature in order to successfully treat your fish.</p><p>The best treatment for velvet in marine fish is copper. There are commercial fish medications available that contain copper formulations. Follow the label directions carefully. Other treatments, such as freshwater dips for three to five minutes, and commercial fish medications containing formalin or hydrogen peroxide, are sometimes effective, especially when fish are moved into a clean aquarium.</p><p>For freshwater velvet, increasing the water temperature and turning off the lighting will help reduce the growth of . The safest and most effective method is a salt-immersion treatment (salt water dip). Commercial copper medications can also be used, but beware of their effects on alkalinity and pH. Follow medication label directions carefully.</p><p>A final note on treatment is to ensure your aquarium is at the correct temperature and has proper water quality. No medication will cure your fish when the water is bad. Remove all activated carbon from filtration when medicating; it will remove the medicine from the water.</p><h2>How to Prevent Velvet in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>In order to protect your fish against velvet, it is critical to have effective quarantine protocols in place for all incoming fish, invertebrates, and plants. All new additions should be quarantined for four to six weeks in an isolated aquarium under careful observation. There is no pet store that can guarantee your fish are healthy because they do not stay more than a few days in their facility. It can take several days to weeks, depending on your water temperature, for clinical signs of disease to develop.</p><p>Don't risk the lives of all your fish! Properly quarantine all new potential tank additions, and it will save you stress, money, and the lives of your fish.</p>",794

Grouped together with their close cousins, the swordtails, platys are part of the genus known as . They are hardy, compatible with other fish, and are extremely easy to breed. They also come in a variety of attractive colors and forms. </p><p>Although platys comprise only a couple of species within the genus, there are considerable variations in color and even fin type within these species. Furthermore, the species interbreed so readily that many specimens sold in the trade are mixed hybrids. However, they all do well in similar conditions, so unless your goal is to breed a pure line, this doesn't really matter. Choose your variety based on whatever appearance you like. </p><h2>Color Variations </h2><p>Mark Dumont/Flickr/CC By 2.0</p><p>Platys are one of the more colorful freshwater fish, with base colors that range from pale yellows all the way to deep black and many shades in between. As with many fish species, there is also an albino variant. Within each of the color groups, there are many shades, along with a number of names used to describe them. It is common for platys to exhibit several colors as well as various shades all in the same fish.</p><h2>Wagtail Pattern </h2><p>When the rays of the caudal and dorsal fins are black, the pattern is said to be a wagtail. Wagtails can occur with virtually any body color and can be combined with other color patterns. For instance, the painted or variegated pattern may be combined with the wagtail trait. Red or gold are the most commonly seen colors of wagtails, but the variation can also exhibit blue, gold, or green colors. The wagtail color pattern is also frequently seen in another species within the genus, the swordtails.</p><h2>Variegated Pattern </h2><p>Dark splotches of various sizes and shapes all over the body is a common color pattern. Usually called the variegated pattern, it's also referred to as , as it resembles the dabbling of an artist's brush. Variegated patterns may be combined with any base color, as well as with other color patterns or tail variations. The highly popular Mickey Mouse platy is a type of variegated color pattern.</p><h2>Salt-and-Pepper Pattern </h2><p>In this slightly different twist on the variegated pattern, there are a number of dark or light spots (rather than blotches) that are liberally sprinkled over the body. As with other color patterns, the salt-and-pepper type may be combined with several different color and fin variations.</p><h2>Tuxedo Pattern </h2><p>The tuxedo variation refers to a dual pattern in which the posterior portion of the fish is black while the anterior portion is another color. Red and gold are commonly seen colors in tuxedo patterns and the combination can be extremely attractive. As with other types of color patterns, the tuxedo trait is often combined with additional color variations, such as the comet or twin bar pattern.</p><h2>Rainbow Pattern </h2><p>A number of colors in a single fish is known as a rainbow color variation. Often these fish display colors in true rainbow fashion, ranging from dark to lighter colors, ending with a black tail. An attractive iridescent rainbow color pattern is also available, sold under the name .</p><h2>Comet or Twin Bar Pattern </h2><p>The comet or twin bar trait is another color variation that is often combined with other color patterns. In this variation, the caudal fin is edged in black on both of the outside margins. The twin black bars makes the tail fin stand out noticeably.</p><h2>Hifin Variation </h2><p>There are two common fin variations in platys the is the most frequently seen trait. In hifins, the dorsal fin is elongated, sometimes quite significantly. As with other traits, the hifin variation can be found in fish with a variety of different color patterns.</p><p>Unfortunately, any tail variation in which all or part of the tail is elongated lends itself to being nipped. Elongated fins are also more prone to disease when the fish is stressed, or if the water conditions are not optimal. Owners of fish with these variations should monitor their health closely and address problems quickly.</p><h2>Pintail Variation </h2><p>non</p><p>Seen less often than the hifin, this variation is easily spotted. In the pintail, the center portion of the tail fin is elongated, jutting out like a pin. Sometimes the fish is mistaken for a swordtail, which is actually a different species within the same genus. </p>",734
107,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ulcers-in-freshwater-fish-4802382,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Ulcers in Freshwater Fish</h1>,"<h1>Ulcers in Freshwater Fish</h1><p>Ulcers in freshwater fish are a common problem, but they are usually not the only problem you may have at the time. Ulcers most commonly occur when a fish's defenses are weakened by a primary stressor, such as a parasite damaging the skin and allowing bacteria to enter. Severe ulcers may require veterinary care, but basic ones are easily treated by checking a few key items.</p><h2>What Are ""Ulcers?"" </h2><p>Ulcers are defined as a sore through the skin, resulting in tissue necrosis. They can have many inciting factors that start the injury, such as trauma or parasites. Severe ulcers may lead to exposure of underlying musculature. An ulcer on the abdomen can expose internal organs. Deeper ulcers are more likely to result in death of the fish.</p><p>Due to the nature of aquariums, bacteria are always present in the water and may occur on fish's skin. Most of the time, the mucus layer on the body and a fish's immune system will keep the bacterial invaders from penetrating the outer skin layers. Fish skin mucus is full of immune factors, which is why it is important to keep it on the fish. Water conditioners that contain polyvinylpyrilodone (PVP) may improve the slime coat, and do promote wound healing.</p><p>If a fish's immune system is overwhelmed by the bacterial onslaught or you encounter a particularly nasty bacteria strain, your fish are likely to develop ulcers. Although they may start on the surface, once bacteria has breached the outer wall, your fish may be susceptible to a full systemic infection or sepsis.</p><h3>Signs of Ulcers in Freshwater Fish</h3><h2>Causes of Ulcers in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>Primary infections in fish by ulcerating bacteria are rare. Often, a common bacteria species will take advantage of a drop in your fish's immune defenses. An acute stress reaction is beneficial for fish, and is associated with the ""fight or flight"" response. If a stressor cannot be escaped or mitigated, this results in a chronic stressor. Chronic stress results in decreased immune function, decreased fecundity and decreased body condition.</p><h3>Poor Water Quality</h3><p>The quality of water that the fish swim in is directly correlated to their overall health. Not maintaining your filtration system and ignoring improper water quality will result in many secondary diseases, ulcers included. Also, fish kept at cooler water temperature will have a weaker immune system.</p><h3>Parasites </h3><p>Freshwater fish parasites can stress fish and create skin damage that allows for bacteria to penetrate into the skin. Parasites on the skin will often cause the fish to ""flash."" Flashing is a behavior in which fish use their substrate and any décor to scratch themselves, exposing the brighter belly that looks like a flash of light. This behavior may look like a ""twitchy dance"" or ""uncoordinated swimming."" Parasites will often enter an aquarium when new fish are added without quarantine.</p><p>Keep in mind that your aquarium water temperature will determine how fast parasites complete their life cycle. Treatments for eliminating parasites must be used long enough to completely disrupt the parasite's life cycle. This is critical in outdoor ponds with varying seasonal temperatures.</p><h3>Poor Nutrition </h3><p>In order to give your fish the best nutrition, don't just reach for whatever food container is most expensive. Do your research so you know what diet is best for your fish. Is it a herbivore, carnivore, or omnivore? Select the right food for your species of fish. Poor or inadequate nutrition will decrease your fish's immune function. Providing a variety of foods to your fish will decrease the risk of nutritional deficiencies that might occur from feeding the same food all the time.</p><p>Don't keep any food for more than 6 months; after this point, it has started to lose too much of its vitamin content. Keep your food in a sealed, light-proof container in a pantry or cupboard. For pond fish, keep the food inside where the temperature is stable. You can even keep the food in the refrigerator or freezer where is will maintain freshness longer.</p><h3>Aggression</h3><p>Fish can become aggressive over food, territory and reproductive opportunities. Aggressive behavior can include charging, nipping, ramming and chasing. The stress of an attack can be enough to stress out more docile species. Open wounds from attacks in addition to stress can create an ideal environment for bacterial ulcers to form.</p><h2>Treatment of Ulcers in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>Once a primary stressor has been identified and removed, your fish will most likely heal without any additional intervention if it is a minor wound and water conditions are perfect.</p><p>Severe ulcers will require veterinary treatment, often with antibiotic therapy. Your veterinarian may recommend a bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity test to identify the primary bacteria of concern and a list of antibiotics it is most susceptible to. Your veterinarian may even give the fish an injection of antibiotics, or prescribe a fish food that contains antibiotics.</p><p>Do not attempt to treat your fishes' ulcers with over-the-counter antibiotics. These illegal products are not checked for potency and efficacy. Using a dose that is not high enough to kill the bacteria can even result in antibiotic resistance in the bacteria. Water-based antibiotic treatments will also wipe out your biologic filter and cause additional stress.</p><h2>How to Prevent Ulcers in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>In order to prevent ulcers in fish, it is critical to mitigate stress in your aquarium.</p>",906
98,https://www.thesprucepets.com/tumors-in-pet-fish-5094497,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Tumors in Pet Fish</h1>,"<h1>Tumors in Pet Fish</h1><p>John Smith/Flickr</p><p>Unfortunately, fish are not immune to cancerous tumors. They can arise from many different tissues and may cause a broad array of health conditions. It is critical that all growths or tumors seen on your fish are diagnosed by a qualified veterinarian as soon as they are first noticed. Waiting on treatment can seriously impact the prognosis of your pet fish.</p><h2>Causes of Tumors in Pet Fish </h2><p>A tumor is an abnormal swelling or bump in the body tissues. Tumors can be benign, meaning that they do not spread but grow in a single location, or malignant, meaning they may spread to other tissues throughout the body. Cancer, which is Latin for crab, is the term used to describe malignant tumors that spread throughout the surrounding tissues, extending into healthy tissues like the legs of a crab. All tumors occur when cell division goes awry. Instead of the cell's natural defense mechanism terminating the rogue cell, the abnormal cell is allowed to replicate. Multiple replications cause a tumor to form. The rate of tumor growth depends on the type of cell and its access to nutrients.</p><p>Tumors can occur in all tissue types, but fish are more prone to developing tumors in their skin and reproductive organs. There are also viruses that can present abnormal growths similarly to tumors that need to be considered.</p><h2>Examples of Types of Tumors in Pet Fish </h2><h3>Neurofibroma </h3><p>Neurofibromas are most commonly associated with goldfish. These nerve sheath tumors cause localized skin and fin lumps that can grow very large, fall off, and then regrow.</p><p>They are benign tumors and do not cause the fish any distress other than temporary hydrodynamic resistance, increasing their drag while swimming. These tumors penetrate deeply into the skin tissues and can have extensive vascularization, impacting on blood flow. Surgical removal under anesthesia is often curative. Treatment with medications is not recommended due to limited success.</p><h3>Chromatophoroma </h3><p>These pigment cell tumors are seen in koi, butterfly fish and catfish species. They can arise from any type of pigment cell, each with its own unique name. For example, melanophoromas arise from the black melanin-containing cells called melanophores and iridophoromas arise from crystalized or sparkling pigment cells called iridophores.</p><p>In koi, chromatophoromas often occur on the dorsal surface of the skin and conjunctiva. These are more common in ponds that are exposed to lots of sunlight. Mild cases have been successfully treated with cryotherapy or the application of liquid nitrogen.</p><h3>Gonadal sarcoma </h3><p>This is a common type of reproductive tumor, especially in koi where it is often mistaken for ""egg binding."" It is more common in older female koi and can be very hard to see externally. There may be signs of the body swelling, scales protruding or abnormal swimming in the affected fish.</p><p>It is usually only after the tumor is sufficiently large that the owner notices a change in their fish's appearance. If caught early enough, making a diagnosis using radiology or using ultrasound, a fish can undergo surgery to remove the tumor. If not, the tumor will continue to grow and eventually interfere with the normal organ functions.</p><h2>Diagnostic Processes </h2><p>Depending on the location of the tumor, your veterinarian can use multiple diagnostic techniques to determine its source and best treatment. For external tumors, a simple biopsy or cytological sample is used, collecting a few cells of the tumor. These samples will be processed and sent to a specialized laboratory for further analysis. Sometimes, surgical excision is used to remove the tumor for both diagnostic testing as well as treatment.</p><p>For suspected internal tumors, your veterinarian may utilize ultrasound or radiographs to examine the internal structures of your fish. Radiographs are best for observing bones and swim bladder structure, but when used with contrast media, such as barium, the entire GI tract can be visualized. Ultrasound is used to observe the structure of soft tissue components, such as internal organs.</p><p>Both radiographs and ultrasound, as well as biopsy/cytology, may be utilized to determine the effects of the tumor on your fish's health.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Depending on the type of tumor, there are a variety of treatment options. Traditional cancer therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy , have not been utilized much due to limited access and owner's concerns for cost.</p><p>External tumors are frequently treated with surgical excision and with secondary topical treatment, such as cryotherapy. With this treatment, your veterinarian will anesthetize your fish, apply a local anesthetic, surgically cut away the mass, and apply liquid nitrogen to the spot to deter further cell growth.</p><p>Internal tumors will require surgery. Yes, fish can undergo surgery, just like other animals. Although the procedure is slightly altered, many fish have undergone successful surgical treatment for various types of internal tumors. The fish is anesthetized and removed from the water, keeping it wet with moistened gauze placed on its skin. A water pump flushes anesthesia solution through the fish's mouth and across its gills to keep it oxygenated and anesthetized. Under these conditions, a fish can be removed from the water for 30-60 minutes while surgery is performed to remove an internal tumor. After suturing the incision, the fish is returned to clean water where it will gradually awaken from the anesthesia.</p><h2>How to Prevent Tumors in Pet Fish </h2><p>There is a suspected genetic predisposition to certain cancer types. Fish bred for certain external appearances, such as koi with large bellies and moor goldfish with large eyes, may be unknowingly selecting for potential tumors.</p><p>Currently, we don't know enough about tumors in pet fish to give owners a specific list of prevention strategies. Proper water quality and good nutrition go a long way in preventing diseases in fish. The best recommendation is to evaluate all your fishes daily, and if one starts to look or act odd, contact your aquatic veterinarian as soon as possible to ensure your fish have a long and healthy life.</p>",1023
164,https://www.thesprucepets.com/tigertail-seahorse-hippocampus-comes-2925477,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Tigertail Seahorse</h1>,"<h1>Tigertail Seahorse</h1><h2>A Unique Addition to Your Tank</h2><p>Seahorses in pairs or groups can be an exciting addition to a saltwater aquarium. The Tigertail Seahorse species is relatively common in the aquarium trade. Even better, Tigertails are easy to breed and will do well and regularly reproduce if they're offered a proper diet regularly and are provided safety from even perceived predation.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Tigertail Seahorse</p><p>Adult Size: About 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 1 1/2 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Tigertail Seahorse comes from the Western Central Pacific. It is found off the shores of Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, and the Philippines. They generally travel in pairs, often in sponge gardens and floating seaweed gardens such as kelp and sargassum. Their habitat, subtidal aquatic beds and coral reefs, is threatened by climate change. Seahorses are also collected in large quantities for use in Chinese herbal medicine.  </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Tigertail Seahorses are long black and yellow fish with long snouts, prehensile tails, and 16 19 pectoral fins. Their coloring may vary by gender, with males being blacker and females being yellower. They wear a bony ""coronet"" of five rounded spines and have spines on their cheeks and noses. They have alternating tiger-striped rings from their bellies to the tips of their tails. Instead of scales, they have thick skin over boney rings. Their coloring and their physiology both help protect them from predators.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>As with most Seahorses, the Tigertail Seahorse does best in a quiet tank with little competition for food. Less aggressive fish such as Pipefish and Mandarinfish make good tankmates. Avoid aggressive species such as blennies, gobies, wrasses, triggerfish, and porcupinefish. Seahorses are monogamous; the Tigertail Seahorse does best in pairs or small groups in an aquarium.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>Seahorses require stationary perches to wrap their prehensile tails around. Perches can be artificial or real; gorgonians and plastic plants are both excellent options. Since Seahorses are not strong swimmers, they do best in a tank with low water flow. Seahorses prefer a tall tank in captivity. The DIY Seahorse Tank works very well for Seahorses. Transiting the entire tank during the day, they can be found on the surface of the water as well as examining the substrate for potential food.</p><h2>Diet  </h2><p>The Tigertail Seahorse is a consummate carnivore in the wild, where they feed upon amphipods and other small crustaceans found in live rock. Seahorses should be fed live or (if they will take it) vitamin enriched frozen or freeze-dried Mysis Shrimp. Seahorses should be fed several times per day with food available for 20 to 30 minutes per feeding.</p><p>Wild-caught Seahorses may be slow to accept frozen or freeze-dried mysid shrimp as food, to begin with, and may have to be fed live foods until they are weaned onto prepared foods. Tank-raised Seahorses (greatly preferred to wild-caught) are typically trained to accept frozen or freeze-dried mysid shrimp at an early age and will make the transition to your tank much more easily than wild-caught.</p><p>The Tigertail Seahorse is not an aggressive feeder. This fish will closely examine every piece of potential food before consuming it. If tanked with more aggressive feeders, the Tigertail (in fact, almost every Seahorse) will starve to death overtime.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Males are often blackish, while females are usually yellowish. The male carries the eggs in a brood pouch located under the tail.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>The mating ritual of the Tigertail Seahorse is quite fascinating. When the male is ready to mate, he will present the female with a dance, color changes, blatant pouch displays, and active gyrations. If the female is receptive, she will entwine tails with the male, dance, and promenade with it, and then insert as many as 500 to 600 eggs in the male pouch. About two weeks later, the male gives birth to between 50 and 400 miniature duplicates of the pair.</p><p>Once ""born,"" the miniature Tigertail Seahorses no longer depend on their parents for food or survival. In the wild, the baby Tigertail Seahorses migrate to the surface of the ocean and merge into the plankton ""soup"" for both food and concealment. While in the plankton, the seahorses feed upon whatever moves and will fit in its mouth. In the wild, the Tigertail Seahorse will not feed upon anything other than live food hence the challenge of weaning the small seahorses off onto hand-fed frozen and freeze-dried foods in captivity.</p><h2>Seahorse Diseases </h2><p>Seahorses are fish and are therefore subject to all or nearly all of the same diseases as other fish. Most Seahorse diseases are either caused or exacerbated by poor water quality in the aquarium.</p>",748

Originally, the Discus was made internationally popular by Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod.</p><p>When Dr. Axelrod first introduced the Discus to the wonderful world of fish keeping, it was impossible for any but the most experienced aquarist to maintain a proper environment to house even one of these beautiful feats of nature, let alone breed a pair. Today, many enjoy whole collections of brightly colored specimens, though special care must still be taken for best results.</p><h2>The Origin and Profile of the Discus </h2><p>The Discus, like the Angelfish (Pterophyllum) and Cichlasoma festivum, inhabit the gigantic region included under the name Amazonas, extending from the middle reaches of the Amazon River too far into the jungles of the Venezuelan and Peruvian flood basins.</p><p>The Discus is quite commonly found there among profuse plant growth in the quiet bends of the rivers, under overhanging banks, and among rock crannies. In the shallow areas, it cares for its young beneath the numerous leaves of various Nymphaea species.</p><p>Ever since the Discus Fish was first introduced to the aquarists in 1933, they created a sensation. For years afterward, the Discus was regarded as the king of the aquarium fish. Even today, many aquarists regard the Discus as the choicest tropical fish available, the most challenging of all freshwater tropical fish to keep and the badge of honor for those few aquarists who are lucky enough to have a Discus or two in their collection.</p><p>It is easy to understand why the mature Discus Fish should be regarded as the most regal of aquarium fish. They swim about with a noble bearing and a touch of shyness. Fully grown, an adult Discus can reach as large as 6 inches end to end, and in good condition, they possess great beauty, both in bearing and coloration.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Can be sexed only by experts; at spawning time the genital papilla is pointed in males, flat and round in females. When viewed from the top at breeding time, females are slightly fatter, due to filling with roe (eggs).</p><h2>Common Behaviour </h2><p>Very peaceful, doesn't burrow in the substrate (dig in the gravel like many cichlids) and does not dig up nor tear up plants. The Discus lives in harmony with other fish, except at spawning time, when they will vigorously defend their young. It is best to get a group of young Discus and let them pair off, a Discus will mate for life; it will be obvious when mates have found each other, and they will no longer hang out with the group, but stake out their own portion of the aquarium, establishing their own territory. Only one pair should be left in any one aquarium if you want successful breeding to commence. Remove the rest of the young to another aquarium, where it is likely another pair may find each other.</p><h2>Water Conditions </h2><p>The Discus needs very pure clear clean water, which is filtered through peat, and in a well established planted aquarium. The temperature should be a steady 82F, pH 6.5  7.5 1  12 dH. For breeding we recommend you read further articles, however in brief; 86F, pH 6  6.5, 0  5 dH.</p><h2>Feeding the Discus </h2><p>The Discus is a finicky eater, it is very important that you give the Discus a diet of live and frozen food. If you do not, they will quickly die on a diet of dry flake food, though it may be offered as a supplement occasionally. Also for rearing fry; you will find that the fry feeds off the parent's sides, yes just as you would image a mammal would feed off its mother, but this means they (both the male and the female) need extra protein.</p><h2>Aquarium Requirements </h2><p>An absolute minimum size aquarium for a Discus is 40 inches long by 20 inches wide and 20 inches tall for young Discus. Adult Discus needs a 5-foot long aquarium or about 75-gallon minimum to be happy and have any chance of breeding successfully. It can possibly happen in a smaller aquarium, it happens all the time, but for maximum success with one of the most finicky fish in freshwater fish keeping, we suggest 75 gallons minimum well planted and well filtered. Discus does not like changes in water conditions, and the larger the body of water, the more gradual the change in water conditions.</p>",760

Check out how fish seem to hold themselves up and thrive in their aquatic atmosphere.</p><h2>How Fish Swim </h2><p>Most fish swim by body movements and fin movements. The fins are mainly balancers, except for the tail fin, which acts as a final thrusting member, propelling the fish through the water.</p><p>In normal, medium-paced to fast swimming, the action is initiated at the head end of the fish, and waves pass down the body, culminating in a flick of the tail. The dorsal and anal fins prevent the fish from turning over in the water; the paired fins also perform braking and turning functions.</p><p>In slow swimming and static balancing in the water, the pectoral fins are used. These fins are usually colorless so that when the fish is still in the water, their gentle movement is unnoticed. Indeed, in a fish like the Siamese fighter , these ""pectoral"" fins must be looked for very carefully, in contrast to the bright colors of the rest of the finnage.</p><p>Some fish, particularly some of the African Cichlids and Sticklebacks, usually swim with the pectoral fins rather than the body, but this is an unusual habit and not the norm.</p><h2>How Fish Balance </h2><p>However, most fish do use the light source as a sense of direction and orientation. This is much the same reaction that causes insects to fly into a light. In the aquarium, the effect of light is seen if the light source entering the tank is not from overhead (an example may be one of the new underwater LED waterproof light tubes). The fish may be observed swimming at an angle, sometimes a very odd sight as they swim in an orientation to the light source as if it were the surface of the aquarium. Continued slanting illumination is said to cause disorders in the fish subject to it, so if you do use submersible lighting for ""effect"" do not use it instead of overhead lighting, but only as a supplement.</p><h2>Metabolic Rate and Oxygen Need </h2><p>The rate at which an animal uses up energy, produces heat and waste products, and consumes oxygen is called the metabolic rate. An understanding of the factors that modify the metabolic rate is of primary importance to the aquarist.</p><p>Since fish are cold-blooded, they differ fundamentally from mammals in that their metabolic rate increases as the temperature rises and are hungriest when warm. Humans consume a great deal of energy, which is supplied by foods and drinks, in order to maintain a constant body temperature that is often well above the temperature of the body's surroundings.</p><p>A fish, on the other hand, doesn't have a warming mechanism to do this but merely obeys a fundamental chemical law which causes the body processes to go faster the higher the body temperature becomes due to the temperature of the water that surrounds the body itself. Thus, a fish turns food into energy at a much higher rate in warm water than in cold water.</p><p>Another factor influencing the metabolic rate is activity. A resting fish needs less energy (food) than an active fish. The higher the temperature, the more energetic a fish tends to be, so that an elevated temperature acts doubly in causing higher energy consumption in most species  the fish is using more energy not only because it is warmer but also because it has to swim more to catch and to consume and digest more food. This action has an upper limit, however, and is probably determined by the lowered solubility of oxygen in warmer waters.</p><p>Thus, at about 80 degrees F, the average fish reaches its maximum oxygen consumption and maximum appetite. This is also the prime temperature to induce breeding activity in most species and to induce the quickest birth cycle in livebearer species.</p><p>A further factor influencing metabolism is age. Young fish are growing relatively faster than older fish, and also they use up oxygen and foodstuffs faster per unit of body weight.<br/></p><p>Remember that female livebearers will need more oxygen than younger fish or males. Keep this in mind as you manage your aquarium.</p><h2>Oxygen Breathing in the Labyrinth Fish </h2><p>The Labyrinth Fish, or Anabantids, are bubble nest builders, but beyond this, they can breathe oxygen directly out of the air by use of the labyrinth organ. Native to warm, stagnant bodies of water, they are able to take in air from the surface of the water and hold it in the Labyrinth Organ. Within the labyrinth are many small maze-like compartments of thin bony plates called lamellae. The lamellae are covered with extremely thin membranes, so thin that oxygen can pass through. Blood within the membranes absorbs the oxygen and carries it throughout the body.</p><p>Their habit of building bubble nests is an adaptation derived from their breathing air. The bubble nest is built from a combination of mucus and air, to form bubbles that float on the surface, and the eggs of the fish are deposited within the nest. </p><p>The male protects the eggs and later the young when they hatch. Now here is the problem for beginning breeders, most Labyrinth Fish species are relatively easy to breed, the fish do all the work, but they lay, and the male hatches out hundreds of fry. </p><p>Once those fry leave the nest, the oxygen requirements are so steep that if the breeder does not have a well-aerated tank, the fry quickly suffocate and die. In nature, the nests are built in swampy streams and ponds and as soon as the fry are free swimming they scatter to the vastness of nature, so they do not remain concentrated in one small space.</p>",948
122,https://www.thesprucepets.com/swim-bladder-disorder-in-aquarium-fish-1381230,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Swim Bladder Disorder in Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Swim Bladder Disorder in Aquarium Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Swim bladder disorder is a condition when the swim bladder isn't working properly due to various possible factors. A swim bladder is a gas-filled internal organ that helps a bony fish maintain its buoyancy. The disorder refers to a collection of issues affecting the swim bladder, rather than a single disease. Although commonly seen in goldfish and bettas, swim bladder disorder can affect virtually any species of fish. The disorder is often treatable, and a fish can experience a full recovery.</p><h2>What Is Swim Bladder Disorder? </h2><p>Swim bladder disorder refers to a condition when the swim bladder does not function normally due to disease, physical abnormalities, mechanical/environmental factors, or for reasons that cannot be diagnosed. Affected fish will exhibit problems with buoyancy, that is, they'll have difficulty controlling their ability to float or sink.</p><h2>Symptoms of Swim Bladder Disorder in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>Sometimes a fish owner may think a fish floating abnormally in the tank is dead but it is actually exhibiting symptoms of swim bladder disorder. Fish suffering from swim bladder disorder exhibit a variety of symptoms that primarily involve buoyancy.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p><br/></p><h3>Sinking/Floating to the Top </h3><p>If the swim bladder is deflated, it will sink in the tank. If the fish has gulped in too much air while feeding, this may cause it to float to the top of the tank.</p><h3>Struggling to Stay Upright </h3><p>A fish that does not have buoyancy problems tends to remain static and upright in the water. If your fish is struggling to stay upright, you will see excessive fin movement that it's using to try to float the right way.</p><h3>Distended Belly </h3><p>Compression of the swim bladder may cause a the fish to swim with a distended stomach. The fish's digestive process may become disrupted with this disorder, which may cause the belly to become enlarged.</p><h3>Curved Back </h3><p>If the fish's abdomen is inflated, other organs are pushed aside which can sometimes cause the spine to curve.</p><h3>Changed Appetite </h3><p>Affected fish may eat normally or have no appetite at all. If severe buoyancy problems exist, the fish may not be able to feed normally or even reach the surface of the water.</p><h2>Causes of Swim Bladder Disorder </h2><h2>Diagnosing Swim Bladder Disorder in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>Typically, swim bladder disorder is diagnosed at home by the observation of symptoms. You can choose to bring your fish to a veterinarian specializing in aquatic conditions. If you do, the only way to properly diagnose swim bladder is with an X-ray. The X-ray will show the swim bladder's size, shape, and location. If there is any fluid or other abnormalities inside of the bladder. An X-ray can also show if there is another growth or disease that is pushing on or displacing the bladder.</p><p>To locate a fish veterinarian near you, contact The American Association of Fish Veterinarians.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment involves water maintenance, feeding changes, and possible antibiotics.</p><h2>Prognosis for Aquarium Fish With Swim Bladder Disorder </h2><p>Sometimes, a swim bladder disorder is only a temporary condition that responds to treatment. Fish with this disorder will have a problem eating, which can be fatal, so you may need to hand-feed your fish if it has significant issues with movement. Unfortunately, many cases of swim bladder disorder do not respond to any type of treatment. If the fish does not recover in a reasonable period of about one or two weeks of treatment, the humane resolution may be euthanasia.</p><h2>How to Prevent Swim Bladder Disorder </h2><h2>Is Swim Bladder Disorder Contagious to Other Fish? </h2><p>A swim bladder disorder is not contagious from fish to fish. However, it's best if you move your ill fish to a separate tank where it can be treated and observed. The tank should be empty of gravel or plants so you can clearly see how the fish is doing. Use fresh water, and do not use water from the tank from which the fish came because the water could have caused the problem.</p>",689

It is a beautiful, colorful fish that looks similar to its close relative the Desjardin's sailfin tang, and is more common and is less expensive.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pacific sailfin tang, eastern sailfin tang, ringed tang, surgeonfish</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 15 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 7 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The sailfin tang is mostly found in seaward reefs and lagoons along the waters of the South Pacific, the Indian Ocean, and Oceania. In the Pacific, these fish are found in places like Indonesia, northern and southern Japan, the Hawaiian Islands, the Tuamoto islands, Rapa Island, southern regions of the Great Barrier Reef, and New Caledonia.</p><p>They can live in waters to a depth of three feet to 200 feet or more. The young ones are solitary by nature and like to spend their time mostly hidden behind rocks, corals, and turbid reefs. They prefer coral areas having strong water currents.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The sailfin tang has a disc-shaped body comprised of a huge anal fin, an elevated dorsal fin, and an extended snout. The pharyngeal teeth are fewer in number and larger in size compared to some of the other species in the Zebrasoma genus. It has scalpels that are sharp spine-like structures located on both sides of the caudal peduncle; these structures serve as defense mechanisms and help the fish to exert domination. The scalpels are folded inside a groove when they are not in use.</p><p>In the juvenile stage, the body is a medium brown color, it has bright yellow stripes with some of the bright yellow color distributed through its fins, tail, and nose. When in the adult stage the body is a brownish-olive color, and the yellow stripes turn a pale yellow with a golden yellow tail.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Like most fish in the surgeonfish family, sailfin tangs are a fish that do not play well with other sailfin tangs. They are very territorial, so if you put two of them together they will fight. Because of the razor or spur by the tail, when they fight they will cut each other up. Do not put more than one in a tank. If a sailfin is in a tank with other surgeonfish, it may get bullied.</p><p>It rarely bothers invertebrates, although the occasional specimen may develop the bad habit of nipping at clam mantles or the polyps of fleshy large-polyp stony corals. They are normally compatible with most other fish.</p><p>In the wild, a cleaner wrasse will help them by taking parasites from their bodies, however, these wrasses are extremely difficult to sustain in captivity. Alternative fish such as neon gobies or cleaner shrimp can help them by providing this cleaning service in the home aquarium.</p><h2>Sailfin Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>A quick and agile swimmer it will spend a good deal of its time in the open water and move in and out of crevices. Frequent water changes are not necessary. You can change 10 percent of the water biweekly or 20 percent once a month.</p><p>All surgeonfish need an aquarium with plenty of aeration, a strong current will help to provide good oxygenation. Provide plenty of space, especially for adult specimens, along with lots of rocks and corals with crevices for retreating and for sleeping. This decor will also lend itself to algae growth which surgeonfish enjoy grazing on, making them a valuable addition to a reef environment.</p><p>Sailfin tangs can be fairly hardy once acclimated but will not do well in a tank that has not completed the aquarium nitrogen cycle. Add a sailfin tang to a tank that has been set up and running for at least six months. Use an aquarium test kit to test the water parameters before introducing the fish to the tank.</p><h2>Sailfin Tang Diet </h2><p>The sailfin tang fish chiefly feed on leafy microalgae, so any tank with sufficient amount of algae makes a very good habitat for this species. Sailfin tangs adapt easily to basic tank foods like flake food, shrimp, sheets of dried kelp, or nori seaweed, just to name a few. They will eat just about anything, but being more of a herbivore, they prefer greens.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>For most of the Zebrasoma species, there are no apparent sexual differences. Males tend to grow a little larger than the females. You may witness some sexual differences, in terms of the mating ritual, but these appear only during the spawning period. </p><h2>Breeding of the Sailfin Tang  </h2><p>Not much is known about the breeding habits of these fishes in the open waters. Sailfin tangs are either male or female and no hermaphroditic characteristics are present. </p><p>Spawning of these fish is closely related to the lunar cycles. The fish breed in pairs. The males perform a color changing spectacle to draw the attention of the females. The males are polygamous and can mate with several females within a single season. On the other hand, the sexually mature females breed only once in a month.</p><p>The fish larvae initially survive on the egg yolk for the first three days. From day four, they start to feed on plankton. As they move on to a more developed stage, their bodies become more compressed and thorns appear on their dorsal as well as their ventral fins. Their bodies develop into being scaleless and transparent. This stage of larvae is called ""acronurus larva"" which is seen only in Acanthuridae family of fish. As they mature, their bodies become oval and round-like and the caudal peduncle becomes more prominent.</p>",914
128,https://www.thesprucepets.com/regal-angelfish-pygoplites-diacanthus-profile-2924136,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Regal Angelfish</h1>,"<h1>Regal Angelfish</h1><h2>Gorgeous Regal Angelfish for Expert Aquarists Only</h2><p>Of all the fish in the ocean, the Regal Angelfish is among the most beautiful. Unfortunately, it is also among the most difficult for a novice aquarist to keep in an aquarium. However, given the proper attention to detail and an environment that caters to the Regal's specific needs, it can thrive in an aquarium for many years.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Regal Angelfish, Royal Angelfish, Empress Angelfish, Blue-Banded Angelfish</p><p>Adult Size: 10 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Regal Angelfish can be found throughout the northern and western Indian Ocean, the Red Sea, and the Indo-Pacific Ocean. The sex of the Regal Angelfish cannot be determined by color variations; however, color differences do exist between specimens from the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean versus those from the Indo-Pacific region. Red Sea and Indian Ocean specimens exhibit a bright orange coloration throughout the ventral area and under the mouth, while those from the Indo-Pacific area are blue-gray. The difference is clear in adult specimens but somewhat harder to discern in juveniles. Juveniles have the same coloration as adults with the exception of a false eye-spot at the base of the dorsal fin. This spot disappears when the juvenile reaches about 3 inches in size.</p><p>In the wild, the Regal Angelfish greatly prefers an area naturally rich in coral growth, both inside and outside the reef, and at depths from knee deep down to 150 feet. This fish greatly prefers to stay near areas with plenty of cracks, crevices, and caves where it can quickly hide from any perceived threat. The smaller the Regal, the closer it stays to concealing cover. The Regal Angel is usually found singly or in mated pairs or small groups with one male and several females.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Most Regal Angelfish have orange and white stripes with blue and black edging. They have yellow tails; their anal and dorsal fins have orange and blue stripes, and the rear part of the dorsal fin is black with blue spots. is adorned with white and orange stripes edged in blues and blacks. There are several other variations in appearance; for example, Regal Angelfish from the Indian Ocean have yellow heads while Pacific varieties have bluish heads, and some have yellow bodies with white stripes. Juveniles look quite different from adults, with an eye spot near their dorsal fins.  </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>A reef-type aquarium is very much preferred by this fish as it provides the rocky reef structure that the fish requires to feel secure. Combining Regal Angelfish with corals is always risky, but they are generally ""safer"" than most other Pomacanthids and even most Centropyge species. If a regal is going to pick on corals, it is usually confined to a particular coral or type of coral. The choice for the aquarist is then between keeping the corals or the fish. Regals generally ignore species but have been reported to pick on certain large-polyped stony corals such as Trachyphyllia or certain soft coral such as Xenia. Regal Angels that are well fed are less likely to venture about the aquarium looking for another food source.</p><h2>Regal Angelfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Regal Angels are definitely not aggressive fish and do not fare well with more aggressive or larger fish in the same tank. Other angelfish become a problem when they outgrow the Regal. Placing two Regals in the same tank usually does not work well even if they are of the opposite sex which it is almost impossible to determine and the smaller one is placed in the tank first.</p><p>When purchasing a Regal Angelfish there are several ""always"" and several ""nevers"" to keep in mind. Always have the seller show you that the Regal is eating in the aquarium (preferably on several occasions) before purchasing. Never buy a Regal on sale. It will normally be subpar and not in good health. Always buy Regal Angels that are caught from either the Red Sea or the Indian Ocean, not the Indo-Pacific as many of these fish are still captured using chemicals and will not survive long. The cost will be more, but the end product will be worth the extra expense.</p><p>It is wise to quarantine a new regal for several weeks before placing it in your show tank. Regals do not adapt easily to tank life and don't really need the added distractions of other fish when they are trying to figure out what is and is not safe to eat. Quarantine the new arrival in a 20-gallon or larger tank (refugiums work well for this) until it is eating hand-fed foods well and shows no signs of disease or parasites.</p><p>Smaller (juveniles of about 2 3 inches) seem to adapt to tank life the easiest. They are too young to be set in their ways but old enough to have survived the threats they have faced.</p><h2>Regal Angelfish Diet </h2><p>In the wild, Regals graze on benthic invertebrates with a particular fondness for sponges and tunicates. In captivity, this fish should be offered a variety of foods to ensure that all of the nutritional requirements are being met. While many aquarists have opinions on the best food to offer the Regal, a varied diet consisting of food such as red nori seaweed, Pro-V gelatin food, Mysis shrimp, and chopped krill has been reported to work very well for this fish. Pro-V is a frozen mix of seaweed and vegetables in a gelatin base. Simply cut a slice of the Pro-V from the sheet and place it in a food clip attached to the side of the tank.</p><p>The Regal Angelfish is not an aggressive feeder and does not fare well when competing with quick-feeding planktivores in a community aquarium. Choosing the proper tankmates for the Regal is imperative to its survival.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>It is almost impossible to tell a male from a female Regal Angelfish, though the females are usually a bit bigger than the males.</p><h2>Breeding of the Regal Angelfish </h2><p>The Regal Angelfish has been reported to spawn at dusk or in the dark of the night. The female performs a spiraling dance as she releases her eggs for fertilization by the male. The eggs float to the surface where they join the other living matter in the plankton ""soup"" in the ocean. As with most other pelagic fish, very few aquarists have reported any success at all with breeding this fish in captivity.</p>",1060

But, compared to other fish, your betta may seem more lethargic or like to sleep more. Is this normal? How can you tell if your fish is sleeping normally or something is actually wrong? Here are some signs you might observe.</p><h2>What is Sleeping in Bettas? </h2><p>All fish, including bettas, sleep. They don't require a soft bed or even eyelids, and most fish don't sleep like you or your fluffy pets. Instead, fish sleep in a state of low metabolism. Most of their brain function is shut down, but they still have the capacity to respond to any immediate threats. A fish's specialized organ for sensing water movement and vibration, the lateral line, is a quick reacting organ that can alert a sleeping fish to any oncoming danger.</p><p>Your fish will sleep when it is dark, so an appropriate photoperiod with light and dark cycles is critical to all indoor tanks. Typically 10-14 hours of light per day is appropriate for tropical fish. If you are unable to turn the lights on in the morning and off at night, an automatic light timer is an important addition to your system. Some lights will even have a morning and evening period where the light slowly changes from dark to light and vice versa. Your light period should match your local light and dark cycles unless you live at a very high latitude.</p><p>When your fish is asleep, they cannot close their eyes since fish do not have eyelids. Eyelids in many terrestrial animals are important in lubricating the eyeball, and when you live underwater, lubrication is all around you. Sleeping fishes may wedge themselves in a crevice or a cave, or if they are a betta, find a calm, flat sleeping spot, such as a leaf or décor item. Bettas really like to sleep in large flat leaves, such as stick-on betta leaf hammocks commonly available at most pet stores. Bettas without leafy décor may find a spot on top of a flat rock or even laying on the bottom of the aquarium substrate.<br/></p><h2>Why Do Bettas Sleep a Lot? </h2><p>In the fish kingdom, bettas fall in the more lazy spectrum, requiring longer rest periods than many other pet fish. Their long, ornate fins take a lot of energy to pull through the water, a feature that many other pet fish do not have. Some fancy varieties of goldfish may also have long fins, and these fish require significantly more energy for swimming than their short finned counterparts, especially if they have stout, compact bodies.</p><p>Imagine trying to swim in a pool wearing a ball gown. It can be a very difficult way to swim, pulling around a lot of material that does not help you swim. This is very similar to a betta fish dragging around a long ornate tail. In order to survive, they take extended rest periods in between meals.</p><p>Temperature is critical to proper fish activity, including metabolism, growth and immune function. Fish of various species have a certain optimal temperature that they function best at. For bettas, this is a tropical temperature around 78-82F (25-28C). Your betta tank will require a heater to keep the water at the best temperature for their activity. If your water is too cold, your betta will be resting more than usual just because they will have a slower metabolism.<br/></p><h2>Signs of Increased Sleeping in Bettas </h2><p>Your betta's activity level can vary widely even within a normal range. It is important that you do not compare your betta to any fish you have owned previously or any fish online. Your betta may only be active during meal times, or may zip around their tank constantly. There is no percentage of swimming vs. sleeping time that is ""normal"" for all bettas.</p><p>It is critical to evaluate your betta's change in swimming vs. sleeping over time. All new fish will likely hide or rest more often than fish that have been in their tanks for awhile. A normal activity adjustment period may take a few days or a few weeks for a new fish to settle in.</p><p>If you are concerned about your fish sleeping more than usual, start a log and take videos to compare to various time periods. Pay close attention to meal times and how your betta responds to food being added to their tank. These notes will be very helpful in determining the cause of your betta's increased sleeping. Monitor your fish's body condition to see if it is gaining weight, which may be a cause of it becoming less active.<br/></p><h2>How to Stop Increased Sleeping </h2><p>If you have logged an increase in your betta's sleeping time, the first thing to check is your water temperature. Remember, bettas need warm water and their aquarium will require a heater. Do not rely on stick on thermometers, but rather use an in-tank thermometer. This will give you the most reliable temperature. Digital thermometers may be more convenient, but do not have the longevity of standard glass thermometers.</p><p>If your betta's water temperature is appropriate, and all the other water parameters are in the normal ranges, it is time to evaluate their diet. If their container of betta food is older than 6 months, the vitamin C content has severely diminished and will require a replacement. You should be feeding your betta two to three times a day and giving enough pellets that would theoretically fit into one of their eyeballs. Supplementation with frozen foods is fine for bettas, provided that most of their diet is pellets with a complete nutritional profile.</p><p>If your betta is getting enough of a high-quality diet and has a warm tank with good water quality, but is still sleeping excessively, it is time to call your aquatic veterinarian. Common betta diseases, including mycobacteria, commonly known as fish tuberculosis, may be causing your fish to be more lethargic and sleep more. The sooner your fish receives veterinary care, the faster the recovery will be.</p>",1020

Most aquarium bacteria are benign, and some are even beneficial for your fish, including those residing in your biological filtration system. Other bacteria, however, wait until your fish's defenses are lowered so they can take advantage of a weak immune system, leading to symptoms such as ragged fins, body ulcers, and loss of appetite.</p><p>It is rare for a bacteria species to cause serious problems in your fish on their own. Usually, they cause a secondary infection after the fish has been weakened by a traumatic injury, transportation stress, or a parasite infestation. However, some species of  are able to cause debilitating disease in otherwise perfectly healthy fish, and can even lead to the fish's death.</p><h2>What Is Pseudomoniasis? </h2><p>Pseudomoniasis is the name of a bacterial infection caused by a species bacteria. It is sometimes called Pseudomonas infection. There are many different species of in the aquatic environment, and the majority are not going to cause your fish any issues. Most aquatic bacteria live on the detritus that collects on the bottom of the aquarium or on the surface of plants and even the aquarium glass. They do not affect the fish unless some other stressor or lesion first weakens the fish's immune system.</p><p>In pseudomoniasis, the fish's weakened immune system permits the bacteria to switch from benign into a harmful source of fish disease.</p><h2>Symptoms of Pseudomoniasis in Fish </h2><p>Pseudomoniasis in fish resembles many other bacterial infections. These generalized signs are not specific to a infection, but are commonly seen with any bacterial fish disease.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Your first indication that something is wrong will likely be spotting red sores on your fish's body, or ragged fins. Often, the sick fish will keep the fins close to its body and may show signs of lethargy, which a fish displays by not moving much, drifting in the lower levels of the aquarium, and loss of appetite. You may notice your fish opening and closing its mouth rapidly. At times, however, the infection will kill the fish before obvious symptoms develop.</p><h2>Causes of Pseudomoniasis </h2><p>species are present in almost all aquatic environments but normally only become pathogenic, meaning capable of causing illness, when a fish becomes debilitated. Once a fish's defenses have been lowered, many pathogens, including bacteria, can spread and flourish. However, there are particular species that can cause disease with little to no prior decrease in immune function.</p><p>One such species is which is a part of the normal fish microbiota. This bacteria species has become highly opportunistic and pathogenic, however, meaning that it is able to infect and sicken even fish that were otherwise healthy. can cause serious fish illnesses including hemorrhagic septicemia, gill necrosis, abdominal distension, and internal organ failure.</p><p>If a fish's immune systems are continually weakened, or the bacteria are too plentiful, your fish will not recover without treatment.</p><h2>Diagnosing Pseudomoniasis in Fish </h2><p>Most fish owners don't take their sick fish to the veterinarian for diagnosis or treatment, though there are vets who specialize in aquatic pets.</p><p>When it comes to pseudomoniasis, the best diagnostic data is obtained from euthanizing a moribund fish (a fish showing severe clinical signs and close to death), and submitting the body to a veterinary lab for bacterial examination. While euthanizing a fish is never pleasant, it can be done quite humanely by immersing the sick fish into a suitably sized container filled with a 1:4 ratio of vodka (or a similar alcohol) and water. For example, if you use 8 ounces of water, you'll add 2 ounces of vodka. The fish will succumb to alcohol poisoning within minutes.</p><p>Tissues collected from the kidneys and spleen provide a great deal of information about what bacteria species is the true causative agent of disease. Then, if there are other fish in the aquarium also suffering from similar symptoms, it will make it easier to treat them with the appropriate antibiotics.</p><p>Additional diagnostics include sampling open wounds for bacterial culture and antibiotic sensitivity testing. However, external wounds are a breeding ground for many different bacteria species, so the results may not be too specific as to the actual cause of the disease.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The best way to treat infections is to identify the primary stressful event that led to the fish's lowered immune function. Common fish stressors include poor water quality, inadequate or incorrect nutrition, or aggression or bullying issues. Possible solutions, depending on the primary issue, may include better aquarium or pond maintenance, removing fish from the environment, purchasing new food, and adding decor items or other environmental improvements.</p><p>Work with your aquatic veterinarian to get advice on how to improve your fish's surroundings to limit stress. If the stressor is not removed, treatments such as correcting poor water quality or antibiotic therapy will only provide temporary relief.</p><p>Your veterinarian can swab the sores on the infected fish's body and send the samples to a lab where they can be cultured to look for the bacteria. Based on the bacteriology results, an antibiotic sensitivity test can be performed to determine the most effective antibiotic for that specific bacteria. This is critical for many species since there is known resistance to multiple antibiotics.</p><p>Once a suitable antibiotic has been identified, your veterinarian will determine the best treatment method. Depending on the size, status, and total number of fish affected, the drug may be given as a bath, in food, or directly injected into the fish.</p><p>Over the counter antibiotic-like products are usually not effective against  species bacteria.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Pseudomoniasis </h2><p>If your fish is only mildly ill and receives treatment for the infection promptly, it is likely to survive. However, fish that are severely ill, or fish not treated with the appropriate antibiotic, are likely to succumb to the infection.</p><h2>How to Prevent Pseudomoniasis </h2><p>The best method to prevent the spread of bacteria in your aquarium is to adhere to strict quarantine protocols. This way, if a fish that is stressed out from capture, transport, and the new environment starts to show clinical signs, it will not spread the disease to the rest of your fish. And maintaining a clean and well-balanced aquarium water system, avoiding overcrowding the tank with too many fish, and feeding a quality diet all help keep your fish healthy enough to fight off infections before they begin.</p><h2>Is Pseudomoniasis Contagious to Humans? </h2><p>Pseudomoniasis is not typically transmissible to humans. Immunocompromised individuals, children, and the elderly should limit their contact with aquarium water, just to be on the safe side, however. The most common fish bacteria with the potential to infect people is fish, which can cause severe skin lesions in humans.</p>",1170

The Powder Brown does best in a large tank with plenty of potential ""houses"" or places to duck into when it feels threatened. Although the similar Goldrim or Whitecheek Tang  is also delicate, it is somewhat more durable.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Powder Brown Tang, Powder Brown Tang, Powder Brown Surgeonfish, Powder Black Surgeon, Japan Surgeonfish, White-nose Surgeonfish, White-Faced Surgeonfish</p><p>Adult Size: 8.3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 7+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Powder Brown Tang has a black dorsal fin; its anal fins are edged in blue; its dorsal fin is edged in red, and it has yellow stripes along its body. Its face is mostly white. With all this color, however, its body is the dark brown color for which it is named. If your Powder Brown Tang suddenly sports a yellow color on the rear part of its body, there's a good chance it has been frightened or startled.</p><p>Powder Brown Tang are similar in appearance to the Whitecheek Surgeonfish , and it is possible that your fish is actually a Whitecheek rather than a Powder Brown as they are often sold under the same name. One difference between the two is the amount of white on their faces (the Whitecheek, oddly, has less white on its face than the ""official"" Powder Brown Tang).  </p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Powder Brown Tangis widely distributed across the Indo-West Pacific; it can be found in the waters of southern Japan, Taiwan; Indonesia, the Philippines, the Hawaiian Islands, and New Caledonia. Its name, refers to the fact that it's often found off the coast of Japan.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Powder Brown Tang is a relatively peaceful Surgeonfish and can be kept in a reef or community tank provided the tank is large enough (they need a great deal of space to move, and can be very messy with their food). This species can be a good tankmate for a wide range of fish or any size, even with smaller semi-aggressive fish; some potential tankmates include Clownfish, Goby, Blenny, Anthias, and Fairy Wrasses. </p><p>There are a few exceptions to this rule: like most Surgeonfish, Powder Brown Tangs can be aggressive toward others of its own genus and are easily stressed by more aggressive fish. Thus, while it's fine to keep your pet with many other fish and marine animals, it's best to keep just a single Surgeonfish in the tank. Be sure to avoid aggressive fish such as Triggers, Lionfish, Puffers, and Grouper.</p><p>Powder Brown Tangs are excellent reef fish, as they graze on algae but will rarely damage coral or attack invertebrates. They can cause some stress to invertebrates, however, as their algae-nibbling can lead to minor damage to coral and clams. These issues can often be handled by ensuring that your tang is fed a plentiful, nutritious diet.</p><h2>Power Brown Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>Powder Brown Tang are caught in the wild and can suffer from a wide range of issues as a result. Stress, parasites, and disease are all possible. It's thus best to select a fish that has been in captivity for a few months and is visibly at ease and eating in its tank. Once you select a Power Brown Tang, you'll need to prepare its environment with care as it's a fragile fish that can be easily stressed.</p><p>Your new pet's tank should be as large as possible (125 gallons is ideal), and it should be a stable environment; a brand new tank is likely to create challenges for your Tang. Provide a sandy substrate, so the Tang can enjoy blowing the sand with their mouths while searching for food. Decorate the tank with nooks, crannies, reef elements, and plants, leaving plenty of open space toward the top of the tank. Choose a high-performing filtration system, and be sure there is a strong water movement to provide excellent oxygenation. Avoid using activated carbon which has been linked to head and Lateral Line Erosion in Tangs.</p><p>It's a good idea to keep the tank at a relatively low temperature (under 78 degrees Fahrenheit), as this serves several functions. First, lower temperatures mean more oxygen for your Tang. Second, Tangs tend to sicken in temperatures between 79 and 83 degrees.</p><p>The ""sword"", ""spur"" or ""scalpel"" at the base of the tail of the Powder Brown Tang is not as large or dangerous as it is with some other Surgeonfish, such as the Naso Tang or the Achilles Tang (Acanthurus achilles) however they are still large enough and sharp enough to inflict a serious wound so be cautious when handling this fish.</p><p>Unlike some of the sturdier Surgeonfish such as the Naso Tang, the Powder Brown is susceptible to gill and fin ammonia burns. Usually caused by excess ammonia accumulation during collection from the ocean or during shipping, ""ammonia burns"" to the gills can be quite serious and eventually fatal in the more serious cases. When purchasing a Powder Brown Tang, have the seller show you that the fish is indeed eating (the first sign of problems with a fish is lack of appetite) and what it is eating.</p><h2>Powder Brown Tang Diet </h2><p>Primarily a herbivore that will graze on filamentous micro and some types of smaller fleshy macroalgae, the Powder Brown should be fed at least 3 times a day on a diet of frozen and dried fares suitable for herbivores that contain marine algae and Spirulina (blue-green algae). Zucchini, broccoli, leaf lettuce, and nori (dried seaweed) can be offered to supplement its diet. Meaty fare should be offered several times per week to help provide extra protein. A veggie clip with dried seaweed hung from the side of the tank makes it easier to keep a good supply of macroalgae available to the Powder Brown Tang.</p><h2>Breeding the Powder Brown Tang </h2><p>Powder Browns are group spawning fish; their eggs are fertilized at the same time that they are released, and they float along the surface of the water. It is extraordinarily difficult to care for the larval Tangs, and as a result virtually all captive Power Brown Tangs are wild-caught.</p>",1024

The eyes may also appear cloudy. When left untreated, popeye disease can cause a fish to lose its eyesight or even result in the loss of an eye. Fish popeye has several potential causes, including infection, injury, and poor water condition. You can usually treat popeye in fish, but the treatment depends on the cause.</p><h2>What Is Popeye Disease? </h2><p>Popeye disease medically known as exophthalmia is a condition where the eye of the fish is swollen and protrudes abnormally from its socket. Note that some species of aquarium fish, such as black moor goldfish and telescope-eye goldfish normally have protruding eyes; this is not the same as popeye disease. Fish popeye can affect a single eye or both eyes. The fish's eyes may also appear cloudy in some cases.</p><h2>Symptoms of Popeye Disease </h2><p>The defining symptom of popeye disease is one or both of an aquarium fish's eyes bulging from the socket. The bulge might be subtle, especially early in the disease, or can be quite striking with the entire eye and socket appearing extremely swollen. Depending on the cause and severity of the popeye, the fish may show other signs of illness as well.</p><h3>Signs of Popeye Disease in Aquarium Fish</h3><p>In fish species that do not normally have protruding eyes, popeye starts with a subtle bulging of one or both eyes. This is caused by the pressure of fluid leaking into the area behind the eyeball. As the condition progresses, the bulging can become quite pronounced and lead to further symptoms. If the swelling ruptures the cornea, the eye might appear cloudy, bloody, or discolored. In severe instances, it's possible for affected eyes to rupture completely. If this happens, the fish may eventually recover but will be blind in the affected eye.</p><p>The fish might also show systemic signs of distress, such as changes in behavior a formerly active fish now hides or stays near the bottom of the tank, for example or a loss of appetite displayed by not actively pursuing food. You might also notice your fish keeps its fins clamped against its body, its scales look raised or rough, or that its entire body appears somewhat swollen.</p><h2>Causes of Popeye Disease </h2><p>Multiple causative agents can be responsible for popeye, and sometimes the true underlying disorder is never determined. Most commonly, fish popeye is caused by an injury, an infection, or poor water conditions in the aquarium.</p><h2>Diagnosing Popeye Disease in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>There are no diagnostic tests or procedures used to determine fish popeye. Rather, you can diagnose it yourself by the characteristic symptom of bulging eyes on a fish not specifically bred for this trait.</p><h2>Treatment of Popeye Disease </h2><p>Treatment for popeye will depend upon the underlying cause. If the eye has been injured, it will typically heal on its own, as long as the fish does not develop a secondary infection or become stressed. You can help the fish recover by performing palliative care using aquarium salt while the eye heals (unless contraindicated). This helps to relieve the swelling. You should also remove any tank decorations that might contribute to further injuries, such as rough or sharp rocks, pointed plants, and decorative items with rough or pointed edges.</p><p>Regular water changes and the monitoring of water chemistry are also recommended throughout the recovery time, as poor water condition is a common cause of popeye, as well as other fish ailments. If water tests indicate a problem a drifting pH or elevated ammonia or nitrite correct it promptly to avoid additional stress.</p><p>Any fish clearly suffering from a bacterial infection should be moved to a quarantine tank to avoid infecting other fish. Treat this fish with a broad-spectrum antibiotic recommended by your pet supplier or veterinarian to resolve the infection. If more than one fish is infected, it may be necessary to treat the main tank with antibiotics, as well. And all fish should be fed high-quality food to support healthy immune systems.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Popeye Disease </h2><p>Luckily, as long as you take steps to correct or eliminate the cause of the popeye disease, your fish is likely to make a full recovery, particularly if the condition was caused by an injury. However, if infection or water imbalance is to blame, and is not addressed promptly, your fish may lose the affected eye, or even succumb to stress or infection.</p><h2>How to Prevent Popeye Disease </h2><p>Because popeye is caused by such a wide variety of issues, there is no magic bullet to prevent its occurrence. However, if the tank is well maintained, partial water changes are performed regularly, and the fish are fed nutritional food, the odds of popeye striking are greatly diminished. Monitor the tank water chemistry and observe your fish daily for signs of illness to help tip the scales in your favor. If basic care is followed meticulously, popeye is unlikely to occur. And if it does, it probably won't be fatal.</p><p>Aitchtuoh, Fischer. Treating Pop-Eye. </p><p>Sanders, Jessie. Fish Popeye. Aquatic Veterinary Services.</p><p>Petco.

It may be a bit difficult to get them to eat when first introduced to the aquarium, but once they figure out that hand-fed foods are food, they adapt well. This fish has what many people call ""personality"" as it will follow you relentlessly when you walk by the tank until it is fed. If this fish is introduced into the aquarium at the end of the stocking procedure it will generally not quibble about the current housing situation as long as it can find a house of its own in the live rock formations in the tank. Including several potential ""houses"" in your live rock formations while aquascaping is always a good idea.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pink-Tail Triggerfish, Red-Tailed Triggerfish</p><p>Adult Size: 15 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The distribution of this species extends throughout the Indo-Pacific from Hawaii and the Tuamotu Islands westward through Polynesia, Micronesia, the Philippines, and the East Indies, and on across the Indian Ocean to the coast of Africa. It can be found from northwestern to central Australia including the entire length of the Great Barrier Reef.</p><p>The Pinktail Triggerfish swims in seaward reefs, diving up to 187 feet. It explores in loose groups, spending most of its time in search of foods such as crustaceans, algae, sponges, and detritus.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>This Triggerfish is named for its very pretty ""pink tail."" The body is so dark it looks black, but in reality, it is a very deep forest green color. The dorsal and anal fins have a translucent pinkish-white appearance marked with dark bands at the outside edges, and the pectoral fins have a yellowish color to them.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The Pinktail Triggerfish is one of the few Triggers that can be a pleasure to keep. This Trigger can be shy at first but will become quite docile and outgoing over time. It is rarely aggressive toward its tank mates unless they are much smaller or introduced to the tank after the Pinktail. If more than one is to be kept in the same tank, it is best to add a male and up to several females at the same time.</p><p>Be aware that the Triggerfish feeds on crustaceans and small fish in the wild. Thus, snails, crabs, and tiny or very shy fish do run a danger of being eaten. It's best to choose fish that are about the same size as the Triggerfish and able to stand their ground.</p><h2>Pinktail Triggerfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>In the wild, this fish generally inhabits the shallower waters outside the reef that has very rocky, stony or corally terrain where it can hide. You can replicate this environment in your tank, being careful to avoid including the type of crustaceans and mollusks that are usually Triggerfish food. Pinktails eat a great deal and can leave a bit of a mess, so a good filtration system is essential, as is moderate to strong water movement.</p><p>Provide the Pinktail Triggerfish with plenty of shelter and ample room to roam around. Triggerfish also enjoy rearranging rocks and plants in their environment, so select substrates and plants that can stand up to being shifted around.</p><p>It's important to know that, while Pinktail Triggerfish can survive in a smaller tank, bigger tanks make for happier, more docile fish. This species is bright and curious, so a habitat with lots of space to explore and plenty of interactive elements can be a big plus. It can also be great fun to watch your Pinktail Triggerfish as they rearrange their space, check out their tankmates, and observe your actions and reactions.</p><h2>Pinktail Triggerfish Diet </h2><p>Pinktail Triggerfish are voracious eaters and will eat almost any meaty food. It's helpful to choose harder foods, however, as their teeth continue to grow throughout their lifetime and chewing keeps the teeth from overgrowing.</p><p>Choose options such as frozen vitamin-enriched brine shrimp, Spirulina-enriched brine shrimp, Mysis shrimp, krill, or frozen sponge or mollusk-based foods. Chopped squid is also a good option. If possible, feed your Triggerfish twice or three times a day. Be sure to provide a varied diet so your fish can obtain a full range of nutrients.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>There are no visually obvious sexual differences between males and females.</p><h2>Breeding the Pinktail Triggerfish </h2><p>In the wild, Pinktail Triggerfish pair up, build nests, and guard their eggs against predators. In captivity, however, they are very hard to breed. Recently, a new type of food has been developed for Triggerfish larvae that may make home breeding a bit easier.</p>",757

These hardy fish survive at temperatures as low as 50 degrees F, but prefers 75 F  78 F and are best bred at 80 F. At one time they were companion fish in goldfish tanks and ponds, and still make great additions to garden ponds in the summer, due to their propensity to eat mosquito larva and other water pests ravenously!</p><p>It was one of the earliest fish kept as tropical fish in aquariums, but as species from the Amazon became available, they became much less popular. You see, Paradise Fish, are small, about 3 inches full grown, but are very scrappy, and vicious fighters, not good tank mates for most community aquarium fish.</p><p>They are, however, a fantastic fish for a hobbyist learning the art of breeding fish. The Paradise Fish is a species of fish known as a Labyrinth Fish (Order: Anabantiformes), which means that it has an accessory organ that allows it to breathe air at the surface, as well as breathing oxygen from the water through its gills. They live in shallow, stagnant water in the wild, such as rice paddies, where the oxygen levels in the water may be almost nonexistent. </p><p>This unique habit of going to the surface of the water to breathe oxygen has given them a method of breeding called bubble nest building. The males of the labyrinth fish will build a bubble nest at the surface of the water in which the female will lay her eggs. Some species, like the Paradise Fish and Betta Fish, are meticulous in their construction of the bubble nest and care of the eggs and young fish, others like the Kissing Gourami simply blow some bubbles, randomly fertilize the eggs, let them float off in the current and that is that.</p><h2>The Paradise Fish Breeding Process </h2><p>As in many other labyrinth fish, Paradise Fish build nests of bubbles. The male blows out bubbles of air and mucus, which rise to the surface and form a ""raft"", for lack of a better term. Then he follows an elaborate mating ritual that has been carried out in stagnant ponds and rice paddies for hundreds of thousands of years. The colors of the male will become absolutely brilliant red and blue as the mating time draws near (you will see where the term Paradise Fish came from at this time). Surprisingly, the female will become duller and paler during this period.</p><p>When the female is ripe (fat) with eggs and ready to spawn, the male wraps himself around the female under the ""bubble raft"". The eggs begin to escape the female's vent and are simultaneously fertilized by the male as the two remain embraced and barrel roll under the nest. The eggs float up naturally, which is unusual for Labyrinth Fish eggs as with most species the eggs sink and the male catches them in his mouth and blows them into the bubble nest. If some of the eggs begin to sink the male will release the female, who will remain motionless, and the male carefully gathers the eggs in his mouth and blows them into the bubble nest above them. He then wraps himself around her again and resumes the process over and over until several hundred eggs are laid.</p><p>When the mating is finished, the female can be removed, but she is in no danger from the male, again unlike most Labyrinth Fish, but her job is over and she can be put in an isolation area and fed well on high protein foods to recover.</p><p>When the clutch of eggs is completely laid, the male blows more bubbles to make a second layer under the eggs, sealing them in. This may be repeated time and again for the next 48 hours by the male.</p><h2>The Purpose of the Bubble Nest </h2><p>One reason is that the bubble nest protects the eggs from the heat of strong sunlight beating down on the rice fields by shading them. Another reason is that it protects the eggs from bacteria, the mucus of the male that he uses to make the bubbles actually has anti-bacterial properties. The third reason for the bubble nest is to keep the eggs together in one place, and retain the fry (baby fish) as they begin to hatch, so the male can more easily guard them against the danger of predators. This is where the more vicious nature of these fish becomes an advantage to the survival of the species!</p>",764

Nemo's traveling mate was Dory, a Hippo or Pacific Blue Tang. Ironically, in the wild (and even in an aquarium), the ""Dory fish"" acts very much like the movie character, seeming to have a short memory span and flitting all over the place. The producers did an excellent job of researching the characteristics of this fish when writing the movie. It's important to know, however, that Pacific Blue Tang are not easy fish to keep, and are certainly not suitable for children. </p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Pacific Blue Tang, Hippo Tang, Blue Regal Tang, and Palette Surgeonfish. Also recognized and known as ""Dory,"" the fish in the Disney movie .</p><p>Adult Size: 12.2 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 years or longer</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Pacific Blue Tang hails (not surprisingly) from the Pacific Ocean, but can also be found in the Indian Ocean, ranging from East Africa to Micronesia. They've also been sighted in Seychelles, Madagascar, the Marshall Islands, southern Japan and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia). They prefer coral reefs and rocky areas near the coast and are usually found at depths of 6-131 feet. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Pacific Blue Tangs have oval-shaped bodies and sharp spines along the sides of their scales. These scalpel-shaped spines (which earn the fish the name ""surgeonfish"") are usually kept flat along the fish's body but pop out when the Tang is threatened. Any predator in the range of the Pacific Blue Tang's tail will get a face-full of spines. The caudal spine also contains a toxin that can injure or kill other fish (depending on their size).</p><p>These fish change appearance as they mature. Juveniles are yellow with blue spots near their eyes; their fins have light blue tips. Over time, the fish's body becomes dark blue, with dark lines running lengthwise. Their tails and pectoral fins are bright yellow.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Pacific Blue Tangs are not the most sociable of fish and can be combative with one another. You can lower the risk of aggression by introducing several at the same time and providing them with a very large tank; otherwise, it's best to keep only one at a time. In general, Pacific Blue Tangs should also be kept away from all other surgeonfish. They can do well (as in the movie) with Clownfish, other peaceful fish, and invertebrates.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Pacific Blue Tang is very active, requiring a large tank, preferably at least 100 gallons or more. It enjoys grazing on live rock and needs highly oxygenated water which can be provided through increased surface agitation or air stones.</p><p>This species is not overly aggressive towards other tankmates but may become boisterous in the community. Juveniles can be kept together in groups, but adults will fight unless ample shelter and swimming room are provided. Be sure to have plenty of hiding places for them to retire to when they are challenged by other Blue Tangs. The Pacific Blue Tang will find the oddest hiding places. It will, quite often, stick its head into a crack in the live rock with its body sticking out and believe that it is entirely hidden. It will also lay flat on the substrate, thinking it is hidden, and allow itself to be physically picked up without a struggle.</p><p>Like most Surgeonfish, the Pacific Blue Tang is prone to contracting ich and susceptible to head and lateral line erosion (HLLE).</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>Unlike most Tangs or Surgeonfish that require a steady diet of algae, the Pacific Blue Tang should also be fed meaty fares to satisfy its zooplankton dietary needs. Finely chopped fresh or frozen shrimp, mysid shrimp, brine shrimp, and preparations for herbivores are suitable foods, as well as nori (dried seaweed) is accepted. To help with the healing of HLLE problems, foods can be soaked in a liquid vitamin supplement, such as , and Kent Marine .</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>The male and female look very similar, but the male is typically larger. Two males in a tank may often fight one another, using their sharp caudal fins.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>It's not easy to breed the Pacific Blue Tang in an aquarium tank. That's in part because their breeding habits require a coral reef. At breeding time, Pacific Blue Tangs get together in breeding groups. After the females expel about 40,000 their eggs into the water above a coral reef, the males swim through the ""cloud"" of eggs expelling sperm and fertilizing the eggs. Once fertilization is complete, both males and females swim away; the offspring are left to fend for themselves.</p><p>One day after fertilization, the eggs hatch. The larvae in a plankton ""soup"" for a period of time, feeding and growing until they are ready to metamorphose into juvenile Tang. As they go through this change, they change their habitat, settling into the coral reef. Juveniles mature while living in the reef, growing and changing both their appearance and their habits. Pacific Blue Tang can live as long as 30 years in their natural habitat.</p>",830

It is a very beautiful fish to have in an aquarium. It can be a good fish for a large community saltwater reef tank. It drastically changes its color display when it matures (in a good way).</p><p>The juvenile orange shoulder tang is one of the more friendly surgeonfish species and usually shows less aggression toward other fish. If you want to keep more than one in the same aquarium, you should ideally get juveniles and introduce them all to the aquarium at the same time.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Orangeshoulder surgeonfish, orangeband surgeonfish, or orange-epaulette surgeonfish</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 14 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 7 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The distribution of this species extends from Hawaii southward to central Polynesia and westward through Micronesia, Melanesia, the Philippines, and the East Indies.</p><p>As they grow, the orange shoulder tang will migrate to the highly oxygenated waters on or near the surge zones of the reef, where it will live the rest of its life unless forced to move by forces such as a hurricane which makes the reef waters uninhabitable.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>At first glance, the colors of the orange shoulder tang are not very bright, but upon closer examination of this fish, you notice a brownish-olive two-tone coloration accented by the bright orange bar on its shoulder.</p><p>Due to its eventual larger size, the orange shoulder tang is most often displayed in large public aquariums as opposed to smaller hobby aquariums. The body of this fish during its juvenile stage is bright yellow, with just the slightest hint of blue edging on the anal and dorsal fins. Juveniles lack the orange spot or slash on its shoulder, which develops as it matures.</p><p>The ""sword"" or ""scalpel"" at the base of the tail of the orange shoulder tang is not as large or dangerous as it is with some other surgeonfish, such as the naso tang (Naso lituratus) or the Achilles tang (Acanthurus achilles) however they are still large enough and sharp enough to inflict a serious wound, so be cautious when handling this fish. While the scalpel can inflict a serious cut, the major danger is a resulting bacterial infection, which can be very serious.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>As long as the aquarium is large enough, a juvenile and an adult may be kept together. It is generally compatible with other non-aggressive tank mates, but if plans are to keep this species with other surgeonfish, it is recommended to add this fish first, or if of the same species, place them in the aquarium at the same time.</p><p>The maximum size of the orange shoulder tang is about 14 inches.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>Because of its size and constant roaming nature, the minimum aquarium size suggested for this fish is at least 135 gallons with a lot of open swimming space.</p><p>It is a reef safe species as long as it is well fed. A hungry orange shoulder tang may nip over the corals and usually will not hurt invertebrates. The orange shoulder tang will require a few suitable hiding spots so they can claim one as their own if spooked or startled. Having a good amount of live rock in your tank will not only help you to maintain good water parameters but also provide a more natural environment for the orange shoulder tang as they like to pick at algae as it develops on your live rocks.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>Being an omnivore this fish feeds on filamentous algae, diatoms, as well as detritus off sand bottom substrates in the wild. It is best kept in an aquarium with an open sand bottom and ample algae growth for grazing. </p><p>In an aquarium, this fish should be fed a varied diet including marine algae (dried seaweed) as well as meaty fare. Hanging dried Nori seaweed in a veggie clip in the tank is an excellent way to feed this fish. The Orange Shoulder will take mysis shrimp, which is an excellent source of protein for this and other fish. Feed small amounts three times per day. You can also give cucumber, lettuce, broccoli, and it will also take meaty frozen foods.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>For orange shoulder tangs, the sexes remain separate, in other words, there is no gender switching with this species. This species does not seem to have any unique identifying characteristics between the sexes. Males will assume brighter courtship colors during mating periods.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>To date, the orange shoulder tang has not been successfully bred in captivity.</p><p>In the wild, this fish, as with other surgeonfish, is a ""free spawner"" or, in other terms, an egg scatterer with the female ejecting her eggs near the surface of the water and the male fertilizing the eggs as they drift to the surface. Once the fertilized eggs reach the surface they drift with the ocean current in the plankton layer of the ocean. The eggs mature, and the fry hatch out, still drifting in the current. The fry feed on the algae, larvae, and other microscopic life in the plankton layer. When the plankton and the fry drift close enough to land, the fry descend to the bottom of the ocean, usually in the calmer waters outside of the surge zones on the reef and in bays and harbors.</p><p>More Pet Fish Breeds and Further Research</p>",871
100,https://www.thesprucepets.com/nitrate-poisoning-in-aquarium-fish-1381288,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Nitrate Poisoning in Freshwater Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Nitrate Poisoning in Freshwater Aquarium Fish</h1><p>The danger of excessive nitrate in aquariums is often misunderstood by aquarium hobbyists. Although far less toxic than ammonia or nitrite, high nitrate levels called  or , can also kill aquarium fish. Chemically, nitrate is similar to nitrite, in that both consist of molecules of oxygen and nitrogen, but nitrate is a less reactive compound.</p><p>Nitrite contains only two atoms of nitrogen for each one atom of oxygen, making it a more reactive molecule, while the less reactive nitrate molecule contains three nitrogen atoms for each atom of oxygen. Nitrate is one of the natural byproducts of fish wastes and the end result of the ammonia-nitrite-nitrate cycle, and will build up in any tank that is not properly maintained.</p><h2>Nitrate Poisoning vs. Nitrate Shock </h2><p>Depending on the intensity of exposure, nitrate toxicity has two separate names: Nitrate poisoning refers to the chronic problem while nitrate shock refers to the acute problem of rapid onset.</p><h3>What Is Nitrate Poisoning?</h3><p>Nitrate poisoning occurs when fish are exposed to gradually rising nitrate levels over any period of time when regular tank maintenance is not performed. Overfeeding and overstocking of fish are also significant contributors to slowly rising nitrate levels.</p><p>When steps are not taken to reduce nitrate, the cumulative effect can be fish death. Some fish will be affected by levels as low as 20 mg/L while others will show no apparent symptoms until levels have reached several hundred mg/L. Juvenile fish are affected at the lower levels, as are saltwater fish. For most aquariums, it is recommended to keep the nitrate level below 20-40 mg/L by performing regular water changes.</p><h3>What Is Nitrate Shock?</h3><p>Nitrate shock occurs when fish are suddenly exposed to a vastly different level of nitrate, up to several hundred mg/L. This occurs when fish are transferred from one aquarium with normal nitrate levels to another with excessive levels. Although nitrate shock usually refers to a sudden increase in the level of nitrate, fish can be equally shocked if nitrate levels suddenly dramatically.</p><h2>Symptoms and Mortality </h2><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>When nitrate levels have risen slowly over time, it is not unusual for only one or two fish to exhibit symptoms initially. Until water tests are performed, there may be no apparent reason why some fish mysteriously become ill. If nitrate levels are not reduced, more fish will begin to show symptoms. Eventually, fish death will begin, occurring over a period of a few days to a few weeks.</p><p>When fish are suddenly exposed to very high nitrate levels, they will usually die within 24 hours of exposure. Often owners are not aware of the problem until the fish are dead or near death. In these situations, emergency measures can be taken for affected fish, but recognize and remove the source of the problem to avert further tragedy before new fish are added to the tank.</p><p>Most cases of sudden nitrate shock and subsequent fish loss occur when bringing new fish home to an aquarium that has drastically high nitrate levels. New fish are often chemically shocked by poor water quality conditions that current residents may have become slowly accustomed to over time. Nitrate shock can also occur when massive water changes have been performed on a mature tank that has high levels of nitrate, as any sudden drop in nitrate will also shock the fish.</p><h2>Emergency Treatment </h2><p>Most of the time fish will not die suddenly with gradual exposure to high nitrate levels. In cases of sudden exposure to high nitrate, it is possible to reduce the effect of the nitrate toxicity, thus giving the fish a fighting chance at survival. Perform a water change and test the ammonia, nitrite and nitrate levels in the water. The ammonia and nitrite should be zero and nitrate less than 10-20 mg/L. Methylene blue medication can be added to the aquarium water if the ammonia or nitrite levels were also high. Do not feed the fish for 24 hours, and then feed only sparingly until the water quality stabilizes.</p><h3>How to Bring Down Nitrate Levels </h3><p>To bring down nitrate levels, slow, controlled water changes will be necessary. The first step to a successful water change is to test the water to get a baseline nitrate level. This will give you an idea of how many changes may be necessary. Quick-test strips will provide a rough idea of your progress, but test kits using chemical reagents will provide more accurate readings.</p><p>The key to safely changing out bad water during a poisoning event is to avoid another sudden change which will provide too much chemical gradient stress on already stressed fish. Ideally, nitrate levels in a freshwater aquarium should be kept below 20 mg/L. However, any changes should occur slowly, only removing less than 50 mg/L of the nitrate per day.</p><p>If ammonia and nitrite are low and only nitrate is elevated, perform multiple small water changes. The maximum speed of concentration change that freshwater fish can tolerate is a five percent water change per hour or two, using water that is low in nitrate. Repeat changing only this amount until you have replaced approximately half of the total gallonage of water in your aquarium. This process will reduce the nitrate levels significantly, but slowly enough to avoid the effects of sudden changes on the fish.</p><h3>Continue to Re-Test Levels </h3><p>After the water change, re-test to find out how much the nitrate level has dropped. If the nitrate level remains above 100 mg/L, repeat the process the following day. Keep changing the water until you have reduced the nitrate level to 20 mg/L or less. Nitrate-removing filter media can also be used if nitrate levels remain high, usually from leaching out of filter media, substrate, or plants.</p><h2>Preventing Nitrate Poisoning </h2><p>Once nitrate levels have been reduced to normal, it is important to maintain the aquarium water properly to avoid another nitrate crisis.</p>",967
94,https://www.thesprucepets.com/neon-tetra-disease-1378484,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Neon Tetra Disease in Fish</h1>,"<h1>Neon Tetra Disease in Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Neon tetra disease is a degenerative condition caused by parasites that is both fast-spreading and fatal to fish. Named after the species that it was first identified in, this disease strikes many members of the tetra family, and other popular families of aquarium fish are not immune. Cichlids such as angelfish and cyprinids such as danios, rasboras, and barbs also fall victim to the disease. Even common goldfish can become infected. Interestingly, cardinal tetras are more resistant to the ravages of this disease than the similar-looking neon tetra. This condition is typically caused by a fish eating infected live food or consuming the remains of infected dead fish in the tank. Once affected, fish begin to lose their coloration, develop cysts, and have difficulty swimming before the disease progresses to a severe infection, ultimately leading to death. There is no known cure for neon tetra disease, so prevention is essential.</p><h2>What Is Neon Tetra Disease? </h2><p>Neon tetra disease is a condition caused by a microsporidian parasite that's more common than many aquarium enthusiasts realize, and it affects species beyond neon tetras. The disease is degenerative, meaning it starts mild but progresses quickly to become very severe. The parasite consumes the fish once infected, affecting its muscle tissue and often leading to secondary infections.</p><h2>Symptoms of Neon Tetra Disease in Fish </h2><p>The symptoms of neon tetra disease typically develop in a certain pattern as the parasite progresses.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Restlessness </h3><p>During the initial stages, the only symptom may be restlessness, particularly at night. Often the first thing an owner will notice is that the affected fish no longer school with the others a clear sign that something is wrong. Eventually, swimming becomes more erratic, and it becomes quite obvious that the fish is not well.</p><h3>Loss of Coloration </h3><p>As the disease progresses, affected muscle tissue begins to turn white, generally starting within the color band and areas along the spine. As additional muscle tissue is affected, the pale coloration expands.</p><h3>Cysts </h3><p>Cysts often begin to form in the muscles of the fish as the parasite infects these areas. It is not unusual for the body to have a lumpy appearance.</p><h3>Difficulty Swimming </h3><p>Damage to the muscles can cause curvature or deformation of the spine, which may cause the fish to have difficulty in swimming. Because the muscles are primarily affected, even those without curved spines can experience impaired movement.</p><h3>Secondary Infections </h3><p>Bloating in the body or rotting of the fins (especially the caudal fin) is not uncommon. However, these conditions are both due to secondary infection rather than direct results of the disease itself.</p><h2>Causes of Neon Tetra Disease </h2><p>Neon tetra disease is caused by a parasite called .</p><p>Once one fish is infected, the disease can also spread to others through damaged skin or gills or via transovarial transmission from parents to offspring. After the spores enter a fish, the parasite will eat the fish from the inside out, starting with the digestive tract and stomach. Sporoplasms develop inside the intestines, burrow through the intestinal wall into the skeletal muscles, and there they produce cysts. The cysts damage the tissue; signs of tissue damage include paler color and weaker muscles. While the disease was first identified in the neon tetra species and named for these fish, it has also been observed in many others including cichlids like angelfish, cardinal tetras, goldfish, and cyprinids such as danios, rasboras, and barbs (and additional common species can also be infected).</p><h2>Is Neon Tetra Disease Contagious to Other Animals? </h2><p>It's important to know that neon tetra disease is highly communicable, and the spores can survive in water for months. If healthy tank habitants ingest the body of an infected fish, it can easily spread through a tank quickly. One of the slightly comforting aspects of this disease is that it is not transmittable to humans.</p><h2>Diagnosing Neon Tetra Disease in Fish </h2><p>Spores of can be visually seen in the tissue of infected fish, and diagnosis may involve examining this tissue. Symptoms of this parasite can be compared to similar diseases to determine the cause, though microsporidian diseases in fish are considered untreatable. Fish may be quarantined when signs are first noticed to observe their progression and rule out other conditions.</p><h2>Treatment and Prevention </h2><p>There is no known cure for neon tetra disease. To ensure all fish are not lost, any affected fish should be quickly separated and removed from the tank. Many fish will eat other dead fish when given the chance, so this is a necessary step to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy fish.</p><p>The best prevention methods are to avoid purchasing sick fish and to maintain high water quality. When purchasing fish for your tank, select a well-regarded supplier. If buying online, observe any reviews and avoid buying for price versus quality. When possible, buy locally. This will give you a chance to carefully inspect the supplier's fish. Do not purchase any fish from tanks where there are sick, dying, or dead fish present; you can usually identify a sick fish because it will not school with the others (assuming that the fish you're selecting are schooling fish).</p><p>Once you've selected your new pets, quarantine new fish for two weeks before adding them to an existing community tank. This will give your fish a chance to adjust to a new environment while also allowing you to observe their behavior and appearance. If you see any signs of sickness, get in touch with your supplier and prevent questionable fish from interacting with others.</p><p>Maintain high water quality and select fish foods from a known and respected source. As with any fish or fish supplies, it's easy to wind up with contaminants even if you purchase high-quality fish food. However, the risk is greater when buying online at the lowest cost.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Neon Tetra Disease </h2><p>Since microsporidia are not treatable, fish infected with parasites will eventually succumb to the condition. Some species, such as angelfish, may live for quite some time with neon tetra disease, but they should not be allowed to do so in a community tank. Most fish found to have this disease are euthanized before it becomes debilitating.<p/>",1025

These unusual-looking fish are sociable and are even willing to eat out of their owner's hand; they're also fun to watch as they are very active. Naso Tang are best suited for a very large tank and do need the care of a moderately experienced aquarium owner.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Naso Tang, Clown Surgeonfish, Liturate Surgeonfish, Lipstick Tang, Orangespine Unicornfish</p><p>Adult Size: Up to 18 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 8 years or more</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Colorings and Markings </h2><p>Another name for Naso Tang is Orangespine Unicornfish, and it's easy to see where the name comes from. Naso Tang has scalpel-like spines near their tails; the spines are surrounded by orange coloring. These spines are extremely sharp and carry a toxin that can cause severe pain in human beings (and death to small aquatic creatures). To avoid interaction with these spines, it's best to use a net with care or to use a bag rather than a net to avoid injuring the fish.</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Naso Tang may be found throughout the central and western Pacific in locations including Hawaii, Japan, Tuamotu, and the Marquesas. A similar fish, the Blonde Naso Tang, lives in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Naso Tangs may be found alone, in groups, or in pairs, at depths of 16-295 feet. They frequent coral reefs and are usually found swimming above coral rocks among reef flats and slopes. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Once adjusted to aquarium life, Naso Tangs have great personalities and can be trained to eat food right out of your hands. It is one of the more aggressive Surgeonfish species when it comes to territorial disputes with other Surgeonfishes, especially of its own kind, but generally will get along with other fish tank mates and invertebrates. It is an interesting trait that they will attack each other, considering that they do congregate in small groups or schools in the wild.</p><h2>Naso Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Naso Tang is a moderately easy fish to care for, as long as it is a specimen that is already eating well when you buy it, you give it plenty of room, and provide it with ample macroalgae growth for grazing on. This fish is very majestic looking and definitely has personality, plus!</p><p>When you introduce your Naso Tang to its new home, it is likely to be shy and nervous. It may take a little time for it to adjust, and during that time it may be very picky about its food. If that's the case, be sure it has a live rock to graze on and consider feeding it lettuce and brine shrimp to be sure it's receiving enough nutrition. </p><p>This species is an active swimmer and is always on the move. A large tank is a key to keeping it happy and healthy, as is a good filter, sufficient water turbulence, and plenty of oxygen. Your Naso Tang is likely to swim back and forth all day long; if it is lethargic there's a good chance your pet is having health issues. Naso Tang does not have a mucus barrier on their bodies, and they are thus relatively susceptible to disorders including Marine Ich and Marine Velvet, and excellent nutrition can help protect them from these problems. Vitamin supplements, and particularly vitamin C, can help your pet to avoid infection. If your Naso Tang does develop Ich or another disease, they can usually be treated easily with copper drugs.</p><p>Wild Naso Tang often has the benefit of a cleaner wrasse that removes parasites from its body. While these particular Wrasse doesn't make good pets, Neon Gobies or cleaner shrimp are a good substitute and can help your Naso Tang stay healthy.</p><h2>Naso Tang Diet  </h2><p>This fish is a herbivore, with a diet preference for brown macroalgae (in the wild they prefer to munch on Sargassum and Dictyota). Some specimens may be reluctant to eat anything else, but for the most part, this species will usually accept the basic tank fed diet for Tangs & Surgeonfishes. On rare occasions, an individual may pick at large-polyped corals. The Naso Tang will also eat Mysis Shrimp and other meaty fares if it is offered to it, particularly if it sees other fish eating it.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Only male Naso Tang have trailing caudal streamers.</p><h2>Breeding the Naso Tang </h2><p>Naso Tang are pair spawners. Male/female couple swim to the surface together; the female releases her eggs and the male fertilizes them. The fertile eggs float along the surface of the ocean, carrying the larvae far and wide. To date, there are no reports of Naso Tang breeding in a home aquarium, though they will sometimes breed in captivity. </p>",786

121,https://www.thesprucepets.com/live-bearer-development-period-4040417,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Live-Bearer Development Period Inside Female and as Fry</h1>,"<h1>Live-Bearer Development Period Inside Female and as Fry</h1><h2>Find out what happens before a female live-bearer gives birth</h2><p>Temperature and light are important. The optimum temperature for fastest development of the brood inside of a female is between 77 F and 80 F and development will take approximately 4 weeks in the average live-bearer. At 68 F, the interval lengthens to some 35 days or more. It is important that live-bearers be kept in good bright light to simulate sunlight In dull light, the development also lengthens, and cool conditions plus dull light conditions will sometimes stop reproduction completely since this simulates winter conditions.</p><h2>Spotting the Condition and the ""Gravid Spot"" </h2><p>In most live-bearers, the pregnant mother swells unmistakably and also presents the well-known ""gravid spot"" which is a dark spot near the base of the anal fin caused by the stretching of the peritoneal wall. The female has a normal-shaped anal fin. </p><p>Slightly forward of this, inside her body appears a dark area which is known as the gravid spot. It is, in fact, equivalent to the womb, but unlike mammals, the egg is not attached to the mother's body and fed by her directly.</p><p>Each egg contains an embryo and is well furnished with nutritive elements, provided by the mother's system, on which the developing embryo feeds during its development. However, recent studies show that there is a symbiotic relationship between the mother and the developing fry with an exchange of fluids, the total extent of which is still under investigation.</p><h2>The Eyes of the Fry and Signs of Impending Birth </h2><p>As the eggs incubate, the eyes of the fry are sometimes visible through the thin walls of the gravid spot. To accommodate the developing eggs, the mother's body expands, becoming deeper and broader. A few days before delivery, she develops a bulge below the gills, her outline becoming fairly square in this region, while the gravid spot has enlarged its area.</p><h2>The Birth Process of New Fry </h2><p>When the young are perfectly formed they lie in a semicircular position and are delivered, usually tail first, one at a time, over a period of hours. On birth, the fry falls a few inches through the water, but quickly straightens out and, if strong enough, makes for cover among the plants. If these are not nearby, the fry sink to the bottom and take refuge in the sand, rocks, or whatever other covers there may be. They lie motionless for a short time while gathering strength.</p><h2>Why It's Ok to Remove the Male </h2><p>It is unnecessary, and in fact, inadvisable to have the male parent in the spawning tank. Once the female is impregnated, she can give birth to as many as five or more broods of young at intervals of four to six weeks. The number of each brood may vary from 12 to 15 babies from a young mollie to as many as 150 young from a large swordtail.</p><h2>Size of the Fry </h2><p>The majority of live-bearers are born about 1/4-inch long, and all their fins are formed in the normal shape. Most look like a miniature of the adult fish at birth. They are not only much larger than the newly hatched young of egg-layers but are also capable of swimming and looking for food and protection. Most newly born live-bearers are large enough not to require infusoria as the first food. In a few hours after birth, live-bearer fry can eat baby brine shrimp, daphnia, and even finely ground dry food. In fact, many will do just fine eating the left over's in a community tank as they survive hiding in the plants until they are large enough to emerge a month or so later. Many an aquarist has been surprised by new fish that suddenly appear in their tank this way!</p><h2>Record Deliveries by Live-Bearers </h2><p>The largest single delivery of fry by a guppy, as far as we know, was recorded by Paul Hahnel, the well-known Guppy breeder. Mr. Hahnel reports a brood of 170 young from one female, although only 120 of them lived to maturity. Dr. Myron Gordon found 168 embryos in a large wild-caught Platy fish. Swordfish mature at six to eight months of age while guppies are recorded as delivering their first brood when only 90 days old! Records kept of a female mollie show that she gave birth to 570 young, through multiple births, in one year.</p>",740
124,https://www.thesprucepets.com/freshwater-fish-lice-5196089,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Lice in Freshwater Fish</h1>,"<h1>Lice in Freshwater Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Freshwater fish lice are macroscopic parasites that present as small spots on your fish's skin. Fish lice are highly infectious and can be very dangerous to freshwater fish because of the parasites they carry. Symptoms of fish lice include lethargy, abnormal swimming patterns, and itchy skin. To diagnose a fish with lice, look carefully at its skin for spots visible to the naked eye. Immediately visit your vet for treatment options before the infestation worsens. The prognosis is good for infestations treated early, but anti-louse medications aren't always readily available. </p><h2>What Are Lice? </h2><p>Fish lice (Argulus) are a species of parasitic crustaceans that can affect freshwater fish. The louse is flat, oval, with a thin, needle-like sucker used to pierce the fish to which it is attached. Fish with fish lice have a high mortality rate, mainly because the lice can carry other parasites that lead to deadly secondary infection. In addition to viruses passed through the louse, bacterial and fungal infections can occur at the puncture site. Fish lice outbreaks pose problems to freshwater fisheries, sometimes necessitating season-long shutdowns while the lice are eradicated.<br/></p><h2>Symptoms of Lice in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>Lice can cause uncomfortable symptoms in your fish, but sometimes, there are no symptoms except the presence of the parasite.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p><br/></p><h3>Dots on Fish </h3><p>Typically, small, red dots will appear at the site of the louse infection. The red dots result from tiny hemorrhages, inflammation, or irritation from digestive enzymes caused by the parasite puncturing the fish's flesh.<br/></p><h3>Scratching </h3><p>Lice can be very itchy. If you notice your fish scratching against hard surfaces in its tank to relieve the itch, losing fins or scales in the process, your fish may have lice.</p><h3>Lethargy </h3><p>As a result of a lice infestation, your fish may act lethargic and swim less than usual. This is due to anemia brought on by the lice. The loss of blood caused by the parasite can lead to lethargy.<br/></p><h3>Abnormal Swimming </h3><p>Fish with lice may swim abnormally due to discomfort, or in an attempt to shake the lice off of its body.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Lice </h2><p>Fish lice infestations happen easily and are affected by several factors.</p><h2>Diagnosing Lice in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>Fish lice are macroscopic, meaning they can be identified with the naked eye. Once you notice the lice, bring the fish to a vet for a closer examination and identify any other possible parasites at play. Your vet may take impression smears from skin scrapes, biopsy the fish, or perform a nasal flush.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>There are many options for the treatment of fish lice. In some cases, a vet can manually remove the lice from the fish, but this can be risky to the fish and result in an incomplete removal. Only the adult parasites are removable, so lice in other life stages will likely remain on the fish's skin and in the tank. You should eliminate any eggs remaining in the tank with complete disinfection. Medications are available to treat fish lice, but they are limited and not approved by the FDA. The best way to treat fish lice is through low-dose insecticides. Do not begin any treatment without consulting your veterinarian. </p><h2>Prognosis for Freshwater Fish With Lice </h2><p>Your fish's recovery from fish lice will depend on the severity of the infestation at the point of treatment. Fish that haven't suffered from secondary infections should be able to recover fully with appropriate treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Lice </h2><p>Even with safety measures, fish lice can be difficult to prevent. It is essential to screen and quarantine fish for four to six weeks before adding them to an existing system. Additionally, you should quarantine live freshwater plants for two weeks, as they may also carry lice. This is the only way to guarantee that no harmful diseases or parasites will enter your current tank or pond.</p><p>Fish lice look like little red dots on your fish's skin.</p><p>Fish lice are treatable, but the success of the treatment depends on the severity of the infestation and the drugs available to you. There is no FDA-approved medicine, so treatment can sometimes be complicated.</p><p>Fish lice are dangerous, mainly because they often carry parasites of their own, leading to secondary infection in fish. </p>",688
163,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kole-tang-ctenochaetus-strigosus-information-2925733,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Kole Tang (Ctenochaetus strigosus)</h1>,"<h1>Kole Tang (Ctenochaetus strigosus)</h1><p>The Kole Tang is a terrific addition to almost any saltwater aquarium. The Kole Tang spends its time picking at all kinds of algae.</p><p>An interesting side note: In ancient times when the Polynesians migrated to Hawaii, they found a lot of Kole Tangs in the waters around the islands. They discovered that the Kole Tangs were delicious to eat and were so good that they decided that they should only be consumed by Hawaiian royalty. If a ""commoner"" was caught eating this ""royal food"" the commoner would instantly be put to death. Today, of course, this practice has been discontinued and the Kole Tang can be found on many dinner tables.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Kole Tang, Yelloweye Bristletooth, Goldring Bristletooth, Goldring Surgeonfish, Yelloweye Surgeonfish</p><p>Adult Size: 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5+ years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Kole Tang extends from Hawai'i southward to central and eastern Polynesia and Australia, and westward through Micronesia, Melanesia, and the Philippines, through the East Indies, and across the Indian Ocean at least as far as Mauritius. Apparently, this species does not inhabit this entire area, and specimens from various localities do appear somewhat different in structure and color within this area.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The body of the Hawaiian Kole Tang is brown in color and is marked with about 35 fine, light, longitudinal lines which continue onto the rear of the soft dorsal and anal fins at the back of the body. Indian Ocean specimens bear spots, rather than the distinctive stripes. The Hawaiian Kole's eye is encircled by a bright yellow ring, small blue spots cover much of the head, and the chin appears to be a purplish color. Some juvenile specimens have a greenish yellow color with blue markings and faint dark stripes.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Even though the Kole Tang is one of the less aggressive Surgeonfishes, it will battle with its own kind, and possibly with close relatives. Since it is less aggressive, it may also be picked on by other, more aggressive Surgeonfishes. For this reason, it is best kept singly, one per tank, but it does make a good choice when it comes to compatibility with other more docile, non-related species. To reduce compatibility problems it generally helps to introduce them into the aquarium at the same time. Like all Surgeonfishes, the Kole has a very sharp spur or razor by the tail, so use caution when handling this fish.</p><h2>Kole Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Kole Tang (usually just a single member of the species) is a good choice for a reef tank and they do pick at live rock; they have been known to pick at coral. Because it is very active, it's a good idea to provide as large a tank as possible (55 gallons is really a minimum, and 70 is better). Be sure the tank lid is secure, as these fish can and do jump. Temperatures should be kept between 75 and 82 degrees Fahrenheit; PH should stay between 8 and 8.4.</p><p>Kole Tang are relatively hardy, but do need well-oxygenated water and can benefit from cleaner shrimp and other ""cleaner"" species as they are prone to ich. The Kole Tang themselves are also fantastic at cleaning Brown Algae from the tank walls.</p><p>Be aware that Tang, like all Surgeonfish, do have sharp spines. This can be a danger when moving or handling the fish, so it's important to wear gloves and use your net with care.</p><h2>Kole Tang Diet  </h2><p>The Kole Tang spends each day constantly grazing and eating, so providing it with an environment with plenty of algae growth is best. Beware not to put one in a small reef tank, as it can do a lot of damage if you have delicate plants and algae growth that you want to keep. In a very large reef tank, the plant growth can recover, as the Kole has so much to pick from. The Kole Tang adapts to tank fed foods very well. It likes nori (dried seaweed), flake foods made from dried marine algae, and will even nibble on some meaty foods like dried shrimp and blood worms.</p><h2>Sex Difference </h2><p>Male and female Kole Tang are essentially identical, but some males do change color during mating season.</p><h2>Breeding the Kole Tang </h2><p>It's very unlikely that you'll be able to breed Kole Tang in a home aquarium. In fact, very little is known about how Kole Tang breed, except that they are group spawners. In other words, they congregate to release and fertilize eggs in the open water.</p>",746
108,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-your-betta-is-too-fat-5204612,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Is My Betta Fish Too Fat?</h1>,"<h1>Is My Betta Fish Too Fat?</h1><p>Body condition in all pets is a very important influence on overall health and wellbeing. Fish are no exception to the rule. Obesity in pet fish can be a critical issue, and even though their joints will be just fine, internal fat clogging various organs can be a serious health concern. But how can you tell if your betta is too fat or too skinny?</p><h2>Why Do Bettas Get Fat? </h2><p>Like all pets, bettas rely on humans for their daily diet. The internet is awash in conflicting information on how much, how often and what food to feed your betta. We've cut through the misinformation to give you the straight story on betta diet from a certified aquatic veterinarian with over 8 years experience in pet fish health and wellness.</p><p>Bettas get fat when they take in too many calories and do not burn enough of them swimming around. They can also get fat from ingesting the proper amount of calories, but too many calories are from fat and not enough from protein. Protein is the most important ingredient in a fish's diet and making sure your fish gets all the essential amino acids from the protein is critical to their health.</p><p>Too many treats, or food items high in protein or fat without a balanced nutrient profile, can also contribute to betta obesity. Although they may eat more foods in the wild, bettas in captivity have a significantly different lifestyle and are more sedentary than fish in the wild.</p><p>Bettas can also get fat if their metabolism is too slow from cold water. Betta's are tropical fish and require water temperatures around 78-82F (25-28C). If your water is too cold, your fish cannot digest their food properly. This can also cause lethargy since your fish will not have enough energy to swim around.</p><h2>How to Quantify Body Condition in Bettas </h2><p>How can I tell if my betta is too fat? Well, it comes down to body condition scoring, a method similar to determining if your cat or dog is too fat or too skinny, but with some differences. In fish, overall body condition should be determined from a dorsoventral view, or looking down at the top of your fish.</p><p>Observe where your betta's body meets the head. The head and shoulders should have the same girth. Your fish's internal organs are located in the coelomic cavity, just behind the head and they end about half to 2/3 of the way down the body toward the tail. A betta with good body condition should be torpedo shaped with a gradual tapering from head to tail, and If your betta's belly is poking out beyond the girth of his head, your betta is overweight. If your betta's body gets significantly thinner just behind his head, your betta is too skinny.</p><h3>Treatment </h3><p>Once you have determined your betta's body condition, or had a diagnosis from an aquatic veterinarian, start with some simple diet changes. You should be feeding your betta twice a day, since they are tropical fish in a heated aquarium. Feed a betta food that lists on the label the contents having approximately 35-42% protein and<10% fat. You should feed enough pellets per meal that would theoretically fit within one of your betta's eyeballs per meal. The fish should be able to consume all of the food given in 3-5 minutes per feeding, with no leftover food after that time.</p><p>High protein treats, such as bloodworms or brine shrimp, should only be fed 1-2 times per week.</p><p>Bettas fed too much and/or kept in inappropriate environments can be prone to impactions. This is a very serious health concern with limited treatment options. If your fish is not passing any feces or starts to develop dropsy, AKA kidney disease, contact your aquatic veterinarian ASAP. Be sure to monitor the water quality to keep your betta in ideal conditions.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Fat Bettas </h2><p>The best prevention method is to educate yourself on proper betta husbandry and diet prior to purchase. Rather than grabbing whatever is cheapest on the pet store shelf, take some time to review nutritional profiles on fish food packaging and make the best decision for your fish.</p><p>Be sure to replace your betta's food regularly. It is almost impossible for one fish to finish an entire container of betta food in an appropriate time. After 6 months, your fish's food has lost most of the water-soluble vitamin content, including vitamin C. Replace your fish's food every 6 months for best health.</p><p>Monitor how much food your fish can eat in 3-5 minutes, twice daily and only give it that much food. The amount can be adjusted based on its body condition, described above. Be sure it is not overeating. Over weight fish will have a shorter life span.<br/></p><h2>What If My Betta is Too Skinny? </h2><p>If your fish is too skinny, start by increasing their diet. You may want to feed smaller, more frequent meals at first if your fish is struggling to swim. Try to feed sinking pellets so your fish does not have to spend additional calories chasing his food.</p><p>Be sure your diet is at the appropriate nutritional levels (35-42% protein and<10% fat) and was opened within the last 6 months for optimal vitamin content.</p><p>If you are feeding a proper diet and your fish is not gaining weight, you need to consult with your aquatic veterinarian. There is a increased chance of diseases, such as a mycobacterial infection, in cases of poor nutrition.</p>",931

This is a common parasitic infection of freshwater fish and is one of the few fish parasites that can be seen with the naked eye. However, there are other non-parasitic causes of white spots on fish that need to be ruled out before treatment is initiated. Understanding the parasite's life cycle is critical to successful treatment.</p><h2>What is Ich? </h2><p>""Ich"" or ""white spot disease"" is caused by the protozoan parasite, which means in Latin ""Fish Louse with many children.""The saltwater form of ich or white spot disease is caused by . Both parasites have a complex life cycle that makes them difficult to treat. The large feeding (trophont) stage is visible to the naked eye as the white spots on the fish's body, but highly resistant to treatment. The free-swimming theront stage is not visible, but is the only stage in the parasite's lifecycle susceptible to treatment. It only takes one trophont to reproduce (as a tomont) after feeding on a fish, releasing 1,000 new infective organisms (the theront) into an aquarium, so infestations can occur very rapidly. The life cycle is temperature dependent, with fewer days between stages in warmer water and a longer life cycle in colder water.</p><h2>Signs of Ich in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>White spot disease can be mistaken for other non-serious issues. Fin ray fractures, or fractures to the cartilage of a fin, can look like white spots on the fins, but are not life threatening. Breeding tubercles on male goldfish, producing multiple white bumps on the operculum and pectoral fin, also look identical to white spot disease, but are normal anatomical variations. Lymphocystis, a viral disease in fish, can produce similar white bumps on the fins, but can be differentiated by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Causes of Ich </h2><p>The most common cause of Ich is failure to quarantine a new fish added to the aquarium. Since it only takes one infectious Ich parasite to reproduce and then spread through an entire tank or pond, most fish will ""look okay"" and not act sick at all until a few life cycles of the parasite are complete, which can take a few days to a few weeks, depending on your water temperature. Safely quarantining all new fish will prevent the spread of Ich to your main aquarium.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>For treatment to be successful, you may want a veterinarian examine your sick fish to make a correct diagnosis. Remember, there are other things on fish that can look remarkably similar to white spot disease that will require different treatment. Once a diagnosis is confirmed, there are treatment options available for prescription through your aquatic veterinarian and fish store.</p><p>Follow the instructions on the medication carefully, ensuring you have accurately determined your aquarium water volume. Overdosing can harm the fish, and under-dosing may not kill the Ich theronts. Continue treating every other day for 10-14 days. Perform partial water changes on the days between medication dosages. Carefully observe your fish to be sure that the trophonts (white spots) do not recur after treatment.</p><p>Monitoring and maintaining your water temperature is critical to ensure the parasite is completely eliminated from your aquarium. Many online forums will recommend raising your water temperature to speed up the Ich life-cycle. Unfortunately, in doing so, you may stress out your fish so be sure they are species that can tolerate warmer water temperatures before raising the temperature above 80 degrees F.</p><h2>How to Prevent Ich </h2><p>To prevent Ich or many other parasites and diseases from entering your aquarium, all new additions, including fish, invertebrates and plants, should be quarantined in a separate tank using separate equipment for four to six weeks. Quarantine will be slightly shorter at higher temperatures. Do not manipulate your fish's ideal temperature range in order to shorten your quarantine period. This can stress your fish and make them susceptible to many diseases and parasites.</p><p>All new plants previously kept with fish should be quarantined. By keeping plants isolated from all fish and inverts for at least two weeks, the parasite life cycle will break as there are no fish to feed on, and the parasite will die off. Ich requires a fish host to complete its life cycle. Use these two weeks to beef up your plants with some extra fertilizer since transport and handling can easily damage aquatic plants.</p><p>In order to improve your fish's overall health and wellbeing, be sure to maintain good water quality at all times and feed an appropriate diet. Keep up with a regular maintenance schedule. Check in on all your fish on a regular basis and understand their normal appetites and behaviors so you can quickly judge when something is wrong. If you suspect something is wrong with your fish, contact your aquatic veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><p>Francis-Floyd, Ruth.

It is a highly contagious and deadly disease. All koi owners should be aware of the clinical signs of this disease and the risks associated with adding new koi into their ponds without first testing them and placing the new fish into quarantine. All it takes is one carrier fish to take down an entire pond.</p><h2>What is Koi Herpesvirus? </h2><p>Koi herpesvirus (KHV) is a highly virulent virus in all varieties of koi and common carp . It is an OIE reportable disease and found throughout the world. The disease is caused by , a closely related virus to the carp pox virus (link to article) and goldfish hematopoietic necrosis virus .</p><h3>Symptoms of Koi Herpesvirus</h3><p>Koi herpesvirus is active only in certain temperatures, and in the winter when the water is cooler the fish may show no signs of disease. The most common sign of KHV is multiple deaths once your pond water temperature increases to the active threshold for KHV of 60 to 77F (16 to 25C). Fish may be lethargic or have a decreased appetite prior to death, or show no clinical signs prior to death. A full physical exam of all remaining fish and water quality testing is critical in evaluating any pond with sudden deaths. Similar clinical signs can be seen in other viral diseases, including Spring Viremia of Carp and Carp Edema Virus or Sleepy Koi Disease.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Koi Herpesvirus </h2><p>Fish contract Koi herpesvirus through physical contact with infected fish, transmission between fish on equipment such as nets, and through water shared with infected fish. Classified as a herpesvirus, this disease has a latent stage that resides within the neural tissue of fish. If a fish were to survive an infection, they are assumed to be a carrier for life. Carriers can survive and not show clinical signs, but shed the virus to naïve fish in the pond, spreading the infection.</p><p>Like many diseases in fish, the spread of Koi herpesvirus is temperature dependent. Pond temperatures between 60 to 77F (16 to 25C) are within the range for KHV replication. Some ponds may only see clinical signs when water temperatures are within range, then signs subside when the temperature increases or decreases.</p><p>Goldfish and some other carp species have been shown to be carriers of KHV.They will not show any clinical signs of the disease, but can spread it to susceptible species. Testing is available to determine if a carrier status exists in other carp species.</p><p>Carriers of Koi herpesvirus are not usually persistent shedders. They are more likely to shed viral particles when they are stressed from poor water quality, overstocking, spawning or other causes.</p><h2>Diagnostic Techniques </h2><p>Testing for Koi herpesvirus is available through your aquatic veterinary professional. Tissue or blood samples are collected from the fish and require a veterinarian to submit the samples to a diagnostic laboratory. PCR testing, using gill samples from live fish, or internal tissues from freshly dead fish, will test for active infections in fish producing KHV antigens. ELISA testing, using a blood sample, will test for antibodies to KHV and may be used to detect any carriers.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>There is no cure for Koi herpesvirus. However, raising the pond or quarantine tank water temperature to 86 degrees F (30 C) has been shown to inactivate the viral infection and help the koi recover. Good water quality, high oxygen saturation in the water, and treatment of secondary bacterial infections are important in helping the koi survive. Once a fish is infected, if they survive, they are assumed to be a carrier for life. KHV can have a very high mortality rate, between 80 to 100%, so do not expect all your fish to survive.</p><p>If an outbreak is confirmed, your veterinarian is required to contact your state veterinarian to report the event. You are not required to depopulate your pond. It is up to you and your veterinarian to decide what to do with any survivors. If you choose to keep your fish, the pond should remain a closed system, with no new fish added in and no fish being moved out.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Koi Herpesvirus </h2><p>The best method of dealing with Koi herpesvirus is to avoid it altogether. The most important aspect of preventing KHV is proper quarantine and testing. Quarantine duration will be temperature dependent, since colder water temperatures will slow emergence of clinical signs and the fish will need a longer quarantine time. Incubation time for KHV is 30 days at 50 F (10 C) but only 3 days at 75 F (23.8 C).</p><p>Some koi dealers will test fish before they leave their facilities, but the type of testing will determine if a fish is actually a carrier or not. All testing is required to be submitted by a veterinarian who will discuss any potential positive results with you prior to bringing your fish home.<br/></p><h2>Is it Contagious to Humans or Other Fish? </h2><p>Koi herpesvirus is not contagious to humans and most other fish. Infections have been demonstrated in goldfish and some goldfish x common carp hybrids. These other species can carry the disease and never show any clinical signs, but testing is available to be sure they are not carrying the virus if you plan on mixing them in with koi.</p><p>Hedrick RP, Waltzek TB, McDowell TS.

It is characterized by thickened epithelial growths along the dorsal ridge, sides, and fins of koi. It is a relatively benign disease, only causing aesthetic changes and does not affect the fish's overall health and longevity. Severe outbreaks can result in secondary skin infections but are very rare.</p><h2>What is Carp Pox? </h2><p>Carp pox is the physical manifestation of , a common virus in ornamental koi. This virus results in abnormal skin growths throughout your koi's body, concentrated on the dorsal ridge, sides, fins, and mouth. They can be very mild or quite severe, depending on your fish's individual stress level and immune capacity.<br/></p><h3>Symptoms of Carp Pox</h3><p>Like many other fish diseases, clinical signs of carp pox are temperature dependent. The skin lesions caused by the Carp Pox herpes virus are more commonly seen in cool water temperatures. When the water temperatures are warmer, up in the high 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit, a koi's immune system is significantly more active, and their skin turnover also increases. This will minimize or even resolve the carp pox lesions. This does mean the virus is gone; it just means the clinical signs of the virus are not present. The signs will likely return when the water cools seasonally.</p><p>Many online forums recommend surgical removal of the offending plaques, but this is not recommended. Not only are you subjecting your fish to painful surgery that may cause secondary bacterial infections, but also this will not prevent the lesions from returning. Once the virus has infected your fish and produced clinical signs, they will have the infection for life, even though the skin lesions may come and go. Again, this is not a life-threatening condition, and your fish will only undergo changes in its physical appearance.<br/></p><h2>Causes of Carp Pox </h2><p>Carp pox is caused by the herpes virus, . It is a cousin of Koi Herpes Virus, and Goldfish Hematopoietic Necrosis Virus, . Like other herpes viruses, the virus has a latent or carrier state that persists within an individual without showing any external clinical signs. Fish can be infected very young in life and may not show clinical signs until years later. Secondary stress can activate latent infections and cause skin lesions and infect other fish through direct contact or water-borne transmission.</p><p>Once a fish has been diagnosed with carp pox in your pond, it is assumed that all the other fish in the pond are potential carriers. In an infected pond, it is rare for more than one or two fish to show clinical signs at once, unless many potential stressors, such as poor water quality, are present.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that goldfish, can carry Koi Herpes Virus, so there is the potential that they can also carry carp pox. Goldfish will not show the symptoms of KHV when they are carriers, so it possible they can also carry carp pox between infected systems without showing clinical signs.<br/></p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Like all other herpes viruses, latent virions will bury deep into neural tissue, making them impossible to remove or treat. As for any species, herpes is for life. There is no treatment available at this time. Surgical removal of the plaques is not recommended since they will only grow back.</p><p>You may alleviate the symptoms of carp pox by raising your water temperature. This will allow your koi to better combat the disease and may resolve symptoms entirely. This does not mean the virus is gone from your fish, as the lesions will return when the water cools again.<br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Carp Pox </h2><p>As with all contagious fish disease, proper quarantine protocols are essential to ensure the health and safety of all your fish. Pond fish are no exception, however, they will require a larger holding tank. Do not take koi dealers at their word that their fish have been properly quarantined. Ask specifically about their protocols, including duration, treatments, mixing of fish from different suppliers, testing and if they've had a consult from an aquatic veterinarian. If they are hesitant to release any of this information, shop somewhere else.</p><p>Testing for carp pox is available for fish actively showing symptoms through your aquatic veterinarian. There is no test available for carrier status at this time. Because this is a non-lethal disease and the symptoms are very minor, koi owners should not be overly concerned about carp pox. In discussions with aquatic veterinarians, this is a very common disease and it is rare in some areas to have a pond that is not infected with carp pox.<br/></p><h2>Is Carp Pox Contagious to Other Fish? </h2><p>It has been demonstrated that other cyprinid herpes viruses are transmitted by other fish, such as goldfish, but that those fish will not show other clinical signs. Because carp pox is not a lethal disease, no research has been completed at this point if confirmed carrier status exists in other species</p>",894

They require and deserve just as much care as any other pet. Goldfish are hardy species and good at tolerating many beginner's mistakes, but you will need to put in some effort to ensure their health and survival. They should not be kept in a fish bowl, but require an aquarium with proper water aeration and filtration.</p><h2>Types of Goldfish </h2><p>There are many different varieties of goldfish. They are commonly divided into standard (long-body) and fancy (round body) varieties. The common Comet Goldfish is the most common pet fish species. Although they are often sold in the pets stores very small, these fish can grow up to 14 to 16 inches long and may require up to 100 gallons at their full size. Shubunkin and Sarasa goldfish varieties have the same body type, but are often more colorful fish, with combinations of red, white, black and yellow colors.</p><p>Fancy varieties of goldfish are numerous and have many anatomical adaptations. These breeds include the Oranda, Ranchu, Telescope, Fantail, Celestial, Moor, and other varieties. They have egg-shaped or rounded bodies. Given their body structure, they usually do not grow as large as long-body goldfish and may have some structural issues. These fish are more prone to buoyancy issues, spinal disease, and traumatic injury due to their protruding eyes and delicate fins. The Oranda goldfish has a fleshy growth on its head, called a wen, that may even need trimming if it overgrows the fish's eyes or face.</p><h2>Environmental Requirements </h2><p>No matter what variety of goldfish you keep, maintaining a proper aquatic environment is critical. You will need at least 20 gallons of water , and expect your long-body goldfish to outgrow this within the first 5 to 10 years. Comet goldfish can easily live into their 20s and some have lived over 40 years, with the fancy varieties usually surviving into their mid-teens.</p><p>Most goldfish are very tolerant of beginner water quality mistakes. They are very hardy species and can tolerate moderate levels of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate in circulating tanks. Once your aquarium nitrogen cycle has been established, it is recommended to keep your nitrate less than 20 mg/L, and the ammonia and nitrite at zero. In densely packed tanks, this may be hard to maintain without frequent water changes. Goldfish are notorious for constantly eating and creating a lot of waste hence the spatial needs. They can also tolerate a wide range of pH, provided your kH (Carbonate Hardness = alkalinity) is high enough to stabilize the pH levels.</p><p>Goldfish are natural foragers and may spend most of their time digging around in the substrate of their aquarium or pond looking for food. They like to suck every last morsel out of their meals and will often pick up small rocks in their mouth to clean off food particles. These have a very low chance of getting stuck in their mouth, so don't worry about your fish picking them up.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Do not use small gel bio balls in goldfish tanks. These may get stuck and cause oral foreign bodies that can kill your fish.</p><h2>Housing Goldfish Outdoors </h2><p>In addition to indoor aquariums, goldfish can also be kept in outdoor ponds. Their hardiness makes it easy for them to stand up against temperature changes throughout the days and seasons. Provided your pond is large enough and properly built, your goldfish may enjoy spending all their time outside, or, in colder climates, splitting their time between outdoors and indoors. Outdoor ponds should have at least 30 gallons of water per goldfish and should have aeration and a filtration system. The water depth should be a minimum of 3-4 feet, deeper in colder climates.</p><p>It is not recommended to put fancy goldfish varieties in large, outdoor ponds. They are not well setup to swim large distances and the increased depth can put additional pressure on their swim bladder, augmenting buoyancy disorders. Due to their poorer swimming ability, they cannot compete with comet goldfish or koi for food, and they are more prone to predator attacks.</p><h2>How Much and How Often to Feed Goldfish </h2><p>Goldfish are often compared to Golden Retrievers for their similar appetites and ability to gorge themselves. They love to eat and, depending on the temperature of their water, may seem almost insatiable. No matter what fish species you keep, since they are ectotherms, the warmer the water, the hungrier your fish will be. With water temperatures below 70F (21C), feed your goldfish at least once a day. Above this, you will need to feed your goldfish twice a day. Give the fish as much food as they will eat in 3-5 minutes.</p><p>Look for a goldfish diet around 30-35% protein and 5-7% fat. For reproductively active, breeding fish or juveniles, you will need to select a diet higher in protein and fat. There are many commercial diets available within this range for goldfish. Weekly protein-rich treats, such as bloodworms or brine shrimp, are appropriate only in warmer water. Shelled green peas, not actually a cure for ""constipation,"" are a better treat to feed more often.</p><p>Fancy goldfish and their buoyancy disorders can be related to diet. Being voracious surface eaters, a goldfish may suck in too much air during feeding and become temporarily positively buoyant. Switching to a sinking diet, or vice versa for negatively buoyant fish, will take advantage of their physostomous anatomy, where the gas bladder is connected to their digestive tract at the pharynx, and correct the buoyancy disorder without veterinary intervention.</p><h2>Goldfish Maintenance Requirements </h2><p>Although they are tolerant of beginner's mistakes, goldfish aquariums and ponds require regular maintenance. You will need to properly clean your filters on a weekly basis, but do  replace them all at once, as you may lose the necessary bacteria in them that break down fish wastes. Use a gravel siphon at least once a week to remove the debris and detritus from your substrate and top off your tank with conditioned fresh water.</p><p>As with all fish systems, it is highly recommended to purchase a liquid-based water quality test kit to maintain good water chemistry. Check it before and after your water changes to keep a close eye on the water quality in your goldfish aquarium.</p>",1034
104,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fish-slime-coat-1379911,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>How to Preserve the Slime Coat on Fish</h1>,"<h1>How to Preserve the Slime Coat on Fish</h1><p>If you've ever touched a fish, you know that it feels slimy. If you knew what that shiny, slimy stuff does, and can get past the ick factor, you may wish you had a slime coat too!</p><p>Fish slime coat is a marvelous protective barrier that helps maintain good health in fish. Unfortunately, we often unwittingly do things that damage that wonderful barrier. Here's why it is important to take steps to protect the slime coat of your fish.</p><h2>What Is Slime Coat? </h2><p>The slime coat in fish is composed of a glycoprotein (protein with attached carbohydrate) that serves as the frontline barrier to virtually everything from large physical objects to tiny bacteria. This barrier also works to keep essential fluids and electrolytes in the fish, and helps the fish glide through the water by reducing surface resistance.</p><p>Much like humans have various layers of skin, fish have multiple skin layers as well. In their case, they have skin (dermis) that produces a layer of scales. The scales, in turn, are covered by a thin layer of epidermis. Goblet cells in the epidermis produce slime. Any break in the slime coat is similar to an abrasion on our outermost layer of skin. Losing a large portion of their slime coat would be like damaging a large portion of our skin.</p><h2>How Slime Coat is Damaged </h2><p>Anytime something brushes against the slime coat; it is disturbed. Handling, hooking or even netting a fish causes a significant disturbance of the slime coat. Biting or nipping by other fish also can cause slime coat damage. However, physical assaults are not the only thing that can damage the slime coating.</p><p>Any stress can, and will, impact the protective coating of the fish. Low oxygen levels, temperature changes, and elevated toxins (e.g., chlorine, ammonia) in the water will reduce the protective slime coat. Changes in water composition, such as with salinity, pH or hardness are other possible contributing factors to slime coat damage. Parasites on the skin cause irritation that increases the production of slime by the fish, changing its appearance to have a white or bluish tint to the skin.</p><h2>Impact of Slime Coat Loss </h2><p>As previously explained, the slime coat covers the entire surface of the fish and is much like the outer layer of human skin. If it is damaged, it is similar to a burn or scrape in a human. However, fish can't put bandages on their slime coat to protect the skin. That leaves the fish wide open to disease and parasites.</p><p>Many fish diseases are caused by bacteria that are always present in the water. Normally these organisms can't get through the slime into the fish, but when the slime coat is broken or stripped off, the bacteria can overwhelm the fish like enemy warriors pouring through a broken gate in a castle. Soon the fish is overrun with bacteria that it cannot fight off. Likewise, many parasites are only able to get into the fish if the slime coat is first damaged.</p><p>Lastly, the slime coat maintains electrolyte balance and keeps proper fluid balance. A fish that has lost the slime coat has side effects similar to a human who has been badly burned, losing essential minerals into the surrounding water. Freshwater fish will absorb water through the damaged skin and can get over hydrated and bloated, while saltwater fish will lose body fluids into the surrounding water and become dehydrated.</p><h2>Steps to Take </h2><p>Although it may not be possible to avoid it completely, the best course of action is to not damage fish slime coat in the first place. Avoid handling fish whenever possible, which includes netting them. If you can scoop a fish up using a glass, instead of a net, you will cause far less damage to the slime coat. If you have to use a net, once you have caught the fish in the net, keep the net in the water and place a cup or bowl under the net with water in it, then lift the cup of water containing the fish in the net so that the fish is never out of the water while it is being transferred into another aquarium or into a plastic bag for transport. This avoids the fish flopping in the net while held in the air, which is more likely to damage the slime coat and skin. In general, don't touch your fish. If you must, wet your hands first, or wear smooth latex or vinyl gloves that have been wetted, or use a soft damp cloth to minimize the trauma.</p><p>Maintain good water quality at all times. Poor water quality is one of the leading causes of fish stress, which in turn, damages the slime coating. Perform regular water changes, keep the tank clean, test the water regularly, and take steps to mitigate rising toxins such as ammonia. Do not allow the water to rapidly change temperature, as this is also a major stress factor. Whenever new fish are introduced to an aquarium, turn the lights off for a few hours to calm the newcomers as well as the old-timers in the tank.</p><p>Any time a fish is under stress, there is a risk the slime covering will be impacted. Fortunately, there are aquarium products available at your fish store that promote healthy slime coat and also provide soothing relief to damaged coatings. These products contain polyvinylpyrrolidone or aloe vera, which attach to the fish's skin to improve the slime. Use of these products is good insurance against stress and disease, especially when transporting fish.</p>",973
116,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-is-infusoria-1379895,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>How to Culture Your Own Infusoria at Home</h1>,"<h1>How to Culture Your Own Infusoria at Home</h1><h2>Infusoria as Fish Food</h2><p>If you've sought information about feeding the newly hatched fry, you've probably been told to go out and get some infusoria. What is infusoria, where do you get it, and what do you do with it once you have it?</p><h2>What Is Infusoria? </h2><p>At one time, infusoria referred to just about any microscopic, or nearly microscopic, organism that lived in freshwater. That meaning is arcane in the scientific community, but the term infusoria is still used by many within the aquarium community, even by younger fish enthusiasts.</p><p>To aquarium enthusiasts, infusoria refers to many small organisms in the water that tiny fry can feed up upon.</p><p>Infusoria is particularly critical for anyone who is attempting to breed fish, as many newly hatched fry subsist entirely on microscopic infusoria during the early days of their lives. Having a ready supply of infusoria can make the difference between success and failure of the entire hatching of young fry.</p><h2>Where Is It Found? </h2><p>Infusoria live in a watery environment and can be found everywhere. Purified water purchased in bottles at the store is relatively free of such organisms. Outdoor bodies of water are at the other end of the spectrum, and they are generally teeming with many types of microscopic organisms. Even puddles of water by the roadside are full of infusoria.</p><p>Like other bodies of water, aquariums also have infusoria; however, the quantities are usually not sufficient to support newborn fry. Thus, aquarium owners must grow their own cultures if they want to have enough infusoria to feed their newly hatched fry. The items needed to culture infusoria are pretty common, easy to find, and don't cost an arm and a leg. However, before delving into starting your own infusoria culture, it's wise to know where to get infusoria.</p><h2>Common Pests </h2><p>It is not unusual for aquarists to trot down to the nearest pond and scoop up some water to get a good starter culture for infusoria. However, that practice brings considerable risk. The unknowing aquarist in all likelihood is carrying home considerable grief in that little jar of pond water.</p><p>In nature, there are often some undesirable elements hanging out with the good stuff. Water tigers, the larvae of the diving beetle, are particularly prolific and quite nasty. They'll eat anything they can get ahold of, including your young fish. Even bugs considered beneficial, such as the water boatman, can be dangerous to the small fry.</p><p>Needless to say, the dangers outweigh the benefits when it comes to taking water from outdoor sources to start an infusoria culture. Instead, the best option is to start your own culture indoors using your own items so you can control what is in the end product.</p><h2>Culturing Infusoria </h2><p>Home culturing of infusoria is relatively easy and inexpensive. A multitude of methods exist, but the basics are all the same. Take water with organisms in it, such as your aquarium water. Add some nutrients such as blanched lettuce, to promote the growth of the infusoria. Wait for the infusoria to grow, then feed to the fry. The nutrient material can range from lettuce to commercial preparations such as Liquifry. The key element is to ensure all materials used are free of pests that might harm the young fish fry.</p><p>The container used (usually a jar) should hold several quarts to a gallon of water. Ice cream buckets can work as well. Aquarium water is generally the best source for the water, but tap water can also be used. Some aquarists have even used the old water from a flower vase, as it is usually well populated with infusoria. Add the nutrient medium and let the whole soup cook in sunlight for several days.</p><p>As the infusoria grow, the water will become cloudy and in some cases, movement of the infusoria can be seen with the naked eye. The examination of a drop of water under the microscope will confirm the growth of the infusoria. Some aquarists will start more than one culture to allow them to be harvested at different times. With a little practice, it is possible to keep the culture going for extended periods of time.</p><h2>How to Use It </h2><p>Using your culture is quite easy. Simply siphon off a portion of the cloudy water, taking care to avoid sucking up pieces of the decaying nutrient material. Drop the infusoria-laden water into the tank with the fry to give them a tasty meal. Tiny fry requires frequent feedings of infusoria until they grow large enough for other foods, such as freshly hatched brine shrimp or commercially prepared fry food.</p>",764

They also learned that clownfish are attractive, relatively small saltwater fish that are sometimes kept in aquariums. Most clownfish, like Nemo and his father, Marlin, have bright stripes; the fire clownfish, however, loses its stripes as it grows into adulthood.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Red Saddleback, Fire Clownfish, Red Saddleback Anemonefish, Red Saddle Clownfish</p><p>Adult Size: 4 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 10 years in the wild; 18 years in captivity</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>pH</p><p>8.1 to 8.4</p><p>72 F to 79 F</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The fire clownfish is native to shallows, reefs, and reef slopes at depths of six to 50 feet throughout the Indian Ocean. It is most likely to be found in the tropical seas from Thailand to Indonesia, and in the waters off the coasts of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Thailand, Malaysia, and Java and Sumatra in Indonesia. These fish prefer silty waters where visibility is low.</p><p>Like all clownfish, the fire clownfish live in and among sea anemones, where it feeds on planktonic crustaceans such as copepods and shrimp larvae. This species generally lives in pairs, inhabiting two species of anemone: the  and .  </p><h2>Description </h2><p>The fire clownfish is the only Clownfish which does not have striping as an adult. In the juvenile stage, these fish have between 1 and 3 white stripes on their body and head. These stripes disappear as the fish grows to adulthood. At the same time, the fish develops a dark spot, or saddle, on their otherwise reddish body. The spot grows until it covers about half the fish as an adult. Fire clownfish also have 10 to 11 dorsal spines, two anal spines, between 16 and 18 dorsal soft rays, and 13 to 14 anal soft rays.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Fire clownfish are aggressive, especially when defending their anemone homes from other clownfish. They will gladly fight any fish that they perceive as a potential threat and are a danger to smaller, more peaceful species. While this species does live in mated pairs in the wild, you may be better off keeping just one fire clownfish rather than risking the possibility of a male and female battling.</p><p>When choosing tankmates, be sure to provide your fire clownfish with access to Buttletip anemone ( ) and Leathery Seal Anemone or it will attempt to find a home among stony coral polyps and damage them. Other tankmates may including similarly sized, similarly aggressive species such as Tangs and Wrasse.</p><h2>Care and Habitat </h2><p>This fish is ideal for a reef tank. If there is not a host anemone available, it may wallow in the tentacles of the Toadstool coral or large-polyped stony corals. Provide an aquarium environment with plenty of live rock, hiding places, microalgae, and at least one host anemone. </p><p>While they are beautiful, clownfish are also susceptible to a variety of diseases. They are also unusually sensitive to copper, which is an ingredient in many medicines intended for fish. As a result, you will need to keep a close eye on your clownfish pets to be sure they are healthy and check the ingredients on any medication you use to treat illness.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>An omnivore which should have a varied diet including meaty food items and algae. A high-quality marine omnivore flake food with these items can supply adequate levels of these nutrients. Feed two to three times per day. Food choices may include microalgae such as spirulina, zooplankton such as cyclops, and small crustaceans such as krill, mysis, and artemia.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>All clownfish are sequential hermaphrodites. In other words, they are born as males and, as they mature, they morph into females. The largest and most aggressive fish in the group is a female, and she is the only female to reproduce. Thus, if a pair of fire clownfish reproduces, one is a dominant female. If the female in the group dies, a juvenile male will change sex and become a new functioning female. To determine which of a pair of fire clownfish is the female, simply look for the larger fish.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>Fire clownfish are easy to breed in a home aquarium, though raising the fry (babies) can be more challenging because they are so tiny. A breeding pair will stay close together in your tank. The female will lay her eggs on a flat surface, and the couple will defend their eggs from others in the tank community. Fire Clownfish eggs hatch in eight to 11 days (the timing depends upon the temperature of the water). Once the eggs hatch, you will need to shift the fry to a separate aquarium. Feed fire clownfish fry on rotifers and then, when they are a bit bigger, on baby brine shrimp.</p>",797

Not only can these intelligent fish learn to eat from your hand, but they are also capable of vocalizing in several different ways. The key to success with this species is to provide plenty of swimming space, interesting rock formations to explore, and tankmates that can handle a larger semi-aggressive community member.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black Triggerfish, Black Durgeon, Bursa Triggerfish, Hawaiian Black Trigger</p><p>Adult Size: 14 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 6 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The Black Triggerfish is circumtropical, meaning that it occurs in oceans around the world at the same tropical latitudes. It can be found off the shores of Hawaii and Polynesia, in the East Indies, and in the Indian Ocean. In addition, it is distributed off the southern coast of Africa, in the Indo Pacific, and the Red Sea. A similar breed of fish can even be found in the tropical Atlantic Ocean.</p><p>In the wild, each Black Triggerfish has its own house to live in amongst the coral and rock formations just outside the reef, but they will emerge and congregate above near the surface of the water in large schools to feed on current drifting zooplankton and algae.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>On the face and around the eyes there are thin, light blue-turquoise colored lines. Along the base of both the soft dorsal and anal fins, there are bold white lines. The body appears to be black in the wild, but once out of the water with some light on this fish, you can actually see that its body is of a dark blue to blue-green color with horizontal markings present.</p><p>Like all Triggerfish, this species has a hard spiny dorsal fin that is usually carried flat against the fish's body in a special groove, but which can be locked into place when necessary. The Triggerfish uses this spine to hold itself in place when sleeping so that predators have a hard time pulling them out of hiding. The spine is also used to warn predators away and may be used as a weapon. When caring for your pet Triggerfish, use gloves to avoid painful encounters.</p><p>Triggerfish are also distinguished by their ability to vocalize. Black Triggerfish may make ""put put put"" sounds or growls; these noises are amplified by their swim bladder.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Black Triggerfish are one of the least aggressive of the triggerfish but they are, nevertheless, a poor choice for reef tanks. This species will nip at corals and eat reef invertebrates (even sea urchins). An aggressive species, it will also attack and eat smaller, more passive fish. Thus, Black Triggerfish are best kept in fish-only tanks with larger species that can hold their own. Keep only one Black Triggerfish at a time, unless you have a mated pair. Some good tankmates may include moray eels, snappers, angelfish, and tangs. Avoid housing Black Triggerfish with Lionfish, however, as the Lionfish are slow-moving and have long, tempting fins.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>The Black Triggerfish is a very active fish that needs lots of room to move around, and plenty of shelter for hiding. In fact, if placed in a smaller tank, this species is much more likely to be aggressive. Set up your large, fish-only tank with a variety of ""reefs,"" live rock, and hiding places for your Black Trigger Fish. </p><h2>Diet  </h2><p>An omnivore that can be fed a mixed diet of shrimp, squid, clams, fish, and other meaty fares suitable for carnivores, as well as marine algae and vitamin-enriched herbivore foods. Feed these fish three times a day, serving about the amount they can consume in five minutes. Triggerfish can actually be trained to eat from your hand at the surface of the tank, but be careful as they can administer painful bites.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>There are no obvious sexual differences between the male and female Black Triggerfish.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>Black Triggerfish select mates and lay and fertilize eggs. They then dig a nest in the seafloor, where the eggs are ""glued"" until they are ready to hatch. If the substrate is too hard, they will cover their eggs with broken shells. Both males and females guard the eggs, though the females do more of the guard duty; both males and females are quite aggressive when guarding their nest. Black Triggerfish are not bred in captivity.</p>",731

The seahorse ""stands up"" instead of lying flat as all other fish do. It propels itself through the water (very slowly) by vibrating its dorsal fin and steers with its tail. Perhaps the most interesting fact about this fish is that it is the male seahorse that gives birth. Seahorses have many natural predators that it evades with its ability to change its colors to blend in with almost any background.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Spotted, yellow, black, Vietnamese seahorse</p><p>Adult Size: 6.5 inches (17 centimeters)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 1 to 5 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The common seahorse is a wide-ranging Indo-Pacific seahorse that inhabits waters from Indonesia to the Philippines, Pakistan, and India to southern Japan, Hawaii, and the Society Islands. Variations of this species reside in other areas outside of the Indo-Pacific region. Approximately 23 countries have confirmed the native presence of Hippocampus kuda ranging from Australia to China. Because spotted seahorses are popular ornamental aquarium fish, their captive distribution has become global.</p><p>In the wild, the baby seahorses either become pelagic and ascend into the plankton layer on the surface of the ocean or descend to the bottom and attach themselves to algae, corals or other stationary objects with their prehensile tails and start feeding on small crustaceans as they drift by in the current.</p><p>Not being strong swimmers, seahorses greatly prefer to inhabit the calmer shallow waters in mangroves, coastal seagrass beds, estuaries, coastal bays and lagoons, harbors, and rivers with brackish water where there is seagrass or marine algae for them to hold onto. Common seahorses which have, for one reason or another been unable to make it to the shallows near land, have been found up to 10 miles offshore floating in the plankton layer at the water's surface with their tails wrapped around debris or pieces of floating algae.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Common seahorses range in color from black to orange and yellow. Black individuals often have silvery stripes or other markings on the body, and sometimes unique yellow individuals can be dotted with red spots. A protective trait that this and many other seahorses have is the ability to change color to match its surroundings. It is not unusual for them to take on the coloration of a favorite object one has decided to adopt as a hiding place. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Seahorses are generally solitary, except for their mates, which they like to remain in close proximity to. They are active during the day and generally avoid associations with non-pair individuals.</p><p>They may be kept with small, shy fish such as small gobies, pipefish, dragonets, and firefish. But aggressive, territorial, or fast-moving fish do not make good companions. Seahorses can be harmed by anemones and corals with stinging tentacles or corals that are large enough to consume them, such as brain corals. While sea fans, Acropora corals, and other branching corals may be safe for seahorses, they can be irritated or damaged by a seahorse that continually hitches to them. Crabs and clams may pinch a seahorse causing a wound that could lead to secondary infections. Small ornamental crustaceans may be consumed by the seahorses.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>A 30-gallon aquarium is sufficient for a single pair. Add 10 gallons to the size of the aquarium for each additional pair. Since swimming is not its strong suit, the common seahorse does much better in an aquarium with a very little current. Spray bars may be used to create gentle flow while eliminating stagnant areas in the aquarium. Seahorses use their prehensile tails to hitch to branching live rock, algae, or artificial decorations.</p><p>It also seems to do much better in a taller aquarium where it can drift up and down and attach to and hold fast to objects.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>Seahorse hitch onto an object and wait for its food to drift by, which it sucks up and swallows whole since seahorses do not have teeth. Captive-bred seahorses are accustomed to frozen mysis shrimp, making them a smart alternative to their wild-caught counterparts. They will also feed upon amphipods and other small crustaceans found in live rock. They will also accept vitamin-enriched adult brine shrimp, but this should not make up a majority of their diet. They are slow, deliberate feeders and prefer two or more small feedings per day.</p><p>Seahorses should be fed live, vitamin-enriched frozen (if they will take it), or freeze-dried mysis shrimp. Seahorses should be fed several times per day with food available for 20 to 30 minutes per feeding. Wild-caught seahorses may be slow to accept frozen or freeze-dried mysid shrimp as food, to begin with, and may have to be fed live foods until they are weaned onto prepared foods. Tank-raised seahorses are normally trained to accept frozen or freeze-dried mysid shrimp at an early age and will make the transition to your tank much more easily than wild-caught specimens.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>As males are the pregnant partner in seahorse mating, males that have reached sexual maturity have a brooding pouch. This is where the male carries the fertilized eggs. Breeding occurs year-round, so, a rounder belly pouch can signify a male. Around the breeding time, the male begins by changing its color patterns and does a dance around the female. It also produces clicking sounds with its coronet, a crown-shaped piece of skin or horn-like structure at the top of its head.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>Seahorses choose a mating partner for life. They maintain a monogamous relationship with one partner until that partner dies at which time the remaining seahorse may search out a new mate. This seahorse becomes fully mature at about 14 weeks and can reproduce at that time.</p><p>Not only does the male seahorse gives birth to the brood, but the male is responsible for attracting the female. After an elaborate courtship period, a dance, and intertwining of tails, the wooed female uses an ovipositor to insert her eggs into the male's pouch. It is in this brooding pouch where the eggs are fertilized and attach to the wall of the pouch. Placental fluid removes waste products and supplies the eggs with oxygen and nutrients as they mature into baby seahorses. At the end of 20 to 28 days of pregnancy the male goes into labor, typically at night when there is a full moon. The baby seahorses are then ejected from the male's pouch. The brooding pouch may contain anywhere from 20 to 1,000 fertilized eggs.</p>",1075
72,https://www.thesprucepets.com/breed-egg-scatterers-3573728,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>How to Breed Egg-Scatterer Tropical Fish</h1>,"<h1>How to Breed Egg-Scatterer Tropical Fish</h1><p>The egg scatterers include many species of tropical aquarium fishes  such as the Danios, Barbs, Rasboras, and Tetras. Even the Goldfish is among the group of fish that scatter their eggs among plants and gravel, both in nature and in an aquarium, while offering no parental care whatsoever! In fact, given the opportunity, most egg scattering fish species will eat the eggs they have just laid and fertilized as soon as the breeding process has finished.</p><h2>Adhesive and Non-Adhesive Eggs </h2><p>Most species, like the Barbs and Tetras, lay adhesive eggs that stick to plants as they are laid, but some, like the Zebra Danio, lay non-adhesive eggs that fall to the bottom. The typical spawning movement is a chase of the female by the males, accompanied by spasms of egg-laying and simultaneous sperm ejection and fertilization. Breeding activity may continue for an hour, or in some cases, like with the White Cloud Mountain Minnow, for several days, but a few hours is generally the rule. After spawning is complete, the fish go back to their normal activity, searching for food, including their own eggs. Nearly all egg scatterers will eat their own eggs if given the chance.</p><h2>The Challenge of Breeding and Rearing of Young </h2><p>With egg-layers, the challenge is in the breeding itself and then the rearing of the young. Most of the egg scatterers that have been tank and farm-bred for many generations will breed readily in aquarium conditions if the correct water quality and temperature are provided. Water changes often stimulate breeding.</p><p>To start breeding, it is important to give the fish the best food possible. Live brine shrimp are ideal, but frozen brine shrimp and freeze-dried foods such as tubifex worms are good too. Give this in addition to a good quality flake food. Set up a breeding aquarium, usually a 10-gallon tank, that is about half full of aged water, and has an air stone with gentle aeration, or a sponge filter in it. Add a small amount of gravel on the bottom, or even pebbles or marbles for egg scatterers, so the eggs will drop out of the reach of the parents. For fish that lay eggs on the plants, place the roots of many plants in the substrate around the periphery of the aquarium, leaving the center open for the fish to swim in. Fine-leaved plants are preferable for attaching the eggs onto. Most of these fish spawn in the morning, so providing low light conditions will also aid spawning.</p><p>Use several pairs of mature fish and place them into the breeding aquarium, and usually, within a few days, they will start to spawn. In most egg scattering fish, the only difference observable between males and females is that the females will get a rounded belly when full of eggs and ready to spawn. The males will chase the females around, and fertilize the eggs as she lays them on the plants (for adhesive egg species) or as she scatters them among the rocks on the substrate (non-adhesive eggs). Several hundred eggs may be laid by each female.</p><p>The eggs are laid on plants, or on the bottom of the aquarium scattered on the gravel. Once the eggs hatch in the wild, the fry (young fish) have to avoid parental cannibalism, usually by hiding in the plants and among rocks, until they grow large enough to swim freely. In aquariums, it is best to remove the parent fish after they lay the eggs and let the eggs hatch and the fry grow in the breeding aquarium by themselves.</p><p>Feeding may be the worst problem for the uninitiated, as the baby fish will need very fine foods to eat. Feeding live infusoria is one of the best foods for baby fish. Live are frozen brine shrimp nauplii are also great first foods. There are also commercial fry foods available at pet stores, and you can feed the fry finely ground flake food as they get bigger.</p><h2>Improving Methods of Breeding </h2><p>Many methods for the spawning and raising of different species of egg-layers are available. Fish living in their wild, natural habitat come from different water conditions, weather conditions, available food sources, and other factors than when they are kept in an aquarium. However, unless you are trying to breed fish that have been collected in the wild, basic aquarium water conditions are usually suitable for the breeding of commercially available tropical fish that have been raised on farms.</p><p>Perhaps the best general advice is that few species are actually as particular about conditions for successful spawning as most people think, and that cleanliness, healthy fish, and proper feeding are usually more important than fussing about with pH, temperature, light, shade and so forth.</p>",787

For fish, which have varying diets and multiple online recommendations, it can be hard for most owners to know how much food is appropriate for their bettas. As long as your betta is living in a filtered, heated aquarium, your fish has a strong start on a long, healthy life. How much to feed your betta will depend on a few key factors and how much time you spend around your aquarium.</p><h2>Preparing to Feed Your Betta Fish </h2><p>How much to feed your fish starts with what you should be feeding them. Being tropical fish, betta's metabolic needs require them to have higher calories in their diet. Bettas have to drag along an ornate tail, which requires more calories and lots of rest periods Research has demonstrated that the dietary protein level in betta fish should be around 35%, and can be a mix of plant and animal protein. Although wild betta fish consume an insect-heavy diet, most pet bettas will be fed a commercial diet that will also promote good health.</p><p>When it comes to commercial betta diets, pellet size will vary widely. It is hard to give a number of pellets per feeding that will be consistent for all commercial diets. No matter what diet you choose for your fish, do not expect one betta to actually finish all the food in a container before the food become stale. After about six months, the water soluble vitamin content, including Vitamin C, has diminished in quality. You will need to replace your betta's container of food before they actually finish all of it.<br/></p><h2>How Much to Feed Your Betta Fish </h2><p>Given the variation in pellet size in commercial diets, the best recommendation for betta fish feeding is to consider your fish's anatomy. For one meal, feed your betta the same amount of pellets that would theoretically be the size of one of its eyeballs. Depending on the diet you select, this could be as few as two or three pellets, or as many as 10 to 12. If you have to feed more than eight pellets, start with half of the amount, allow your fish to finish eating, then feed the second half. The betta should be able to eat all of the food in about five minutes time.</p><p>But what about frozen and freeze-dried protein-rich diets? Yes, we know that wild bettas subsist mainly on high protein insect diets, but the lifestyle of a wild fish is significantly different from those in captivity. Wild fish have to live through periods of fasting, when food is scarce, fight other fish for resources and to reproduce. Captive bettas do not have to worry about these things, so their dietary requirements will be less. High protein treats, such as freeze-dried and frozen diets, should be fed sparingly no more than once or twice a week. If you are breeding your fish, they will have different dietary requirements.<br/></p><h2>How Often to Feed Your Betta Fish </h2><p>Most tropical fish will spend their days foraging for food. They are not built to have large, infrequent meals, and bettas are no exception. It is best to feed your betta at least twice a day. If you have access to your aquarium throughout the day, three meals are also acceptable. Try to space them out equally. Remember, proper water temperature is critical to proper digestion and metabolism. Be sure to have a reliable heater and thermometer in your betta aquarium and check them daily.</p><p>If you will be away for more than a day, plan to feed your fish using a timed vacation feeder or a trusted fish sitter. You cannot fast bettas for more than a few days.<br/></p><h2>How to Avoid Overfeeding </h2><p>Overfeeding in bettas leads to a large, distended abdomen (coelomic cavity). You can see symptoms of lethargy and dropsy (bloating) as the internal organs are damaged. Overfeeding can present signs similar to mycobacteria infection, or fish tuberculosis, so it is critical you get your fish diagnosed by your aquatic veterinarian in order to protect your own health. The sooner you notice your fish is getting too large, the more successful any treatments will be. If you wait too long, there is no treatment that can help your fish.</p><p>Overfeeding occurs in bettas that are fed too much food for their metabolism to digest. The main factor affecting metabolism is water temperature. Water that is too cold for your fish will significantly slow down its metabolism. Be sure to have a reliable thermometer on your aquarium and check it daily to ensure the water temperature is appropriate (77-80 degrees Fahrenheit) for your betta.</p><p>Pellet size varies among commercial diets, but as long as you stick to the amount of pellets equal to the size of the fish's eyeball per feeding, pellet size is irrelevant. Feeding your fish one big meal a day can easily lead to overfeeding. Smaller meals throughout the day are easier for your fish to consume and digest and keep your betta healthier.</p><p>James, Raja, and Kunchitham Sampath.

123,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-often-to-feed-fish-1380923,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>How Much and How Often Should You Feed Your Fish?</h1>,"<h1>How Much and How Often Should You Feed Your Fish?</h1><h2>Keep your fish healthy by not overfeeding them</h2><p>Overfeeding is the most common mistake new fish owners make. When you give fish too much food, the remnants can clog your filter and break down into toxins that are harmful to fish. Hence the warnings on fish food packages not to overfeed the fish.</p><h2>Understand How Fish Eat </h2><p>In nature, fish eat whenever they are hungry and food is available. If food sources are plentiful, they will eat several times a day. On the other hand, if food sources are scarce, they might go for days between meals. For this reason, fish are very opportunistic and will eat whenever they have a chance.</p><p>That means that if you offer them food, they will usually gobble it up, even if they aren't starving. Keep that in mind the next time your fish ""beg"" for food. Fish quickly learn who brings the food to the tank and will jump at the chance to be fed, even if they are not in dire need of food.</p><h2>Number of Feedings per Day </h2><p>How often you need to feed your fish depends on the kind of fish you have. In general, most fish do quite well on one feeding per day. However, some owners prefer to feed their fish twice a day. Young, growing fish might need to eat three or more times per day. Regardless of the number of feedings, the key is to keep each feeding very small.</p><p>Most fish will do well with two meals a day. The timing is not critical, with the exception of nocturnal feeders. If you have nocturnal fish in your tank, such as certain catfish, be sure to feed them just before turning the lights out at night. They will hunt for the food in the dark, using their keen sense of smell to find it.</p><p>There are some exceptions to the once-per-day feeding rule. Herbivores (vegetarian fish) like silver dollars, mollies, and farlowellas need to eat frequently because they have smaller stomachs that cannot hold a lot of food. In nature, they would graze all day on plants. They should be given several small feedings a day or be provided with live plants they can nibble on. Goldfish do not have a stomach at all, so shouldn't be fed a large meal all at one time. They naturally nibble on algae and other food items throughout the day, so it is better to feed them several small meals during the day rather than giving them a big meal only once a day.</p><p>Newly hatched fry and young fish who are not fully grown require more frequent feedings of special foods designed for fry.</p><h2>Determining the Right Amount of Food </h2><p>A good rule of thumb is to give your fish no more food than they will consume in less than five minutes. When in doubt, underfeed. You can always give them another small feeding if necessary.</p><p>Also, keep in mind that the type of food is just as important as the amount. You want to ensure your fish are getting the proper nutrition they need to stay healthy. Also, if you have a community of fish, you'll need to consider every species' dietary needs and find food to balance that out.</p><h2>What Happens If You Overfeed Fish? </h2><p>If you overfeed your fish, the effects may not be apparent at first. It's a myth that fish will explode from eating too much, so you don't have to worry about that. However, there are other health concerns associated with overfeeding.</p><p>It is possible for some fish species to develop a fatty liver disease (hepatic lipidosis). Overfeeding can also stress the fish and the negative effects on the aquatic environment itself will affect the health of your fish.</p><p>Uneaten food will produce by-products (ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate) that can be harmful to fish. In the event that you do overfeed, promptly remove the uneaten food using a siphon or net. If you do not remove the excess food, you risk affecting the chemistry of the aquarium water. Nitrite and ammonia levels can rise and the oxygen and pH can drop to life-threatening levels. The by-products can also cloud the water, promote an algae bloom, or encourage mold or planaria to grow out of control.</p>",716
113,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-long-do-goldfish-live-5223675,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>How Long Do Goldfish Live?</h1>,"<h1>How Long Do Goldfish Live?</h1><p>When you first bring home your goldfish, how long can you expect them to live? Is a 6-or-7-year-old goldfish dying from old age? Absolutely not. For most comet goldfish, you can expect at least 20 years, with the world record goldfish living for 42 years! Most of the time, as they get larger, goldfish start to get too large for a small aquarium, resulting in poor water quality and stress. This frequently results in secondary illness due to decreased immune function from chronic stress. In order to take proper care of your goldfish in their later years, be prepared for 30 gallons or more per fish. With proper care, goldfish can easily live a long and healthy life.</p><h2>Fancy vs. Standard Goldfish </h2><p>There are a wide variety of goldfish in the pet industry. With round bodies, protruding eyeballs and ornate fins, fancy varieties of goldfish can be quite elaborate. In order to obtain these unique individuals, many generations of goldfish have been cross bred. This has led to fancy goldfish having shorter life spans than standard comet goldfish. Most fancy varieties of goldfish should live into their teens, but 20 years is not common.</p><h2>What Can You Do to Help Lengthen Lifespan? </h2><p>In order to help your goldfish live a long and happy life, proper care of goldfish comes down to providing them the correct environment and diet. These will both change as your goldfish gets older and grows larger.</p><h3>Correct Environment </h3><p>All fish may start small, but many goldfish have the potential to grow as large as a dinner plate! Contrary to popular belief, goldfish do not ""grow to the size of their container."" Starting your goldfish in a 20-gallon tank (that's per fish!) will work for the first few years, but plan on upgrading them as they grow over the years.<br/></p><p>Goldfish are hungry fish and do not convert their food into mass very well, so they produce a lot of waste. This waste ends up in their aquarium water, causing water quality issues that requiring frequent cleaning. When fish are swimming in gross water, their immune system does not work well and the fish will get sick from secondary infections from environmental bacteria and any lingering<br/>parasites. This is the most common cause of goldfish death that is commonly attributed to ""old age,"" when it actually has to do with your fish's limited space and poor water quality.</p><h3>Diet and Feeding </h3><p>There are a wide variety of goldfish diets on the pet store shelves. Often, owners are overwhelmed with options and settle on flashy packaging or pricing to guide their decisions, neither of which has any influence on food quality. When it comes to goldfish diets, owner's should pay attention to the protein and fat content of the diet that is listed on the label. Goldfish require approximately 30% protein for proper body maintenance. Growing juveniles will require more protein, around 35-45%. Fat requirements for goldfish are low due to their limited activity. For maintenance, your goldfish will require around 6% fat, with young fish and reproductively-active fish requiring around 10% fat in the diet.</p><p>Flake diets are only for tiny fish. Once your goldfish can eat a pellet, they should be switched over from flakes to pellets. Goldfish pellets come in very small sizes these days, so size is not an excuse to keep feeding your fish flakes. Pellets retain their nutrition significantly better than flakes due to their lower surface-to-mass ratio. Your fish may not like the switch because flakes smell and taste better than pellets. Use some tough love and tell your fish it's better for their overall health, not to mention less waste for you to clean! Remember to replace your container of fish food every six months to maintain good vitamin content.</p><h2>Geriatric Goldfish Care </h2><p>Once your goldfish actually reaches ""geriatric"" age in their late teens and early 20s or early teens for fancy varieties you can expect to see some changes in their behavior. As they get older, expect your goldfish to not swim as much and take extended rest periods on the bottom of their aquarium. You will need to keep their water quality and tank clean in order to support them in their later years. Some goldfish may start to eat a little less, but this is not common. Older goldfish may be more selective about their diet, so offering a variety of pellets may be required in order to maintain their nutrition. Do not just feed them treats, such as dried or frozen shrimp. All fish require a well-rounded diet that most pellets can provide, made from a mix of proteins and veggies.</p><p>Overall, goldfish are one of the most long-lived pet species, so a death at less than 10 years old is usually not age-related. More often, as they grow, goldfish max out their space and resources. What is appropriate for a small goldfish will not be the same for life. Adjust the aquarium size and filtration as your pet goldfish grows to provide a proper habitat for a long and happy life.</p>",839
105,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-do-fish-get-parasites-5224910,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>How Do Fish Get Parasites?</h1>,"<h1>How Do Fish Get Parasites?</h1><p>Parasitic infestations are common in fish. Fish may have parasites on them all the time, but with a healthy immune system, they are able to keep the problem in check. A stressed fish will cause a drop in immune function, which allows the parasite to flourish. How should you protect your fish against parasitic infestations and what should you do if you suspect one is running wild in your tank?<br/></p><h2>Parasites Found on Fish </h2><p>Depending on if your fish lives in saltwater or freshwater, they will be susceptible to different parasites. Thankfully, none of the parasites will jump between saltwater and freshwater. Almost all of them require a fish to complete their life cycle, so empty aquariums and filters will not sustain parasites very long. There are commensal worms and even protozoa that live in filters that are often confused with fish parasites. Some parasites may require an invertebrate host to complete their life cycle, and the parasite won't reproduce without this diversity in your aquarium. Common parasites in freshwater pet fish include protozoa white spot disease (Ich), Trichodina, Costia and Chilodonella, as well as the flatworm skin and gill flukes. In marine fish, you should be aware of Cryptocaryon, Uronema, and Marine Velvet, in addition to others. <br/></p><p>Most parasites on pet fish are external. Unless your fish has come from the wild, it is less common for them to have any internal parasites. There are intestinal worms, such as Capillaria and Camallanus, and the intestinal Protozoa Spironucleus that can occur inside fish. These may cause a change in feces, and the fish may lose weight. Clear fecal casts, commonly referred to as ""white stringy poop,"" can be confused for a parasitic worm. </p><p>Parasites can also affect the gill tissue, which can provide a parasite with lots of direct nutrition. Gills are critical to adequate oxygen levels for your fish and parasites on them can cause reduced respiration and severe health issues. Some parasites are specific to gills, but high numbers of parasites on the skin can lead to them migrating to the gills. <br/></p><h2>How to Prevent Parasites on Your Fish </h2><p>It is impossible to ensure your fish is 100% parasite free. You cannot sterilize a fish in order to remove all its parasites, so providing a healthy environment for your fish goes a long way. Fish stay healthy with clean water and a high-quality diet. <br/></p><p>The most common way a parasite infestation takes off is when a new fish is added into an established system. The stress from capture, transport, and introduction to a foreign environment causes any parasites on the new fish to quickly spread to the others in the aquarium. Fish move through pet stores very quickly, so they may not look sick at first. After a few days of incubating on a fish, the parasites can reach critical levels that make your fish ill. <br/></p><p>In order to help your fish stay healthy, you must quarantine them for four to six weeks in a separate system. This will ensure that any parasites riding on the new fish will not affect the entire system. In quarantine, a fish can recover from their trip and have a space of their own with no competition for food. After the quarantine period, if they have not gotten ill, they can be moved to the main aquarium with proper acclimation. If they get sick in their quarantine tank, you will only have to treat a few fish in a smaller system. <br/></p><h2>How to Know if Your Fish Has a Parasite </h2><p>If your fish has a clinical parasite infestation, it may exhibit a variety of signs. Physically, you may not be able to see the parasite. Macroscopic parasites such as fish lice and anchor worms are large enough to be seen with the naked eye, but can be confused for other skin issues. Other signs of a parasite infestation include missing scales, bruising or increased mucus coat, often seen as frosting, white patches, or bumps. Individual white spots on the fish are a common sign of some skin parasites.<br/></p><p>You may also see behavioral signs of disease. This includes lethargy, decreased appetite, or increased respiratory effort/rate. The fish may hold their fins against their body and swim in a ""shimmying"" fashion. Rubbing their body on rocks, or flashing, is a fish behavior utilized to scratch themselves. Severe infestations can cause sudden death. Parasites can spread between fish very quickly, especially in overstocked aquariums and ponds, so your fish may be seeing a variety of symptoms.<br/></p><h2>Treatment for Parasites </h2><p>There is no one treatment for all parasites. There are medications that treat against protozoa and medications for external worms that contain Praziquantel. It is important to have a correct diagnosis to determine if the parasite is a protozoa, worm, or crustacean in order to provide the proper treatment. Most of the time, you will also need to correct any stress issues, such as poor aeration or water quality, in addition to treating the parasite itself. With new fish additions, you may need to limit competition for food, provide additional hiding spaces and avoid squeezing too many fish into one tank. Don't forget to quarantine new fish in a separate quarantine tank before putting them into your aquarium.</p><p>A correct parasite diagnosis should be performed by a qualified veterinarian. Dumping various over-the-counter medications into your aquarium may do nothing for the parasite issue if the correct medication is not used. Never use antibiotics for a parasite infestation. You will only make matters worse by wiping out your biological filtration and not doing anything about the parasite. Consult a fish health expert when you suspect a parasite on your fish to get the correct diagnosis and treatment.</p>",966

It does not include any swim bladder or buoyancy disorders. This disease starts as a collection of very small bubbles, known as microbubbles, that slowly form larger, more visible bubbles. When left untreated, gas bubble disease may cause tissue to degenerate inside the fish, which can be fatal. There are many ways that microbubbles may be invading your aquarium. Changes in water temperature, atmospheric pressure, or improperly functioning filters can all lead to a buildup of bubbles in the tank. In order to successfully treat gas bubble disease, the origin of the microbubbles must be identified and eliminated.</p><h2>What Is Gas Bubble Disease? </h2><p>Gas bubble disease occurs when gasses are supersaturated (dissolved beyond their normal limits) in the water, forming small bubbles that are visible within a fish's eyes, fins, or skin. They may also be present within the internal organs. The gas is most commonly nitrogen, and it can include a collection of small bubbles or coalesce into one or two large bubbles. Carbon dioxide and oxygen bubbles are possible, but these gases are frequently used by fish tissues and readily processed.</p><h3>What is a Gas Bubble?</h3><p>When a gas bubble forms inside a fish, it indicates that the fish has gas bubble disease. The bubbles that you see are usually filled with nitrogen.</p><h2>Symptoms of Gas Bubble Disease in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>Fish owners can typically see the buildup of bubbles inside the tissue of a fish, but poor water clarity is also a sign that gas bubble disease may affect your aquarium. Many bubbles are visible, but the presence of internal microbubbles must be confirmed by an aquatic veterinarian.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Bubbles are visible within the anterior chamber behind the cornea of the eye. Inside the skin, they may present as a visible lump, but sometimes must be felt by moving a hand along the fish. Bubbles can be seen between the fin rays in the clear membrane of the fins. Internal bubbles are not visible and may cause tissue degeneration. It is common to have gas bubbles on both the outside and the inside of fish.</p><p>You may also notice that your water clarity has become cloudy. This can be caused by tiny microbubbles held in suspension throughout the tank. The appearance is similar to a glass of water poured too quickly from a faucet. To test your water for bubbles, collect a sample of the cloudy water and allow it to rest undisturbed for 30-45 minutes. If there is sediment in the water, you will notice a film on the bottom of the glass. If it is microbubbles, the water will become clear, and there may be bubbles adhered to the inside of the glass (which resembles a glass of champagne).</p><h2>Causes of Gas Bubble Disease </h2><p>There are many causes that can introduce microbubbles into your fish system. While gas bubble disease is typically caused by aquarium equipment that is functioning improperly, external factors that change the water temperature or atmospheric pressure may also lead to a buildup of microbubbles within your tank.</p><h2>Diagnosing Gas Bubble Disease in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>Most cases of gas bubble disease can be diagnosed during a physical exam. It is critical to assess all animals within a system that has a potential gas bubble disease episode. An aspirate will be performed to see if the bubble is actually air or clear fluid.</p><p>In order to determine whether there are any internal bubbles, an X-ray or radiograph may be taken of your fish. This procedure usually requires sedation in order to get a good picture.</p><p>Gas bubbles may also be present within gill tissue. This can be seen on a wet mount of the gills, a common aquatic diagnostic procedure.<br/></p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>The most important treatment of gas bubble disease is to determine the cause of the microbubbles within the system and remove them. It may not be a straightforward process, but preventing additional bubbles from developing within your fish is essential.</p><p>Since there are many potential causes, it is critical to eliminate them in order to keep the disease from getting worse. Check the aeration, water pumps, and water flow back into the aquarium, and look for tiny bubbles on plants, décor, or the walls of your tank. Turning off the filter temporarily and checking for new bubbles may help you determine if the filter is causing the gas supersaturation.</p><p>It is also important to evaluate all animals within the system to ensure that all those who are symptomatic are effectively treated. De-aeration of the tank `is very important. Your veterinarian will likely remove the bubbles by aspirating them with a very small needle and syringe. Antibiotic therapy is a common addition to any gas bubble disease treatment protocol. Barometric chambers have been employed in some cases if they are available to your aquatic practitioner.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Gas Bubble Disease </h2><p>Fish that are diagnosed with gas bubble disease can typically recover and enjoy healthy lives with proper treatment. However, the degeneration of internal tissue caused by this disease can be fatal to fish when left untreated. In severe cases, the buildup of bubbles inside the body may prevent fish from performing regular movements and impact buoyancy, causing them to swim upside down. When treated, internal bubbles will dissolve, allowing the fish to return to their normal state.</p><h2>How to Prevent Gas Bubble Disease </h2><p>In order to successfully prevent gas bubble disease, it is important to evaluate all the potential causes and eliminate them from your system. Since plumbing and filtration malfunctions are the most common cause of GBD, start by checking the seals on your aquarium's equipment. Next, maintain suitable water levels by keeping a schedule to add water. Always ensure the temperature remains consistent before introducing fresh water to your tank. This also helps aquarium owners notice leaks early and make any necessary repairs before microbubbles can develop at high levels.</p>",1039

Fish are at higher risk of disease when they have compromised immune function or chronic stress from poor water quality, overcrowding, inappropriate diets, and other poor environmental concerns. These issues need to be addressed or any treatments attempted will only have a temporary effect.</p><p>Recognizing disease in fish can be difficult for newer fish owners. Obvious physical signs, such as spots, lumps, missing scales or frayed fins are the easiest signs of sick fish. More subtle behavioral signs, such as incorrect buoyancy, listing, decreased appetite or increased respiratory effort take more experience to spot. If you are concerned about a fish, call your aquatic veterinarian for more assistance.</p><h2>Parasites </h2><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>There are many different parasites that can affect freshwater fish.</p><p>Most parasites enter fish systems when new fish are introduced to the aquarium. Commonly fish exist with a low level of parasites on them at all times. Their immune system keeps them from getting out of control. When a fish is stressed out from capture, transport and introduction into a foreign system, their immune system is weakened and the parasites can replicate easily. They will then jump to all the fish in your tank and cause flashing, lethargy, decreased appetite, and even death with severe infestations.</p><p>Other clinical signs of a parasite infestation include bruising or missing scales and decreased appetite. Many of these clinical signs can present with other diseases, though, so diagnosis can be tricky.</p><p>Treatment options vary depending on the parasite involved. Most will be temperature-dependent. Your aquatic veterinarian will prescribe the correct treatment following a microscopic diagnosis.</p><h2>Bacteria </h2><p>Jessie Sanders</p><p>Most bacterial infections in fish are secondary to other primary stressors. Typical causes of chronic stress include poor water quality, overcrowding, and inappropriate diet.</p><p>The most common aquatic bacterial infections are caused by and There are also infections, commonly known as fish tuberculosis, which can potentially infect immune-compromised humans. There is no cure for and it requires consultation with an aquatic veterinarian for system maintenance.</p><p>Clinical signs of a bacterial infection include edema of the skin (dropsy), ulceration, decreased appetite, fin erosion, lethargy, secondary fungal or parasitic infections and sudden death.</p><p>., also known as ""cotton wool"" disease, is commonly mistaken for a fungus when it is actually a bacteria.</p><p>Excessive medication with over-the-counter ""antibiotics"" has lead to resistant bacterial strains that require very aggressive treatment. These products also wipe out your biological filtration and lead to New Tank Syndrome, which can compromise your fish even more.</p><p>Before you just dump in a bunch of stuff, consult with an aquatic veterinarian who can recommend an appropriate and effective treatment. They may recommend a bacterial culture and sensitivity testing in order to identify the bacteria causing the problem and the best antibiotic to treat it.</p><h2>Fungal Diseases </h2><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>Fungal diseases are usually found only on dead fish skin. These patches form readily on dead scales, decaying fins, or sites of traumatic injury. They are also found on fish with compromised immune systems due to concurrent viral disease or genetics</p><p>Most fungal infections resolve on their own once the dead skin is removed. Persistent infections may require aggressive therapy coordinated by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Lymphocystis</h2><p>There are a few viral diseases in freshwater fish that can affect common aquarium species. The most common is lymphocystis.</p><p>This is caused by an iridovirus and presents as small white bumps that can be confused with fin ray fractures and White spot disease. Your veterinarian will need to examine your fish in order to distinguish between the various causes of white spots on your fish.</p><h2>Gas Bubble Disease</h2><p>Gas bubble disease is usually caused by very fine microbubbles in your tank. This is commonly caused by a misaligned piece of plumbing or rapid changes in temperature, such as during a water change.</p><p>Clinical signs include bubbles in the skin, fins and eyes. There may be microscopic changes in the gills, which can be examined by your veterinarian under a microscope. You will require veterinary assistance to treat fish with gas bubble disease.</p><h2>Cancer </h2><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>Unfortunately, fish are not immune to various cancers. There are many types that can potentially infect your freshwater fish and it is critical to their health that they are treated as early as possible.</p><p>Most cancers present as abnormal growths on the outside or inside of the fish. You may also see a decrease in appetite, increased lethargy or inability to reproduce.</p><p>If you suspect your fish has cancer, contact your aquatic veterinary ASAP. If caught early enough, some tumors can be surgically removed, greatly improving your fish's quality and length of life.</p><h2>Polycystic Kidney Disease </h2><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>This disease is found in goldfish, one of the most common freshwater aquarium fish. The cause of this disease is unknown, wherein cysts form in the kidneys of the fish, preventing them from working correctly. Your fish's body starts to take on excess water and they start to resemble a water balloon. There is no treatment, other than palliative care, and the disease is unfortunately terminal.</p><p>As with any animal, early detection and effective treatment are key when treating any disease in freshwater fish. Always make sure your fish are in the appropriate environment with good water quality and an adequate diet. Before you attempt any DIY fish treatments, remember that veterinary assistance will likely result in safer and more effective results.</p>",882
112,https://www.thesprucepets.com/freshwater-fish-flashing-5090382,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Flashing in Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Flashing in Aquarium Fish</h1><p>Jessie Sanders</p><p>Flashing is a behavior fish utilize to itch their bodies, most commonly associated with parasitic infections. Since they do not have arms or fingernails, they must use objects in their environment to scratch themselves. You will often see your fish dart suddenly to the side or bottom of their aquarium and flatten out like a pancake, rubbing their side against the substrate. Other signs include fish that exhibit twitchy swimming or swim in sudden bursts. Some fish will jump out of the water and use the tension of the water surface to itch themselves. This is obviously very dangerous if they do not end up back in their tank.</p><p>If you do not see your fish actively flashing, you may see the secondary signs. Signs your fish are itchy include missing scales, bruising or trauma to the head and fins. If the trauma is severe enough, your fish may be susceptible to secondary bacterial or fungal infections and trauma. If left untreated, flashing fish are likely to get worse and can die from the parasitic infestation.</p><h2>Causes of Flashing in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>The most common cause of flashing is a parasitic infestation. The most common parasites in freshwater tanks that cause flashing are monogenean trematodes (also known as flukes), and the protozoa Trichodina, Ichthyophthirius, Costia (Ichthyobodo) and Chilodonella. All of these are microscopic parasites and require a veterinarian to diagnose the correct parasite. The encysted stage of Ich is macroscopic and causes white spots on the skin and fin, and can be confused with fin ray fractures.</p><p>Primary parasite infestations are common in aquariums with recent additions of new fish or live plants that have not gone through a proper quarantine. However, outbreaks can occur in fish under chronic stress situations, such as with poor water quality or overcrowding.</p><p>Fish in the wild commonly have a low level of parasites on them at all times, given the nature of their aquatic habitat, but their immune system is able to keep the parasites in check. In a chronic stress situation, the immune system is weakened, allowing proliferation of parasites and bacteria.</p><p>Some fish are more sensitive to parasites than others. You may see one fish flash occasionally, but this usually does not indicate an outbreak. Multiple fish flashing, or one fish flashing several times in a row, is more concerning.</p><p>Temperature is critical to the progression of a parasite outbreak. The warmer the water, the faster the parasite life cycle and the faster your fish may become overwhelmed. If you suspect a parasite outbreak, do not adjust your temperature until you have consulted with your veterinarian. However, once the correct treatment is prescribed, it is often helpful to elevate the water temperature during treatment.</p><h2>Diagnostic Process </h2><p>In order for your veterinarian to correctly diagnose the cause of flashing in your freshwater fish, they will assess your tank size and number of fish, check the filtration system, perform water quality analysis, and examine your fish, likely under sedation. They may have recommendations to decrease the bioload, or the total number of occupants of your tank, have maintenance protocol recommendations, or tank improvements prior to laying hands on your fish.</p><p>During your fish's physical exam, your veterinarian will take small skin mucus and gill samples. These biopsy samples will be evaluated under a microscope in order to determine if there is a parasite outbreak.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Treatment of flashing depends on the parasite causing the irritation. There are many treatment options to consider depending on the species of fish in your tank, medications already being added to your tank, the severity of the outbreak, and the status of the sick fish. There is no ""one size fits all"" treatment that will guarantee all your fish will magically be cured.</p><p>Some treatments may focus on correcting the primary stressor, such as poor water quality or overcrowding, rather than the parasite itself. In mild outbreaks, once the primary stressor is corrected, the fish will be able to take care of the infestation themselves.</p><h2>How to Prevent Flashing in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>The best method to prevent a parasite outbreak in your freshwater tank is to quarantine all new fish and live plant additions for 4-6 weeks prior to adding them to your main aquarium. This will isolate any potential sick fish and prevent many diseases, including parasites, bacteria and viruses, from entering your healthy system. If your new fish gets sick, they can be quickly and effectively treated while in isolation in the quarantine tank. Quarantine plants in a tank without live fish to break the parasite life cycle.</p><p>If you see your fish flash only occasionally, you have not added any new fish or live plants in the last 3 months, your water quality is within normal range, and you are feeding a good diet, do not be too concerned. Sometimes, a fish may just flash due to a skin irritation, or it has a very low level of parasites that they are able to clear on their own. Make a note of which fish you saw flash and when, and monitor for an increase in severity and any injuries. If you see more flashing, though, it should be investigated and treated before it becomes a problem for other fish in your aquarium.</p>",869
142,https://www.thesprucepets.com/flame-hawkfish-profile-2924951,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Saltwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Flame Hawkfish (Red Hawkfish)</h1>,"<h1>Flame Hawkfish (Red Hawkfish)</h1><h2>Care Information on Neocirrhitus Armatus</h2><p>The flame or red hawkfish is a hale and hardy little fish for most saltwater reef tanks. This fish's vibrant red color, personable nature, and small size make it a highly sought after specimen by aquarium enthusiasts. However, like most hawkfish, it is a predatory bottom-dweller. It likes to sit on top of rocks or corals to keep watch, ready to pounce on any unsuspecting prey that swims too close.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Red hawkfish, brilliant hawkfish, flame hawk</p><p>Adult Size: 3.5 inches (9 centimeters)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>Flame hawkfish hail from the western/central area of the Pacific Ocean. Its territory range is as far northwest as the Ryukyu Islands, and the Great Barrier Reef in the southwest, and the Samoan Islands to the east. This range includes the Philippine Sea, the Coral Sea, and Micronesia. Flame hawkfish are a Pacific species and are not native to the Indian Ocean.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Flame hawkfish get their name for their flame, bright red, or red-orange scales and fins. They have a head-to-tail black stripe down the back that looks like a mohawk. Black also surrounds the eyes in a ring, giving the impression of a hawk bird with black-banded eyes.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>In a reef tank, this fish will most likely take up residence in a hard coral head, perching on top when at ease, and darting down inside the coral head when threatened. It may also take up refuge next to the base or under the tentacles of a large magnificent ritteri anemone or Heteractis magnifica.</p><p>The flame hawk gets along fairly well with other fish but may act aggressively toward other bottom-dwelling species and has been known to swoop down ""like a hawk"" to attack. In a small aquarium this may present a problem, so either avoid other bottom-dwellers or provide this fish with plenty of room and hiding places to ease territorial conflicts.</p><p>Hawkfish are also unafraid to pick on fish that are bigger than themselves and are likely to eat snails, shrimp, and crabs. In short, members of the cleaner crew are on the menu of this fish.</p><p>They quickly come to control the substrate around their territory and keep other fish at bay. They can also act as referees by rushing in and breaking up fights between other fish. They are usually quite tolerant of fish that swim higher in the water column, and those that avoid their territory.</p><h2>Flame Hawkfish Habitat and Care </h2><p>Flame hawkfish are happiest as bottom-dwellers. They live in areas where coral heads and stones are present to perch upon and hide in. It will normally be close to a convenient place to dart into and hide when any threats approach it. The fish prefer coral that is a similar color to its body as a way to provide cover or camouflage. Hawkfish are an extremely hardy and disease-resistant species able to adapt to a wide range of aquarium conditions. It is suggested that you provide the flame hawkfish with constantly moving, oxygenated water in the reef aquarium. It may lose its vibrant red color in the aquarium if not provided with proper nutrition.</p><h2>Flame Hawkfish Diet </h2><p>The flame hawkfish is a carnivore with a diet preference for small crustaceans, some sessile invertebrates (immovable, like coral), and invertebrates that can move. It will eat feather dusters and ornamental shrimp, as well as may pick hermit crabs and snails right out of their shells. Even though fish are not a preferred food source, they may try and eat smaller fish if the opportunity arises.</p><p>This fish can be a very finicky eater, and in captivity, some specimens may have a tendency to not want to eat at all. We found that most would adapt pretty well, while others would just ignore tank fed fares. With persistence and patience, stubborn feeders can eventually figure out that the dried shrimp, flake foods, and other meaty fares being provided are food. This fish can be fed a daily diet of crustacean and fish flesh, mysid shrimp, and other fresh or frozen meaty fares suitable for marine carnivores.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Hawkfish are protogynous or sequential hermaphrodites, which means all individuals are born female. Basically, when a group of females exists in the absence of a male, the most dominant changes sex and becomes the male. Typically, the male then exerts control over the group and mates with all of the females. By and large, hawkfish reproduce in a harem-type way. Males are larger than females.</p><h2>Breeding the Flame Hawkfish </h2><p>Flame hawkfish perform their courtship and spawning rituals at or right after dusk near the surface in the open water. The female releases a large number of buoyant eggs that are promptly fertilized by the male. The fertilized eggs float away on water currents. They do not guard their offspring. Hatching is believed to occur after roughly three weeks.</p><h2>Unique Characteristic </h2><p>While they have very strong pectoral fins they are not good swimmers. These fish lack a swim bladder, which would otherwise help keep them buoyant. These fish seem to push themselves through the water instead of swimming. This should be taken into consideration when keeping them with much larger fast-swimming fish that could see them as a potential meal. When these fish are perched on top of rocks they will use their strong pectoral fins to ""walk across"" the rock instead of swim across.</p>",883
66,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fish-mouth-types-1381813,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Fish Mouth Types and Their Uses</h1>,"<h1>Fish Mouth Types and Their Uses</h1><p>Fish mouths come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and orientations, each of which tells a great deal about what and where the fish eats, as well as something about its behavior. Predatory fish generally have the largest mouths, often sporting long, sharp teeth. Some species have mouths that can be extended, allowing the fish to lengthen its effective reach to catch tasty morsels of food as it swims. Other species have specialized mouthparts that allow them to rasp algae off rocks and branches. And additional fish have mouths with teeth in the back, nearly in their throat. These pharyngeal teeth assist in holding and swallowing prey.</p><h2>Superior Mouth </h2><p>The superior mouth is oriented upwards, and the lower jaw is longer than the upper jaw. Usually, fish with this type of mouth feed at the surface. They lie in wait for prey to appear above them, then strike suddenly from below.</p><p>Many species of fish with a superior mouth feed largely on insects, however, some may feed on other fish that swim near the surface. Some species with a superior mouth have an elongated lower jaw that functions much like a scoop.</p><p>Archers, half-beaks, and hatchetfish are all examples of species of aquarium fish that have a superior mouth.</p><h2>Terminal Mouth </h2><p>Terminal mouths are located in the middle of the head and point forward. Both jaws are the same length. More fish have this mouth type than any other. Fish having a terminal mouth are generally mid-water feeders; however, they can feed at any location. These species of fish are often omnivores, eating anything that is available. They typically feed on the move, either grabbing bits of food that they pass or preying on other fish that they chase down.</p><p>It is quite common for fish with a terminal mouth to also have a protrusible mouth which allows them to thrust the jaw forward when grabbing food. Most fish that feed on other fish have terminal mouths, which are often hinged to allow them to accommodate the action of snatching and swallowing another fish. They may also possess specialized teeth, and in some cases an additional jaw. Moray eels are one type of species that have a pharyngeal jaw placed well back in their throat.</p><p>Most barbs, cichlids, gouramis, and tetras have terminal mouths.</p><h2>Inferior Mouth </h2><p>Also called a sub-terminal or ventral mouth, the inferior mouth is turned downward. The lower jaw is shorter than the upper jaw, and the jaw will often be protrusible. Fish with inferior mouths are usually bottom feeders and often possess barbels that assist in locating food particles.</p><p>Most members of the catfish family have inferior jaws, and many of them also have a sucker mouth as well. The diet of fish with inferior mouths includes algae, invertebrates (such as snails), as well as detritus, and any food that falls to the bottom.</p><h2>Protrusible Mouth </h2><p>A protrusible mouth allows a fish to extend its reach when attempting to snatch prey or food particles. This feature can be seen in all mouth types. Fish with a protrusible and hinged terminal mouth can create a vacuum when they open their mouths, thus sucking in their prey. Various species of fish may use a protrusible mouth while chasing down prey, while other species quietly lie in wait for prey to pass by, then rapidly extend the mouth to snatch the hapless victim. </p><p>Some species use this feature to engage in non-feeding activities. For example, kissing gourami uses its protrusible mouth to defend territory against others of the same species. Although it may appear to be kissing the other gourami, it is a combative move to show its opponent who owns that space.</p><p>Other species, such as some members of the sucker catfish family, use a protrusible mouth to stay in place by attaching to a rock or other stationary object.</p><h2>Sucker Mouth </h2><p>Sucker mouths are a common feature in fish with inferior mouths. Catfish, such as the popular plecostomus (which literally translates to folded mouth), use a sucker mouth to rasp algae off driftwood or rocks. Some species use a sucker mouth to hold on to help them combat currents. By attaching itself to rock via its sucker mouth, it can stay where it wishes, even in a strong current.</p><p>These sucker mouths are also protrusible, which allows the fish to extend its reach when sifting through the substrate for food particles. Sucker mouths can also be used when defending territory or quarreling with another fish.</p><h2>Elongated Mouth </h2><p>A greatly elongated snout is another kind of mouth adaptation. This type of mouth allows the fish to poke into small crevices and holes to find food. They may also use this mouth to dig through the substrate to reach buried food treasures. Some surface-feeding fish also has an elongated mouth that allows them to scoop insects and food particles from the surface.</p><p>Freshwater species with elongated mouths include the halfbeaks, gars, and pencilfish. Saltwater species include the needlefish and fish in the wrasse family.</p><h2>Beak Mouth </h2><p>The beak mouth is an interesting, but less common, mouth variation; it's also known as a rostrum. In this design, the mouth consists of two very hard pieces that are hinged and come together in a scissor-like fashion. This allows them to crush hard shells of invertebrates.</p><p>Pufferfish, both freshwater and saltwater species, and Saltwater parrotfish possess a beak-type mouth.</p><p>Fish Observations</p><p>Moray Eels Are Uniquely Equipped To Pack Big Prey Into Their Narrow Bodies. </p><p>Channel Catfish.</p><p>Suckermouth Catfish .</p>",880

This fish's bright colors make it stand out. Owners of this fish say that it has tons of personality. The name ""dartfish"" comes from this fish's habit of darting quickly back into hiding whenever it feels threatened or frightened. It spends its days flitting around the aquarium, then suddenly diving into cover. It is an inhabitant of reefs where it can be found at depths from 20 to 230 feet. It is usually found just above the bottom, facing into the current, where it awaits its prey of small invertebrates.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Firefish goby, fire goby, magnificent or fire dartfish</p><p>Adult Size: 3 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Natural Distribution </h2><p>The firefish goby is native to the Indian and Pacific oceans from the eastern coast of Africa to the Hawaiian Islands and from the Austral Islands north to the Ryukyu Islands. In the wild, this fish can be found in groups hovering above the reef, close to its numerous hiding places, feeding on the planktonic food that drifts by in the current.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>A firefish goby is a long, slender fish. Its face is yellow, its front half is white, its rear half is red. The dorsal, anal, and caudal fins are highlighted in black. The first spine in the first dorsal fin is greatly elongated and may be as long as the fish itself. This elongated dorsal fin is used to signal other firefish as well as used a ""locking device"" similar to the triggerfish. This locking device allows the firefish to lock itself into a crevice using its dorsal fin to prevent a predator from pulling it out of a crevice.</p><p>The firefish goby has a swim bladder, which allows it to hover in one location for extended periods with its head pointed upwards. </p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>The firefish goby is a near-perfect reef tank fish as it doesn't bother other fish, corals, or invertebrates commonly found in a reef tank. It may become territorial if it is crowded in a small aquarium (particularly with members of its own species). Though it may take them some time to become comfortable and active, they often act as ""dither fish"" and their activity can encourage other shy fish to come out into the open more often. Unless it is part of a mated pair, this fish may quarrel with other fish of the same species.</p><p>Potential tankmates may include two gobies of the same species, clownfish, or shrimp gobies. Slow-moving, timid tankmates are recommended. Gobies are easily eaten by triggers, lionfish, and large angelfish.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>Because of its small size it can be kept in some nano aquariums, but a larger aquarium size is suggested for this fish because of its darting nature. There should be a strong water flow. Provide at least a minimum of two square feet of bottom surface area per couple, if you stock more than two. Most dartfish are too-easily lost by hobbyists because of simple mistakes. Some jump out due to poorly secured aquarium covers. For this reason, house your firefish in an aquarium with a tightly fitting lid. The next largest cause of loss is likely due to stress, damage, and outright predation by inappropriate tankmates. Following closely behind is a lack of nutrition or out-competition for foods. </p><p>When the firefish goby is first introduced into an aquarium it may hide for days, making the owner think it has totally disappeared or is dead somewhere in the live rock. But, once it feels comfortable with its new surroundings, it will come out to chase down small scraps of food with the rest of the fish in the aquarium. Not an aggressive feeder, care should be taken to make sure that it is getting enough food. These fish are resistant to disease and usually can adapt well to aquarium life.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>Firefish gobies are omnivores. Along with algae and zooplankton growing in the tank, a firefish goby's diet should include meaty foods, including mysis shrimp, brine shrimp, finely chopped fresh or frozen seafood, and vitamin-enriched prepared foods. Because they have relatively small guts, feed this dartfish 2-3 times daily to ensure good nutrition.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>This species does not seem to have any unique identifying characteristics between the genders, although females tend to be smaller and thinner.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>This is a monogamous species. This fish should be kept solo unless the tank is very large, or in mated pairs. Very little is known about the mating habits of this species, although, most assume its habits are similar to other goby species and they lay eggs on a substrate.</p><p>Hunziker, Ray.

92,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fin-rot-1378481,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Fin Rot in Aquarium Fish</h1>,"<h1>Fin Rot in Aquarium Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Fin rot is one of the most common diseases in aquarium fish, but it is also one of the most preventable. Technically, fin rot is caused by several different species of bacteria, but the root cause is usually environmental in nature and is often related to stress, which can weaken a fish's immune system. When fish are moved, kept in a tank with poor water conditions, subjected to overcrowding, or coupled with aggressive fish that chase them and nip at their fins, they are more susceptible to fin rot.</p><p>Fin rot can affect any type of aquarium fish, both freshwater and saltwater. While all species of fish are susceptible, fin rot is easiest to spot on fish with long, flowing fins, such as betta fish, angelfish, and many fancy goldfish. Due to the long length and delicacy of their fins, these fish are likeliest to suffer an injury that makes them susceptible to fin rot.</p><p>As the name suggests, the infection attacks the fins and tail of the fish, causing color changes, deterioration, and eventually, the loss of the fins and tail, which is life-threatening to your fish. Luckily, with treatment and tank maintenance, your fish can recover from this unsightly condition.</p><h2>What Is Fin Rot? </h2><p>There are many bacteria in a fish tank's water. Most of the time, these bacteria don't harm your fish, as the fishes' immune systems ward off infection. In fact, bacteria play an important role in the overall health of your aquarium ecosystem. However, when a fish is stressed, the immune system can be weakened, allowing bacteria to take hold and cause disease. The bacteria species likeliest to cause fin rot are , or bacteria.</p><h2>Symptoms of Fin Rot in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>In the early stages of fin rot, the edges of the fins will discolor, appearing milky on the edges. Often this change is so subtle that it goes unnoticed until fraying of the fins or tail begins. As the infection spreads, small pieces of the fins die and begin to fall off, leaving a ragged edge.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Over time, the fins and tail become shorter and shorter as dead flesh continues to slough off the infected areas. The affected fins may become red and inflamed, including around the base of the fins, as more tissue is eaten away.</p><p>As your fish becomes more ill, it is likely to stop eating and become lethargic. This displays as less movement than usual or drifting near the bottom of the tank.</p><p>It is not unusual for sick fish to develop secondary bacterial infections. One such disease is columnaris, which is caused by another bacteria commonly found in fish tanks. If your fish is stricken by this bacteria as well as the fin rot, you'll notice cottony spots on the fish's fins and/or body along with the typical fin rot symptoms.</p><h2>Causes of Fin Rot </h2><p>The direct cause of fin rot is infection with bacteria. However, the indirect cause of this condition is some type of stress that lowered the infected fish's immune system enough to allow the bacteria to take hold. There are many common causes of stress in aquarium fish.</p><h2>Diagnosing Fin Rot in Aquarium Fish </h2><p>Fin rot can generally be diagnosed by the characteristic symptoms. If you see your fish developing progressively frayed fins and tail, particularly if the skin at the base of the fins is reddened, then you are dealing with fin rot. However, if you are uncertain, it is always best to consult with an aquatic veterinarian. They will test samples of your aquarium water for chemical imbalances that can cause stress and can generally diagnose your fish with fin rot based on its symptoms.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>You must address the causes of the stress that led to the fin rot before your fish can heal. Start by testing the aquarium water. Check the pH and temperature of the water, and make sure they are appropriate for your fish species. Be sure there isn't excessive chlorine, ammonia, or nitrite in the water, and that the nitrate is under 40 ppm (mg/L).</p><p>A water change of up to 25 percent can be helpful in restoring healthy water balance, as can vacuuming the gravel substrate to remove food and waste debris. Take care to avoid overfeeding in the future.</p><p>Start putting dates on your fish food, as it loses the vitamin content fairly quickly after the food container is opened. Feeding your fish fresh, high-quality food in smaller quantities is far better than frequent, large feedings of stale foods.</p><p>Once the cause of stress is corrected, antibiotics will usually cure the disease itself. Treatment with a drug that is effective against gram-negative organisms is recommended. Although there are antibiotics and other treatments for sale in most aquarium shops, it's a good idea to consult with an aquatic veterinarian if you are uncertain as to the best antibiotic for your fish.</p><p>Always treat according to your veterinarian's specific directions, or follow the guidelines on the antibiotic packaging. Typically, you'll add a certain amount of antibiotic to the aquarium water based on the size of the tank. It's best to remove or turn off activated carbon filters during the treatment, as the carbon will otherwise absorb the medication. It is particularly important to continue treatment for the length of time recommended, as ending treatment too soon can result in a recurrence of the infection.</p><h2>Prognosis for Aquarium Fish with Fin Rot </h2><p>If you take steps to remedy poor water conditions in your fish tank, alleviate other common causes of stress, and dose your fish with the appropriate antibiotic, your fish has an excellent chance of recovering completely from fin rot. Generally, you'll see the fins begin to heal within a couple of weeks after starting treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Fin Rot </h2><p>Many of the measures to prevent fin rot are the same preliminary steps used to treat fish that have the disease. The best prevention against fin rot is good aquarium maintenance. Change the water regularly, vacuum the gravel, and monitor the water chemistry by having a regular testing schedule and documenting the results. This will allow you to quickly notice water chemistry changes that occur over time, giving you a chance to correct problems before they become serious.</p><p>When feeding, keep the quantity low. Only feed the fish as much food as they will consume in about five minutes, twice daily. Overfeeding is the most common mistake made by all fish owners, and contributes to the poor water quality that fosters bacteria. Purchase food in containers small enough that they can be used up in one to two months.</p><p>Do not overcrowd the tank, and watch for signs of fighting between fish that may damage fins. Take care when choosing tank mates for fish that have long flowing fins, as fin-nipping leaves fish more susceptible to fin rot. It is also important to keep water at the optimal temperature for your tank inhabitants.</p>",1153

Although flake food is a good staple diet with balanced vitamins and minerals for fish, the vast majority of freshwater fish would literally jump at the chance to have live or even frozen foods.</p><h2>Flake Food </h2><p>Before we dive into the topic of live food, let's talk about flake foods. Realistically, it's not possible for most of us to provide a completely balanced diet composed of only fresh and frozen foods. Flake food is accepted by a large number of freshwater fish and contains important nutrients your fish needs to stay healthy. However, not all flake foods are created equal.</p><p>The next time you purchase flake food take a good look at the ingredients label on the container. What you'll find is fishmeal, yeast, shrimp meal, algae, plankton, kelp, vitamins, minerals, preservatives, and fillers such as wheat meal, soybean meal, oatmeal, and brown rice. Those last items are necessary to provide the binding of ingredients but don't contain the same nutrients and flavor found in shrimp, fish or other food the wild fish would eat.</p><p>Remember that ingredients are listed in order of highest volume first, so look for prepared foods that have fishmeal and seafood high on the ingredient list. Once you select a quality flake food, start looking for ways to supplement those boring flakes with fresh or frozen foods.</p><p>Also, vitamins in flake foods have a limited storage life, so you should buy food in a quantity that will be used in about a month. If it will take longer to use up the flake food, try storing it in the refrigerator or even freezer to keep it nutritious longer.</p><h2>The Tubifex Controversy </h2><p>Tubifex worms have long been heralded as either the worst or the best live food to feed your fish. They are very nutritious and easy to grow at home but can be purchased at many local fish stores. The controversy comes from the risk of them carrying diseases to your home aquarium</p><p>Like earthworms (which eat dirt), tubifex are annelid worms that eat whatever material they are raised in. Brace yourself most commercially raised tubifex worms are raised in trout pond run-offs, which means they live on fish manure. Needless to say, that makes them potential hotbeds for transmitting bacterial or parasitic infections. Disgusting? Yes! But freshwater fish love tubifex worms and thrive on them if they are cleaned properly. So how can you ensure they are safe to feed your fish?</p><p>Start by purchasing your live tubifex worms from a reputable store, then carefully examine the water in which they are kept. It should be clear. If it isn't, don't purchase them. When you find clean worms, place them in a large container of dechlorinated water, and 3 to 4 times a day rinse them thoroughly until the water runs clear. Store them in the refrigerator and examine the water each morning. If the water is clear they are clean and can be used to feed your fish. Don't feed them to your fish until the water is clear, so continue to rinse them as needed.</p><p>The quality of tubifex will vary from store to store, so if you locate good ones (worms that clean quickly as opposed to ones who are still fouling the water after many days) make note of the supplier. If you find healthy, clean worms, you can start your own colony of tubifex worms by growing them in an aerated tank with an inch of gravel on the bottom and then add small amounts of vegetables (slices of sweet potato are good) or aquarium plant trimmings for food. As they multiply, siphon or net out the worms to feed to your fish.</p><p>Almost as good as feeding live tubifex worms, most pet stores sell frozen or even freeze-dried tubifex worms. These forms of tubifex are safe to feed your fish without having to do any cleaning.</p><h2>Brine Shrimp </h2><p>One of the best live foods is , more commonly known as brine shrimp. If you've looked around for live brine shrimp you've probably discovered they are a bit pricey, or difficult to find at all. Don't give up. Most fish shops carry a good selection of frozen brine shrimp. The texture and flavor of brine shrimp will vary based on what they were fed and how they are frozen.</p><p>Much like people, fish have distinct preferences when it comes to food. Don't hesitate to try several brands to find the one your fish likes the best. Regardless of whether you try frozen or live , you will be surprised to see how voraciously even small fish will consume them.</p><p>Many fish stores sell dried brine shrimp eggs, and even kits for hatching and raising live brine shrimp at home. Newly hatched brine shrimp are a perfect starter food for baby fish (fry) of many species. They are relatively easy to grow at home. Once grown, the brine shrimp will continue to reproduce so you can keep a culture going and have shrimp of all sizes to meet the needs of your fish. Because brine shrimp live in saltwater, they do not carry the parasites that might spread to your freshwater fish.</p><h2>Other Live Foods </h2><p>Shrimp aren't the only ""safe"" live food available. Experts consider Daphnia, AKA water fleas, one of the top live food choices. They carry none of the diseases that tubifex do, are an excellent source of nutrition for all fish, and can be raised fairly easily at home.</p><p>Daphnia are not commonly found at fish stores, but local fish clubs can usually supply you with a starter colony. The best part of offering Daphnia is the fact that since they are freshwater organisms, they can live in the aquarium until the fish eat them. Once your fish have gotten the taste of the ""good stuff,"" you'll find yourself searching for an even wider variety of live foods. There are plenty of options.</p><h2>Frozen Alternatives </h2><p>If live food isn't available, is too costly, or is too much of a hassle to raise, frozen foods are a good alternative. Brine shrimp is the top-selling frozen food, but you shouldn't limit your fish to only shrimp (even steak gets boring after a while). There are many other frozen foods available, and some even combine several popular foods into a single mix that fish find very appealing.</p><p>Spend a little time in the freezer section of your fish store. You won't find any Macadamia Nut ice cream, but you will find everything from krill, to kelp, to red algae. Wait, aren't algae and kelp plants? They sure are. Don't forget that even meat-eating fish will enjoy plants and vegetables. In fact, some vegetarians, such as the plecostomus and other algae eaters, will also eat meat-containing fish foods.</p><p>You can satisfy the vegetarians with frozen kelp, freeze-dried algae strips, or bits of fresh Romaine lettuce and spinach. The next time you make a salad, wash the greens well and try feeding a small portion to your fish. You might be surprised to see which ones dig into it. What your mother told you about veggies being good for you holds true for your fish too. Fresh vegetables provide vitamins and roughage often lacking in other fish foods.</p><p>Whether it's live or frozen, animal or vegetable, your fish will enjoy having a variety of foods offered to them. Remember, you are the only chef they have.</p>",1239
118,https://www.thesprucepets.com/dropsy-in-aquarium-fish-1381806,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Dropsy in Fish </h1>,"<h1>Dropsy in Fish </h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Dropsy (sometimes called bloat) is not a disease but a condition caused by an underlying health issue like an infection, parasites, or liver dysfunction. It involves the accumulation of fluid in a fish's body, giving it a swollen or bloated appearance. Often exacerbated by environmental stressors, dropsy should resolve when the stress is relieved and the underlying illness is treated. Of course, the prognosis depends on the severity of the illness and its response to treatment.<br/></p><h2>What Is Dropsy? </h2><p>Dropsy refers to a condition in which fluid accumulates in a fish's body. Technically referred to as edema or ascites, dropsy is a sign of malfunctioning kidneys and/or gills due to an underlying health issue.<br/></p><h2>Symptoms of Dropsy in Fish </h2><p>Depending on the underlying cause of kidney and/or gill malfunction, you may see a variety of physical symptoms. Dropsy, as an isolated condition, is associated with various forms of swelling.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Swollen Belly </h3><p>A fish with dropsy experiences rapid abdominal swelling, distinguishing the condition from weight gain or pregnancy. All of the internal organs will eventually become swollen and stop functioning. The fluid accumulation is caused by the inability of the kidneys and/or gills to eliminate water from the body, which is a result of the underlying health problem.</p><h3>Protruding Scales </h3><p>The internal swelling of dropsy causes a fish's scales to protrude and point away from the skin, giving the fish a ""pine cone"" appearance. Protruding scales may be present all over the body or only on parts.</p><h3>Bulging Eyes </h3><p>Swollen eyes indicate the presence of excess fluid that can't be eliminated from the body. The fluid causes pressure behind the eyeball, resulting in exophthalmia, usually bilaterally (both eyes).</p><h3>Pale Gills </h3><p>Excess fluid in a fish's body can cause its gills to distend and appear pale. Pale gills are associated with many diseases in fish and may be a result of the primary stressor or disease, not just dropsy.</p><h3>Increased Respiratory Rate </h3><p>To ""breathe"" oxygen, a fish inhales water, and oxygen is assimilated via the gills. If the gills are not functioning properly, the fish must work harder to take oxygen into its tissues. This effort is evident in a faster-than-normal respiratory rate.</p><h3>Swollen Anus </h3><p>If excess fluid is unable to leave a fish's body, it may build up in the intestines, causing internal and external swelling that may be seen in the anus.<br/></p><h3>Redness of Skin or Fins </h3><p>As a fish's skin is stretched with excess fluid, small blood vessels may pop and pool in the skin and fins.</p><h2>Causes of Dropsy </h2><p>With chronic stress, a fish becomes vulnerable to infections. Generally, a single or short-term exposure to stress, known as acute stress, will not compromise a fish's ability to fight infection. In cases of illness, stress exposure usually occurs for an extended time.</p><h2>Diagnosing Dropsy in Fish </h2><p>If you notice signs of dropsy in one or more fish, call your veterinarian for help. Your fish has a better chance of recovery if you get a correct diagnosis and treatment early in its disease.</p><p>Your veterinarian will evaluate your fish's physical symptoms and the aquarium environment, which may include water quality testing. Poor water quality is one of the most common causes of illnesses that involve dropsy. Learning to test water quality in an easy way to keep your aquatic environment in good health and prevent stress in your fish. </p><p>Dropsy is easy to identify by the swelling of a fish's body, but your veterinarian will also help identify the underlying cause and recommend targeted treatment.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>With all fish illnesses, prompt diagnosis and treatment better a fish's chances of recovery. Treatment of dropsy must be geared toward correcting the underlying problem and providing supportive care to the sick fish.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Dropsy </h2><p>Since it is a symptom and not a disease, dropsy is dependent on the state of a fish's underlying illness and will resolve if that illness can be successfully treated. Dropsy can be fatal due to the advanced stage of the underlying disease causing excessive swelling that leads to organ failure.</p><h2>How to Prevent Dropsy </h2><p>As with all diseases, prevention is the best medicine. Preventing chronic stress in fish is the best method to prevent dropsy. Because poor water quality is the most common root cause of stress, routine tank maintenance is critical.</p><p>Although taking all these steps cannot guarantee a dropsy-free system, they will go a long way to ensure the health and longevity of all your fish.</p>",733

This bacteria is commonly mistaken for a fungus, given its pale color and raised appearance. It can infect most species of freshwater fish but is usually secondary to another primary stressor. Some strains are more deadly and contagious than others.</p><h2>What is Cotton Wool Disease? </h2><p>Cotton wool disease is caused by the bacteria . It is not a fungus, despite its fungus-like appearance. It can infect the skin and gills and is of great importance to the commercial aquaculture market. It is rarer in the pet fish community. It is mostly an opportunistic pathogen that takes advantage of a stressed fish with a compromised immune system. There are many strains within the species, some of which are significantly more deadly and spread more easily.</p><h2>Symptoms of Cotton Wool Disease in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>The signs of cotton wool disease are usually noticeable since they are visible, but can often be confused for other fish maladies. The development of fluffy appearing skin patches will be the most obvious sign of the disease.<br/></p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Skin Patches </h3><p>The most common clinical sign of cotton wool disease is a pale, raised patch on your fish's skin. It can be anywhere on the body, including the face, mouth, and fins. These lesions typically have a fluffy appearance similar to a fungal growth.</p><h3>Pale Gills </h3><p>In some instances, these skin patches can spread to the gills. The gill tissue may then appear necrotic or pale when examined.</p><h3>Lethargy </h3><p>As the bacteria replicates and spreads throughout your fish's system, your pet will feel stressed and lethargic.</p><h3>Difficulty Swimming </h3><p>The spreading illness and patches can cause your fish to lose its equilibrium and cause it to have difficulty swimming.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite </h3><p>A sick fish often experiences a loss of appetite.</p><h2>Causes of Cotton Wool Disease </h2><p>Columnaris bacteria are commensal bacteria and occur naturally on healthy fish. The fish begin to show clinical signs if it is stressed out or if the strain of bacteria is particularly nasty. The bacteria commonly enters a healthy system when infected fish are added to the tank without the proper quarantine. It is critical to keep a close eye on your tank's temperature, since columnaris bacteria love warmer water (around 80 degrees Fahrenheit) which will cause problems faster than if they were present in cooler water.</p><h2>Diagnosing Cotton Wool Disease in Freshwater Fish </h2><p>It is critical to differentiate columnaris species from a fungal infection. To do so, your veterinarian will take a small biopsy from a sedated fish and place it under a microscope. If it is indeed cotton wool disease, the bacteria rods will form themselves into tiny haystacks, whereas fungus will not and the individual hyphae (branching filaments that are parts of a fungus) may be distinct.</p><p>Additional testing may be warranted by sending a swab sample to a lab to identify its strain and understand which antibiotics will be most effective. Never ""guess"" with antibiotic treatment. You may end up wiping out your biologic filtration and using the incorrect product or dose, breeding more resistant strains in your system.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>All fish showing symptoms should be isolated into a hospital tank. Your veterinarian will prescribe an antibiotic to be added to the water or provide an injectable treatment. Injectable antibiotics will not affect your biological filter and they provide a stronger treatment option. Never attempt to inject your fish yourself.</p><p>Your fish may require different antibiotics if no sample is sent for culture and sensitivity testing. A detailed history of your fish including what treatments have already been attempted is critical to deciding which antibiotic is best for your situation.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Cotton Wool Disease </h2><p>Severely sick fish, including those with greater than 50 percent of the gill tissue affected, may require euthanasia. It is very hard for fish to recover from such a severe infection. If your fish's gills have become infected, it is critical to give them additional oxygen support from an airstone.</p><p>Since it is a secondary invader, your fish system should be assessed for any potential stressors. This includes testing your water chemistry, reviewing your fish's diet, comparing fish compatibility, and examining any recent additions of fish or decor. If you do not remove the primary cause, your fish will get sick again after finishing treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Cotton Wool Disease </h2><p>As with most diseases, cotton wool disease can be prevented with proper quarantine. Take these steps to keep cotton wool disease out of your tank.</p>",762

However, this technicality doesn't stop the coral banded shrimp from being incredibly popular among many aquarists. Not only do they add beautiful color to your tank, but they are also incredibly easy to take care of.</p><h2>Scientific Names </h2><p>This group of shrimps includes (Red and White Banded Coral Shrimp), (Golden Coral Shrimp), (Yellow Banded Coral Shrimp), (Blue or Purple Banded Coral Shrimp).</p><h2>Other Common Names </h2><p>Coral Banded Shrimps, and Banded Prawns.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>The Coral Banded Shrimp species vary in size from two to four inches in length with the male being the smaller of a mated pair.</p><h2>Distribution </h2><p>Tropical seas throughout the Indo-Pacific region and the Caribbean.</p><h2>Identification </h2><p>All Banded Coral Shrimps are marked with the characteristic bright red and white bands on their body and pincer claws, with the legs and antennae being white, except for the species which are red. The front pair of legs are equipped with a pair of pincers which are larger than the pincers on the second pair of legs. The third pair of legs have no pincers. The Coral Banded Shrimp will regrow lost legs during its next molt.</p><p>The coloration of the shrimp's carapace is where species differ as the is white.</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>gets along well with most fish and invertebrates (see exceptions, below) in an aquarium. However, triggerfish and many eels will dine on Coral Banded Shrimp when given the opportunity. In the wild, this shrimp prefers to live in caves and on the bottom of overhangs and will actively clean fish, when presented with parasites.</p><p>In the wild, the Coral Banded Shrimp is nocturnal, hiding under ledges and in caves during the day and feeding at night. These shrimps live in monogamy and are somewhat territorial, defending an area of one to two meters in diameter against other crustaceans and in particular other Coral Banded Shrimps. If another Coral Banded Shrimp enters its territory, it will defend it, with one or the other shrimp losing legs and pincers in the battle that will follow.</p><p>During mating, the male will first display a courtship dance in front of the female. The male then transfers a sperm sack to the freshly molted female which soon will inseminate the eggs and stick them to the abdominal legs. The young hatch after 16 days. The hatchlings will be attached to their mother for about six weeks before they detach, float to the surface of the water and become part of the plankton and drifting in the ocean currents. After some weeks and several molts, the young descend from the plankton and settle to the bottom and find a dark place to hide. The Coral Banded Shrimp may live 2 to 3 years, sometimes longer.</p><p>Back when we used to collect and ship tropical fish on the island of Moloka'i, we always knew that we could find Coral Banded Shrimp in numbers at night, hanging on the vertical walls of the wharf. If we needed mated pairs (in high demand on the Mainland) we would have to find pairs of shrimp that were within a foot or so from each other. We would collect them and keep them together in a cup before shipping them the next morning. It seems that the Coral Banded Shrimps mate at a young age and when one of the pair becomes lost the remaining shrimp will not accept another mate.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>is a scavenger by nature and will take most meaty foods. Will readily devour Polychaete Worms when they are present. In the wild, this shrimp will feed on algae, detritus, and carrion as well as parasites which it picks from fish.</p><h2>Aquarium Suitability </h2><p>It is aggressive towards other shrimp and crustaceans. It also preys on worms, snails and small hermit crabs. Being a nocturnal animal, the Coral Banded Shrimp greatly prefers the protection of a cave or overhang during the day. In an aquarium, they do best if they have a place to hide during the day.</p><p>Shrimps in general and Coral Banded Shrimps, in particular, are very sensitive to shifts in water chemistry, with drastic changes in pH being a prime killer when putting a shrimp into an aquarium. For this reason, take your time when acclimating shrimps. The drip line method seems to work the best for increasing survival.</p>",726
65,https://www.thesprucepets.com/betta-common-questions-1380780,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Commonly Asked Questions About Bettas</h1>,"<h1>Commonly Asked Questions About Bettas</h1><p>Bettas are one of the most popular and easily recognizable freshwater aquarium fish. These FAQs cover the most commonly asked questions about them, including why they sometimes spit out their food.</p><h2>What Is a Siamese Fighting Fish? </h2><p>Siamese fighting fish is a name often used to refer to betta fish in general, but the name is specific to the species , which is the species most often sold in stores.</p><h2>Species of Betta </h2><p>There are approximately 70 species of , a genus in the gourami family (Osphronemidae), but almost all of those sold in pet stores are the species .</p><h2>Colors of Betta </h2><p>Bettas are available in a wide variety of colors, including red, blue, orange, yellow, green, purple, brown, white and black. They may be solid, bicolored, multicolored, marbled, piebald, or variegated. There are many fin types as well.</p><h2>How Long Bettas Usually Live </h2><p>Bettas typically live for about two to five years, but they can live longer than that with good care. Male bettas may be as old as a year when they're sold in shops, allowing for full color and fin development. Female bettas are generally about six months old when they're offered for sale.</p><h2>What Do Bettas Eat? </h2><p>Bettas are carnivores. They require foods high in animal protein. Their preferred diet in nature includes insects and insect larvae. In captivity, they thrive on a varied diet of pellets or flakes made from fish meal, as well as frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms. Live brine shrimp and bloodworms make an excellent supplemental food on occasion and are ideal when you're conditioning breeding pairs.</p><h2>What If the Betta Refuses to Eat or Spits Out Its Food?  </h2><p>It isn't uncommon for fish to not eat when they're first brought home. This is particularly true for bettas who have a reputation for being picky eaters. Feed small portions of a variety of foods, and eventually, your fish will eat. Don't be alarmed if the betta spits out its food. This, too, is common behavior and it's believed to be a mechanism for breaking down and softening the food. Try some live bloodworms or live brine shrimp as treats if all else fails, either one will almost always entice your betta into eating. Take care to avoid feeding live foods too often, however, or your betta may begin to refuse to eat anything else.</p><h2>Can a Betta Be Kept in a Vase? </h2><p>Bettas should not be kept in a plant vase, because they require good water quality and warm water temperatures to thrive. Those conditions are more readily provided by keeping them in a filtered and heated aquarium.</p><h2>Water Temperature for a Betta </h2><p>Bettas should be in water that is between 76 and 81 degrees Fahrenheit for optimal health. When you're breeding bettas, the water temperature should be above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Bettas will become lethargic as water temperatures get lower, particularly when the temperature drops below 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>How Often Should the Water Be Changed? </h2><p>The water should be changed every other day if the betta is in a small container that isn't filtered. Weekly partial water changes are recommended if kept in a filtered tank. It's also important to remove uneaten food promptly, so it doesn't foul the water. Bettas are sensitive to water conditions and they often fall prey to fin rot if conditions deteriorate.</p><h2>Can You Keep Several Bettas Together? </h2><p>Male bettas can never be kept together because they'll fight with each other, often to the death. Males will also attack females to a lesser degree and should only be kept with a female for a brief time for breeding purposes. Multiple female bettas can be kept together as long as there is plenty of room for each to establish her own space.</p><h2>Male and Female Bettas </h2><p>Males are more vividly colored than females. They have much longer fins and they're more aggressive. Females are shorter and have wider bodies. They'll display an ""egg spot"" between the ventral and anal fins when they are mature. Females lack the distinctive ""beard"" that males display when flaring.</p><h2>What Is a Bubble Nest? </h2><p>A bubble nest is a floating bundle of bubbles blown by male bettas. The bubbles are created from saliva, making them more durable and also slightly sticky so they adhere to each other at the surface of the water. The purpose of the nest is to incubate eggs and young fry after spawning. Males will often blow bubble nests even when no female is present. Generally, the blowing of a bubble nest by a lone male is a sign that it is healthy and comfortable in his environment.</p><p>When bettas breed, the male entices the female under his bubble next, wraps his body around hers, and fertilizes the eggs as she lays them. The eggs will start to sink and the male gathers them in his mouth and blows them into his bubble nest. After they are finished spawning, the male chases the female away and will attack her if she is not removed from the breeding tank. The male will care for the eggs in the bubble next and also cares for they fry when they hatch. Once they are old enough to swim around on their own, the male should be removed. Feed the babies powdered fry food, infusoria, and newly hatched brine shrimp. Separate the males once they become aggressive to each other.</p><p>Bettas Need More Than Bowls.</p>",883

They are so ornate when they are young, and they do well in tank life. Be aware that chevron tangs will lose their juvenile colors as they grow into adults and become much larger. As an adult, it is still a nice looking fish, as well as a good algae eater.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Regal Angelfish, Royal Angelfish, Empress Angelfish, Blue-Banded Angelfish</p><p>Adult Size: 10 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 years</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The distribution of this fish extends from Hawaii southeastward to eastern Polynesia, southward to central Polynesia, westward to the Marianas Islands, and doubtless to many other adjoining areas. The adults inhabit the shallower oxygen enriched waters close to the surge zone of the reef where rocks and crevices are found, often collecting in schools. The juveniles prefer the deeper, finger coral inhabited waters and live singly. </p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>The juvenile stage of the chevron tang is very colorful with deep purple, orange, and red marking. In captivity, the chevron tang seems to retain its juvenile colors for quite a while longer than it seems to in the wild. There are several cases where the chevron retained its juvenile colors for more than three years, whereas in the wild, the chevron seems to shift to its adult colors after a year.</p><p>Once in the adult stage, the red and purple colors fade and the coloring becomes dark brown, almost black, with the sides of the body and head marked by many fine, horizontal, yellowish-gray lines. Because the adult stage of the chevron tang is similar in appearance to that of a  kole (yellow-eye surgeonfish) tang, it is sometimes referred to as the Hawaiian black kole. The differences are that it does not have the yellow ring around the eye, the body is darker in color, and its pectoral fins turn a dark brown color, where the kole's pectoral fins are almost transparent.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>This is not an overly aggressive fish, so it may get picked on by more aggressive surgeonfish. It will usually get along well with other tank inhabitants, with the exception of its own kind, and it rarely bothers immobile invertebrates. Its diet makes it a great complementary companion for other peaceful surgeonfish such as the yellow tang or the Pacific sailfin tang, though you need to keep an eye on compatibility.</p><p>In the wild, a cleaner wrasse would normally keep a tang parasite free. Alternatively, you can add neon gobies or cleaner shrimp to your home tank to help them remove parasites that might crop up.</p><h2>Chevron Tang Habitat and Care </h2><p>The minimum aquarium size suggested for this fish is at least 135 gallons. It is a big swimmer and needs a lot of space.</p><p>Being among the smallest and least active of the surgeonfish, you would think a smaller aquarium would suit it, but it needs a lot of space for algae to grow and for them to harvest on their own. They need plenty of naturally grown algae and accumulated detritus. To meet their dietary needs they will need a large aquarium with lots of live rock. They will benefit even more with the inclusion of live sand.</p><p>They use their teeth to lift and sift through various types of rocks, sand, and other surfaces and use their mouths to vacuum up the algae. In the aquarium, you will often see little lip marks on the glass where algae used to be.</p><p>They are susceptible to bacteria resulting from organic buildup which deteriorates water quality. They will need vigorous filtration, protein skimming, and regular small water changes.</p><h2>Chevron Tang Diet </h2><p>Although this fish is a herbivore in the wild, with its main diet consisting of marine microalgae growth, you can also feed it shrimp and other meaty foods in captivity. The majority of their intake will be vegetable matter. The chevron tang is excellent for keeping the brown (diatom) algae and green hair algae in check in your aquarium. </p><p>This fish is sometimes called a bristletooth tang due to its nature of feeding. They use bristle-like teeth to eat detritus which contains minute algae rather than the filamentous algae eaten by other tangs. The Ctenochaetus species, referred to as both the bristletooth or combtooth tangs, have several rows of small flexible comb-like teeth (up to 30 teeth) along with a protrusive pouting mouth. </p><p>Provide lots of marine algae, prepared frozen formulas containing algae or spirulina, frozen brine and mysid shrimp, and flake foods. Use a vegetable clip to adhere Japanese nori seaweed to the aquarium glass. Feed three times a day in smaller amounts instead of a large quantity once a day. As continuous grazers, they will benefit from this. This will also keep the water quality better over a longer period of time.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>This species does not seem to have any unique identifying characteristics between the sexes. Males will assume brighter courtship colors during mating periods.</p><h2>Breeding the Chevron Tang  </h2><p>The chevron tang, like other surgeonfish, is pelagic, meaning it's a free-spawner or egg-scatterer that spawns in groups. The female ejects her small eggs in the water column after which the male swims over and through the egg cloud fertilizing as he goes. The female produces hundreds of eggs at a time a number of times per year, usually in the spring and summer months.</p><p>The clear, fertilized eggs float to the surface and join the stream of plankton where the larva feed and develop into miniature adults. </p>",894

It is also one of the easier egg laying fish to breed in an aquarium.</p><p>Gourami care and breeding (spawning) requirements vary slightly from species to species, but most Gouramis have the same basic needs. If you are considering spawning your Gourami, learn the basic requirements, and then check the profile for your species to see if they have specific needs.</p><h2>Aquarium Setup and Tankmates </h2><p>Gouramis are relatively undemanding, and therefore are well suited for most community aquariums. Choose non-aggressive tankmates of similar size. Dwarf Cichlids are suitable, as are characins and other labyrinth fish. Because the males may be territorial, keep only one male Gourami in a tank. If space is large enough to allow each to claim its own territory, two may be tried.</p><p>Fine to medium size substrate of neutral color is preferable. Optimum water temperature for most gourami species is 74 79 degrees Fahrenheit (24 26 degrees Celsius). The water pH should be neutral to slightly acidic, with low hardness. Plant the aquarium well with Cryptocoryne, Java Fern, Vallisneria or other sturdy aquatic vegetation.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>Gouramis will eat almost any food; however, it's important to vary the diet to ensure balanced nutrition. A combination of dry flake food as well as frozen and fresh/live foods will provide a well-rounded diet. When conditioning fish prior to breeding, offer fresh vegetables such as lettuce, cooked peas, and spinach, as well as live foods such as blackworms, brine shrimp, and glass worms. All breeding specimens must be well-fed and healthy before moving them to a breeding tank. </p><h2>Breeding Tank </h2><p>The water level in the breeding tank should be six inches deep for breeding most gouramis. For larger species of gouramis, it may need to be slightly deeper. Lighting should be subdued, and the water temperature should be slowly increased for several days prior to spawning until it reaches 82-85 degrees. The water movement should be minimal so the bubble nest is not disturbed. A sponge filter is good to use for breeding tanks, as it won't suck up the baby fish.</p><p>All gourami fish are egg layers that build bubble nests for spawning and raising their young. Place some floating plants or other floating objects in the tank as most species of Gourami build bubble nests that are attached to these floating objects. Some experts use pieces of styrofoam as the floating platforms in the breeding tank.</p><p>Carefully monitor all conditions of your tank, such as water temperature and pH, both before and after breeding. Also, make sure the tank has a lid. While the adult fish do not require this, the young fry are very sensitive to any temperature shifts. </p><h2>Selecting a Male and Female </h2><p>If you don't already know the gender of your gouramis, examine them closely. Females usually have more rounded dorsal and anal fins while the male's fins are more pointed at the rear edge. Females will often swell in width when they are carrying eggs. In some species, there may be distinct color differences between males and females. In any case, it is important to choose a healthy pair with a female that is clearly carrying eggs.</p><h2>Transferring a Breeding Pair </h2><p>Move your selected female to the breeding tank first, providing the fish a chance to acclimate and locate various hiding spots. After a day or so, you can move the male to the tank. Watch to make sure the female has places to hide, as this will be needed during the egg-laying process. If the male harasses the female to the point of causing scrapes or preventing the female's hiding and seclusion, try adding a second female to the tank to distract the male.</p><h2>Breeding Process </h2><p>It may take several days for the fish to breed. In the meantime, if your species is one that builds a bubble nest, the male may be constructing it among the floating plants or objects. The male may even use a corner of the tank as an anchor for the bubble nest. When the nest is built and the female is ready to spawn, the male will wrap his body around hers under the nest and fertilize the eggs as she lays them.</p><p>After the female lays eggs, which number in the hundreds or even thousands, the male will catch them in his mouth as they fall and the bring each egg individually to the bubble nest. If the species is not a bubble nest builder, the eggs will remain randomly distributed around the tank. </p><p>The female should be removed very soon after laying as she may begin eating the eggs. The male should be left in the breeding tank, as it is the male's duty to care for the nest and fry until they can swim freely. Once the fry are free-swimming, the male also can be removed. For species that do not form bubble nests, remove both parents immediately after spawning to prevent egg predation. </p><h2>Caring for Fry </h2><p>Initially, the fry will absorb their egg yolk sac for nutrition, but as soon as they are free swimming, you will need to begin providing nutrients. Begin by feeding specialized foods that are small enough for the tiny fry to consume. Options include liquid fish food, rotifers, or infusoria, all of which are available at aquarium stores. Feed the fry often, six times a day or more. Once the fish are larger, at about four to seven days, begin feeding baby brine shrimp. It will take several weeks for them to grow large enough to move to a normal aquarium.</p><p>Make sure to keep the water clean. Just as you would in a normal aquarium, make partial water changes, but be careful not to scoop out the tiny fry by mistake. You will almost certainly end up with more surviving fish than you can keep yourself, so seek out people to buy or adopt. After a few weeks, when they appear able to eat standard fish food, you can move the young gourami to their larger home.</p><h2>Popular Gourami Species </h2><p>There are roughly a dozen species of gourami that are commonly seen in the aquarium trade. Several of them have more than one color morph, but are still the same species.</p>",1030

Although some species may be illegally imported and should never enter your tank, most of the concerns about pet catfish come down to size. All fish start small, but some catfish species can outgrow most home aquariums and are much better suited for a large public aquarium. Be sure to do your research on which species you want to keep to ensure your catfish will have a long and happy life.</p><h2>Is it Ethical to Keep Catfish as Pets? </h2><p>Short answer: Yes. Long answer: It depends on which species and the size of your aquarium. The main concern about pet catfish is their growth potential. All fish start out small, but many of them do not stay that size for long. No matter what they tell you at the pet store, it is critical that you do your own research and choose your desired species carefully. Find out how big it gets as an adult and how big of an aquarium it will need.</p><p>Most of the time, selecting a catfish species for your aquarium comes down to how much room is available in your tank. Making sure you are selecting the correct species for your space may take more research than usual. If you are not sure if the fish you are looking at is the correct species, don't buy it.</p><h2>What Do Catfish Require for Their Environment? </h2><p>Catfish are primarily bottom-dwelling fish. Although many will spend time swimming in the mid-water column, catfishes use their barbels to search out for food buried in the substrate. Their barbels are actually full of taste buds, constantly on the lookout for tasty morsels. Keeping this in mind, your catfish will require bottom access. Most aquarium setups are well suited to catfish except heavily planted tanks. Catfish can easily get lost and tangled in lots of low-lying plant life.</p><p>Substrate type for catfish should be on the lighter size. Standard aquarium gravel to medium sand is a good choice for most catfish. Larger rocks can be problematic for smaller catfish, and larger catfish have been known to swallow rocks. Some species, such as plecos, like to have softer wood to nibble on. When adding wood to a tank, be sure it is safe for aquariums. Some species of wood can leach dangerous chemicals into your aquarium water.</p><p>Despite common lore, catfish are omnivores, with some leaning more towards the herbivorous side, and others the carnivorous side. Remember, there are about 3000 species within the catfish family. Do not expect most catfish to clean up your algae. You will need to control your algae through limiting its nutrient source in most freshwater systems.</p><h2>How to Take Care of Catfish </h2><p>Catfish, like all other fish species, require good water quality and an appropriate diet for best health. Remember, not all catfish like to snack on algae, so be sure to feed them regularly. Most tropical fish diets will be just fine for catfish living in mixed species tanks. If you have a catfish only tank, you can better select a diet in the herbivore or carnivore spectrum. Catfish will often forage throughout the day, so expect them to get pieces of everything you feed to your tank. Even with catfish doing clean up, you will need to continue with your regular maintenance routine. Some catfish species are nocturnal feeders, however, so you may need to put food in the aquarium for them at night when the lights are going out.</p><p>When choosing a catfish for your tank, choose your species carefully. Here is a helpful guide to the most appropriate catfish species for home aquariums. When it comes to catfish, adult size is critical to keeping your fish happy throughout its life. When all fish start out the same size, it can be difficult to envision how big they could be and not all pet stores will provide you with this information. Even choosing a docile plecostomus can be challenging, with some species topping out at 8 inches, while others can grow a few feet long. And, some catfish, such as Corydoras species, are docile bottom scavengers that can be mixed with other small fish, others like the Redtail Catfish are predators that will eat any other fish that can fit into its mouth! It is critical that you do your research in advance to make sure the catfish you are bringing home will fit into your aquarium based on its size and other species you already have. If you cannot guarantee the species you are looking at is correct, don't buy it.</p>",773
93,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-koi-fish-survive-the-winter-5217543,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Can Koi Fish Survive the Winter?</h1>,"<h1>Can Koi Fish Survive the Winter?</h1><p>Koi fish are amazingly hardy animals and can tolerate a wide range of temperatures. In their native waters, koi are able to withstand very warm almost-freezing temperatures. When kept in backyard ponds, there are a few points you will need to consider to keep your koi happy and healthy when colder weather comes.</p><h2>How to Keep Koi Fish Safe in Winter </h2><p>If your fish reside in an area that can reach freezing temperatures, be sure to address the following checklist to ensure your fish will survive the winter.</p><h3>Insulation </h3><p>The biggest consideration when over-wintering koi outside is to make sure their water will not freeze into one solid block of ice. Surface freezing is fine for most ponds. How many inches down your pond freezes will depend on your weather, so ensure your fish have enough room to safely tuck themselves under the ice. If your pond is overstocked, there is a risk that the fish will be packed in too tightly and run out of oxygen or produce too much ammonia, causing stress that could cause secondary disease.</p><p>Most koi ponds built into the ground are well-insulated by the soil; this allows for mostly a surface freeze. Above-ground ponds or temporary holding ponds are at risk of deep freezing. In order to allow for room for your fish, wrap insulation, dirt or blankets around your exposed walls. This will prevent your pond freezing at deeper levels.</p><h3>Oxygen Access </h3><p>Even in frozen ponds, your fish will need oxygen to survive. A solid-ice surface cuts fish off from life saving oxygen and can easily wipe out an entire pond. You must provide some access to the air at the water's surface in order to keep your fish alive. You can do this by installing a pond deicer, aerator or running water feature.</p><p>Pond deicers work by thawing a small area of your pond surface in order to allow for air to penetrate into the water. These need to be checked frequently in order to ensure proper function. They do not heat the pond, only a small area of the water at the pond surface,</p><p>Aerators work by keeping ice from completely covering the area directly above them. In very cold temperatures, however, the surface may still freeze over. Also, you do not want to bring the warmer water from the bottom of the pond to the surface using a bubbler on the bottom. These air stones should be placed just below the surface in the winter.</p><p>Running water features work similarly to an aerator by constantly disrupting the formation of a solid ice surface. These work slightly better than an aerator, but can cause supercooling if they are too large and can also freeze in very cold temperatures.<br/></p><h3>Supercooling Features</h3><p>Air exposed to super cold temperatures, such as that within a tall waterfall, can supercool ponds by quickly dropping the water temperature, commonly as the sun goes down. A sudden decrease in temperature can negatively impact your koi and potentially kill them. If you have a tall water feature, it is recommended to bypass it during very cold weather conditions.</p><h3>Feeding </h3><p>In colder water temperatures, your koi fish's metabolism will reach extremely low levels. If the temperature is going to drop below 45 degrees Fahrenheit/7 Celsius, it is not recommended to feed your fish. Your fish may beg for food when the water is warm, but it is best to keep their gastrointestinal tracts free of food that may stop moving through if the water is expected to get colder. Usually, koi are pretty good about not wanting food when temperatures drop, but if you still get hungry faces, tell them it's for their own good.</p><h2>Can I Keep My Koi Fish Inside (link to other article) </h2><p>Provided you have addressed the points above, your fish will be just fine outside all winter long. If you cannot provide the correct outdoor environment for your fish over the winter, you will need to bring them to a temporary indoor tub, commonly referred to as ""over-wintering.""</p><p>There are two critical components to successfully over-wintering your koi indoors.</p><h3>Requirement 1: Enough Space </h3><p>Yes, usually most indoor setups are severely space restricted. For most ponds, it is recommended to have at least 250 gallons per koi, which is considerably more than most koi owners think they'll need. Indoor holding tubs may be considerably smaller, since they are only temporary. For koi, the bigger the tub you can set up, the better. More water will decrease the amount of stress your koi are under and reduce the risk of secondary infections.</p><h3>Requirement 2: Bring Your Filtration with You </h3><p>The worst thing that can happen to a new indoor setup is New Pond Syndrome. This occurs with all new systems that do not have established biological filtration. All those ""instant start"" products on the pet store shelves are not effective. Very large fish in a smaller pond are at very high risk for deadly ammonia spikes.</p><p>The best thing you can do to ensure your fish will survive this transition is to bring their filter media along. This is usually either matting, strapping or plastic beads. By bringing these along to your indoor setup, and placing them into a filter for the indoor holding tank, the ammonia level in the water will not spike and your fish will be much happier.</p><h2>How to Keep My Koi Fish Healthy During Cold Snaps </h2><p>Temporary periods of cold water are possible for any pond. Even if it is rare in your area to get freezing temperatures, all koi pond owners should plan ahead. Be sure to address the key points above and be sure your pond does not freeze into a solid block by providing adequate insulation and that your fish have access to surface oxygen. Bypass all tall water features and hold off feeding. These are the best steps to take to ensure your fish will be okay.</p><p>Once the water warms up again, your fish may be a bit sluggish to get back to normal behavior and appetite. This is normal, and how long it takes to get back to their regular behavior depends entirely on your individual pond's filtration and water temperature. Sometimes, one or two fish will not get back to normal as fast as the others in the pond. Once you notice a is fish struggling, it is best to call your aquatic veterinarian immediately to ensure nothing gets worse.</p>",1064
97,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-you-keep-koi-fish-inside-5217249,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Can I Keep My Koi Fish Inside?</h1>,"<h1>Can I Keep My Koi Fish Inside?</h1><p>All fish may start out small, but some don't stay that way. Most koi fish have the potential to grow over a foot long, many over 2 feet and some over 3 feet in length. Unless you have the giant granddaddy of all tanks or need to temporarily house your koi inside for the winter, keep koi out of that tiny fish tank. An outdoor pond is best suited for housing koi long-term.</p><h2>Minimum Requirements for Indoor Koi System </h2><p>If you have no choice but to keep your koi inside, you will need to outfit your system to handle their size and waste output. If you're thinking, 'Well, I just won't feed them much, so they won't grow,' would you do the same with your other pets? If you don't have the space to keep koi, it's a good sign that you shouldn't get a koi. There are many other fish species that take up significantly less room that would be a much better choice in a limited space situation. Goldfish can often be found in colors and patterns that resemble koi, but they are only 10-12 inches when they are full grown in most cases. Because of this, they are better suited than koi for indoor aquariums.</p><h3>500-Gallon Tank </h3><p>A 500-gallon tank is a bare minimum for even two or three koi. In a typical koi pond, you should expect to keep one koi per 250 gallons of water. Large, reproductively active female koi will need 500 gallons each to maintain their egg mass. These more conservative calculations serve pond owners very well by providing better water quality and easier maintenance. Overstocked ponds can have severe issues with poor water chemistry and can cause stress in fish without any room to spread out.</p><p>No matter the pond or aquarium size, you will need to have at least three koi. Koi are communal fish and do not do well on their own. Some do OK in groups of two, but a three-koi school is the recommended minimum.</p><p>If you are planning on a large indoor aquarium, be sure it has enough room for your koi to turn around easily. A large thin aquarium, such as one built into a wall, will not suit koi, no matter how many gallons it holds. Repeatedly banging into the tank walls or having a narrow space to turn around will result in crooked backs and damaged fins.</p><h3>Adequate Filtration </h3><p>Koi, like other carp species, make a lot of waste. Eating heavily and constantly is part of how they're able to grow so large and maintain a massive body size. When there's lots of waste coming out, your filtration better be able to keep up. Again, please don't starve your koi for convenience. Before you decide to keep koi, make sure you can keep up with the maintenance.</p><p>If you are starting a new aquarium, beware of New Tank or New Pond Syndrome. In this syndrome, the biological filtration has not yet been established, therefore harmful spikes in ammonia and nitrite will occur in the water before fully cycling to safer nitrate. It may take 4-6 weeks for this process to occur and elevated ammonia and nitrite can be very dangerous to fish. If you are overwintering your koi indoors, be sure to bring some of their filter media along to add to the new filter in order to prevent this. The beneficial bacteria in the old filter media will grow in the new filter faster than if you are starting from scratch with no bacteria in the biofilter.</p><h3>Net on Top </h3><p>With limited space and a foreign, indoor environment, koi are more prone to jumping out of their pond. Although the need for predator deterrent indoors is minimal, unless you have a inquisitive cat, you should net the top of your indoor pond at least for the first few months. Once your fish have settled into their new environment, you can slowly move the net off in sections. Monitor your fish to ensure they are not attempting to jump out of the smaller indoor enclosure.</p><h3>Temperature Requirements </h3><p>Koi are temperate fish, so they do not require a theater. If you are bringing your koi indoors for the winter in order to keep them from freezing solid outside, you should keep your water temperature at least 39 degrees Fahrenheit /4 degrees Celsius. At temperatures from 39-45 degrees Fahrenheit /4-7 degrees Celsius, your koi will not swim much or be hungry and that is to be expected. As the spring temperatures warm their main pond, try to wait to move them back outside until the water temperature in the pond matches their indoor water temperature.</p><p>For permanently indoor aquariums, you should not need to worry too much about temperature. Room temperature water around the high 60s to low 70s degrees Fahrenheit / 18-24 degrees Celsius is great for koi. Expect them to be fairly active and plan on feeding at least once a day. You will not see much fluctuation in temperature throughout the seasons indoors, so you can expect little to no spawning activity, which can be beneficial to many female koi who would rather avoid the violence of spawning males. Spawning is triggered by cooler water temperatures warming to 64 degrees Fahrenheit / 18 degrees Celsius or above in the springtime. Koi may not spawn if the water temperature is above this year around. However, female koi that do not release their eggs over many years can become ""egg bound,"" especially if overfed so that they don't resorb the eggs at the end of spawning season.</p><p>Overall, it is not recommended to keep koi indoors. If you are overwintering them, this is a temporary setup and a better alternative than being frozen into a solid block of ice. If you want a permanent indoor setup, space is critical. The bigger the better for koi and remember they need large water filters.</p><p>Be sure your indoor pond or aquarium has room for a fully grown adult koi to turn easily and not run into each other or the walls. You will also need to maintain a robust filtration system. Keeping koi indoors may not be easy, so if you would rather not deal with all that, how about some nice tiny tropical fish instead?</p>",1043

The parasite attacks the gills, making it impossible to breathe. It is deadly to fish and can kill them in a matter of hours to days. While Brooklynella can affect any species of fish, it is most closely and commonly associated with the subfamily Amphiprioninae (clownfish), members of the Damselfish family, and therefore is typically referred to as clownfish disease. Treatment must be provided as quickly as possible to be effective. If your fish display any symptoms like gasping for air at the waterline, mucous on their bodies, skin lesions, or scraping themselves against objects in the tank, help should be sought immediately from an aquatic veterinarian.</p><h2>What Is Brooklynella? </h2><p>Brooklynella is a fatal disease that affects marine fish by attacking their gills and creating a buildup of mucous, and it is caused by the ciliated protozoan These parasites live on the skin of fish and can lead to severe respiratory problems once the gills are infested. Under a microscope, they look like kidney bean-shaped parasites covered in cilia. Although this parasitic scourge is similar to other aquatic parasites, it requires a fish host to survive and is not particular in its quest to find a proper host. Brooklynella has been known to affect clownfish and members of their scientific family, but any species of fish can contract this parasite.</p><h2>Symptoms of Brooklynella in Fish </h2><p>Most similar symptomatically to Oodinium, Brooklynella is also a parasite that primarily attacks the gills first.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>At the onset, fish may scrape up against objects, rapid respiration develops, and fish often gasp for air at the surface as the gills become clogged with mucous. Very quickly, the fish will become lethargic, refuse to eat, and its colors will fade. The most noticeable difference that sets Brooklynella apart from Oodinium is the heavy amount of slime that is produced by a fish that has contracted this parasite. As the disease progresses, a thick, typically white-colored mucous covers the body. This will usually start at the head and spread outward across the entire body. Skin lesions can also appear, and it is not uncommon for signs of secondary bacterial infections to arise, such as redness and fin rot. </p><h2>Causes of Brooklynella </h2><p>Brooklynella is always caused by , but fish can contract this parasite from a variety of sources.</p><p>Along with clownfish, additional species like angelfish, tangs or surgeonfish, wrasses, jawfishes, seahorses, and many others can host Brooklynella parasites. The protozoa that cause this disease to reproduce asexually using simple binary fission through conjugation, which is why they can multiply much more rapidly than (Marine Ich/White Spot Disease) and (Velvet/Coral Fish Disease). This rapid reproduction explains why Brooklynella can kill fish within a few days. Sometimes, it can kill mere hours after symptoms are first presented. For this reason, accurate diagnosis and immediate treatment of all fish exposed to these life-threatening organisms are critical.</p><h2>Diagnosing Brooklynella in Fish </h2><p>Brooklynella can have symptoms that appear similar to other health conditions, like bacterial infections that also cause white, cloudy-looking skin on fish. For this reason, any additional symptoms should be observed. Your aquatic veterinarian will likely determine whether your fish are experiencing breathing issues. Biopsies taken from the skin can also be examined under a microscope to confirm whether Brooklynella is the cause of the symptoms.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>There are varying suggestions on how to treat an aquarium that has been infested with Brooklynella. They range from adding copper, malachite green, and other remedies, with some of those recommended being used in conjunction with formaldehyde. The consensus is that the best and most effective treatment for Brooklynella is formaldehyde alone.</p><p>Formalin is a 37 percent solution of formaldehyde gas dissolved in water with methanol added as a stabilizer. It has been found to be an effective treatment for Brooklynella as well as other parasitic diseases. However, formalin is a very powerful chemical and should be used very carefully. Make sure you fully know how to treat ich diseased fish with formalin so that you follow the proper instructions and take the correct safety measures. Typically, a standard formalin solution is mixed with either fresh or saltwater in a separate treatment container. Initially, all fish are given a quick dip in the formalin at a higher concentration, followed by continued treatment in a prolonged bath of formalin at a lower concentration in a quarantine tank (QT). The longer the fish are exposed to the formalin treatment, the more effective it will be at eliminating this disease.</p><p>If a formalin solution is not available for immediate use, temporary relief may be provided by giving fish a freshwater dip or bath. Even though this treatment will not cure the disease, it can help to remove some of the parasites, as well as reduce the amount of mucous in the gills to assist with respiration problems. Once the initial dip or bath is done, place the fish into a QT under a hyposalinity treatment to help keep any possible new free-swimming protists from infecting the fish again, and then obtain a formalin medication as soon as possible to begin treatment.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Brooklynella </h2><p>Brooklynella is highly contagious, and fish living in the same aquarium as any individual affected by this parasite should be removed and screened by an aquatic veterinarian. Since this disease can develop so rapidly, many fish infested by these parasites do not survive. However, if the symptoms are caught early enough and treatment begins immediately, a formalin solution can be very effective at removing the parasites and preventing fatalities. These treatments must be repeated every two to three days for at least three weeks in a quarantine tank, but some fish may have more severe infestations that can be fatal.</p><h2>How to Prevent Brooklynella </h2><h3>Purchasing Well-Maintained Fish </h3><p>One way to prevent Brooklynella from infesting your aquarium is to only buy well-maintained, captive-bred aquarium fish. Brooklynella was originally known as clownfish disease because it was most commonly seen in that species. Wild-caught clownfish often suffer from this disease, but it's rarely seen on captive-bred clownfish. When purchasing any species to introduce fish to your aquarium, always try to work with sellers that maintain the ideal health screenings and living conditions for their fish.</p><h3>Quarantine New Fish </h3><p>Any new aquarium fish should be quarantined in a separate tank for two to four weeks prior to being placed in your aquarium. If any symptoms begin to present, avoid placing these fish in a tank with any others. A freshwater dip is also beneficial along with quarantining new fish. This will help ensure that only healthy fish are introduced to an aquarium, as many parasites can be at least partially removed during dips that last up to five minutes.</p>",1137
8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/breeding-jewel-fish-4077746,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Breeding the Jewel Fish (Ruby Cichlid)</h1>,"<h1>Breeding the Jewel Fish (Ruby Cichlid)</h1><h2>Jewel Fish are easy to breed but tough to keep in a community tank</h2><p>There are several different species of Jewel fish; all are very beautiful but aggressive members of the cichlid family. Jewel fish will attack its own species as well as any other fish, no matter the size, when in breeding season and while rearing their fry. Therefore, for purposes of breeding, the Jewel fish should be kept in a separate aquarium, set up and maintained for just the needs of this species. As a first or second breeding experience, this fish is worth the trouble: it is easy to breed, and the mated pair do all the work of fry rearing.</p><h2>About the Jewel Fish </h2><p>When not in breeding season, the Jewel fish is a dull olive color overall, with three black dots on its sides. However, when it wears courting colors the Jewel fish is absolutely beautiful. In breeding season, the head and belly turn a fiery red and the scales on the flanks and gill-plates sparkle like blue-green jewels. All the fins are edged with brilliant red and shine profusely with blue-green spots. The black dot in the center of the body disappears entirely when a pair of Jewel fish are ready to lay eggs.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>To tell the difference between the sexes, look for a plump female: when in breeding condition the female will be full of roe (eggs). The male is even more jeweled than the female, particularly in the regions of the gill-plates, the flanks, and the tail fin. His is not necessarily the brightest red however; indeed, at times the female is so brilliant that the uninitiated might consider her to be the male.</p><h2>Basic Behavior of the Jewel Fish in Breeding Season </h2><p>The Jewel fish, is an open water spawner, which means it looks for a place to dig holes for spawning activities. Once a male and female have bonded, they form a definite partnership and will kill others of their species if given the chance during the breeding and fry raising process. </p><p>As with other medium-sized cichlids, Jewel fish go through a mating ritual which looks like fighting; then the pair will be close to each other for several days, finally laying eggs and fertilizing them side by side, egg by egg.</p><p>Unlike other cichlid species from Africa, the duties of egg care and fry raising are split evenly between the two very attentive parents. The young fish are cared for even when they are well able to go out on their own. Sometimes the family will stay together until the fry are almost ready to reach sexual maturity.</p><p>A cichlid lover will get great pleasure out of the Jewel fish, especially when a well-matched pair devotes themselves unreservedly to caring for their brood. For months, they may be observed guiding their offspring around the tank, showing off their splendid coloring during the entire process. </p><h2>Feeding a Jewel Fish During Breeding </h2><p>Feeding a Breeding Pair: Care of this species is not difficult. They are not choosy about food but must be provided ample live and frozen protein-rich foods before and during the spawning and fry raising period.</p><p>Feeding the Fry: The Jewel fish fry are able to devour baby brine shrimp and finely ground fry food immediately after hatching. The parents will make sure they are safe and well-fed by leading the brood to wherever the food is provided. They are large fry, and the parent fish will herd the family around the tank in search of infusoria, microalgae and edible tidbits around the bottom of the aquarium. It is for this reason that, for best results, the breeding aquarium should not be a bare tank with ""new"" water; it should be well established with thriving live plants to ensure ample food supply for the fry in their first three weeks of life.</p><p>After three weeks, the fry will greedily accept anything they are offered, but for fastest growth continue feeding at least some fresh or frozen baby brine shrimp for the protein. A full belly is a healthy belly with any growing cichlid, so feeding should be often.</p><h2>Environmental Requirements for Breeding </h2><p>The Jewel fish is not particularly choosy about pH or hardness within reason since they are flood-plain dwellers in nature. However, these fish must be provided an efficient filter system, to ensure clear and clean water at all times. It is also important to maintain a steady temperature from 78 to 81 degrees Fahrenheit for breeding to take place.</p><h2>Hatching Jewel Fry </h2><p>Mature Jewel fish produce 250 300 yellowish eggs that are about 2 mm in diameter.<br/></p><p>Hatching Time: The eggs hatch in three days; no intervention is required or suggested. The parents will constantly fan the eggs with their fins and pick at them to remove fungus and dead eggs. The parents will not eat the eggs if they are not disturbed during breeding.</p><p>Fry Wiggling: Once born, the fry will be hidden by the parents for several days, probably still within the safety of the flowerpot. They are helpless during this time but protected by the parents with their very lives.</p><p>Free-Swimming: Within seven days, you should see the proud parents showing off their newly swimming fry cloud, making short ventures, herding them to find micro food around the bottom of the aquarium.</p><h2>Feeding Jewel Fish Fry </h2><p>Food for Days 8 21: Jewel fish fry will eat baby brine shrimp, micro worms, and finely ground fry food, all of which are very rich in protein.</p><p>Food Beyond 21 Days: The fry will constantly be hungry, foraging as a cloud of fry, under the parents' careful and watchful eyes, but at this point, they can eat high quality, high protein flake food, ground into a powder in your fingers. They will eat just about anything; as long as you keep the flow of baby brine shrimp and daphnia coming, they will grow very quickly.</p><h3>Warning</h3><h2>Should You Breed Jewel Fish? </h2><p>It is strange that such an aggressive species as the Jewel fish is one of the most docile and devoted of all freshwater fish parents. If it were not for their hostile disposition, this brightly colored fish would certainly be one of the most popular of the cichlid group and a staple in almost every community aquarium, right alongside the Angel fish.</p><p>Once you have a mated pair, getting them to breed will never be a problem, the problem is what to do with the fry. The Jewel fish is the one cichlid that everyone admires for its beauty, but no one wants in a community aquarium. The parents will not eat their fry like so many other cichlids and will go on making more and more. Give this some thought before you begin, but the rewards of breeding this fish are unending.</p><p>Especially, in a classroom situation, the Jewel fish is ideal; the husbandry displayed will fill many class discussions about life in general.</p>",1113

Possibly produced by crossing the midas cichlid (and the Gold Severum cichlid (, the blood parrot cichlid's genetic mixture has left the fish with a combination of physical traits that compromise the fish's ability to thrive. It has a very small mouth, for example, which makes it difficult for the fish to feed itself adequately. Some aquarium enthusiasts believe this is a hybrid that should not be bred, and some even go so far as to boycott pet shops that sell it.</p><p>However, the unusual appearance round body and beak-like head with large eyes along with the fish's ability to coexist with other species in a community environment, has made it popular among some enthusiasts.</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>The blood parrot cichlid is a hybrid produced by breeding the midas and the redhead cichlid. The fish was first created in Taiwan around 1986. Although they've been on the market for some time, blood parrot cichlids were not seen widely in pet shops before the year 2000. Usually sold under the name blood parrot or bloody parrots, they should not be confused with freshwater parrot cichlids or the saltwater parrot fish .</p><p>Controversy surrounds this fish, especially the ethics of creating it through cross-breeding. Of most concern are the numerous anatomical anomalies, some bordering on deformities, that create hardships for the fish. For example, the mouth is quite small and oddly shaped, and this could affect the fish's ability to eat. At feeding time, blood parrot cichlids may have difficulty competing with tankmates that are more aggressive and have larger mouths. Blood parrot cichlids also have spinal and swim bladder deformities that affect their swimming abilities. Creating a fish with such deformities is considered by many to be unethical and even cruel, and some enthusiasts go so far as to boycott shops that sell this hybrid.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Blood parrots are usually bright orange, although red, yellow, or gray fish are also possible. Unethical breeders may also dye the fish to produce other colors. Adult fish grow to a length of about 7 to 8 inches (20 cm) and may reach an age of 10 to 15 years. Males are slightly larger than females.</p><p>These hybrids are easily recognized by their unique features a round body and a beak-like head with large eyes. The mouth typically remains open, and the teeth are deep down in the throat, which leaves the fish unable to fight and creates challenges for eating.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>Blood parrots should not be kept with aggressive fish, as they are not well equipped to compete for food or turf in the aquarium. Owners have kept them successfully in community tanks with a variety of peaceful fish. Mid-sized tetras, danios, angelfish, and catfish are all good possible tankmates.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>The habitat for the bloody parrot should be roomy and provide plenty of hiding places so they can set up their own territory. Rocks, driftwood, and clay pots on their sides are good options. Like other cichlids, these fish will dig in the gravel, so choose a substrate that is not too rough. The temperature should be maintained at about 80 degrees F. Lower temperatures will result in the loss of color and generally weaken their immune system, leaving the fish more susceptible to disease. The pH should be about 7, and the water soft.</p><p>Lighting should be subdued with a red-spectrum light. Change the water twice a month. These fish produce a lot of waste, so regular water changes and high-volume filtration is necessary.</p><p>Watch for high levels of nitrite and phosphate, which can contribute to blue-green algae that can kill your fish. Common diseases of blood parrots include ich parasites (treated by raising water temperature or by copper water treatments), swim bladder disease, and bacterial infections.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>Blood parrots will eat a variety of foods including flake, live, frozen, and freeze-dried foods. Sinking foods are easier for them to eat than floating foods. Most owners report bloodworms and live brine shrimp as a favorite treat. Foods high in b-carotene and canthaxanthin will help maintain their vibrant colors.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>Males and females are identical in coloring and pattern, but males are slightly larger than females.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>Although blood parrots have been known to mate and even lay eggs, generally they are infertile. There have been sporadic cases of successful spawnings, generally when females have been crossed with a non-hybrid fish. Like other cichlids, blood parrots will tend the eggs and resulting fry fastidiously. As with any eggs, those that are infertile will turn white and rapidly develop fungus. The parents will eat infertile eggs to prevent them from spreading the fungus to the fertile eggs.</p><p>Once the eggs hatch, daily water changes of 25 percent are critical to ensuring the health of the fry. Fresh baby brine shrimp are the optimum food during the first couple of weeks. Often pet shops will carry frozen baby brine shrimp, which you can also use. As the fry grow, they can be weaned to fine fry food.</p>",811

Some fish are more protective of territory; some are more inclined to fight over food. Do your research before adding a fish to your aquarium to make sure you're able to provide the environment needed to avoid injuries or death among your fish. Learn the signs of aggression and how to limit this behavior in seven fish that are notorious troublemakers.</p><h2>Signs of Fish Aggression </h2><p>Are your fish getting along? Watch for these signs of trouble in your tank that may need to be addressed to prevent stress, injury, or fatal attacks.</p><p>Active Attack: Among some species, including those in the wrasse family, conflicts commonly involve breeding territory and preferred hiding spots. You will see one fish actively biting or ramming into another fish. This dispute needs to be handled quickly by removing the aggressor or the victim, especially if they are already injured. You can attempt reintroduction after a few days, but the conflict may continue.<br/></p><p>Feeding Behavior: In a well designed tank of adequate size to house its fish population, all fish have equal access to food at feeding time. If you notice that certain fish are hiding during feeding time or that one fish consistently takes food away from other fish, you may need to reduce your population or just remove particularly problematic fish. Large fish aren't the only culprits; small fish that steal food from the operculum (gill covers) of larger fish may be causing stress, too.<br/></p><p>Charging: While less likely to cause acute injury than active attacking, charging creates insidious stress. It occurs when a seclusive fish attempts to leave its shelter, and a more aggressive fish forcefully swims toward it so that it retreats back into its hiding place. If this happens regularly, and the seclusive fish is unable to leave its home, it will become stressed and sick.<br/></p><p>Breeding: Some fish aggressively defend their nests, eggs, and young; others aggressively try to eat others' offspring. These situations are stressful and can result in injured or dead fish. If breeding is not your goal, it's easier to keep one fish of each species or non-breeding pairs.</p><h2>Limiting Fish Aggression </h2><p>Many fish from the family groups listed below have similar aggressive tendencies. It is strongly recommended that you research the environmental needs of any aggressive species you'd like to add to your aquarium prior to purchasing it.</p><h2>7 Aggressive Species </h2><p>The following fish are beautiful but potentially troublesome additions to an aquarium. Knowing their individual space requirements and behavioral tendencies can help you incorporate them into your aquatic environment, if possible, or avoid these aggressive fish altogether.</p><h2>Clown Triggerfish </h2><p>The clown triggerfish can grow very large over 18 inches and requires over 300 gallons per fish. They are vicious nibblers and will decimate hard coral and invertebrates. These aggressive fish require roommates that are as large and ""tough"" as they are.</p><h2>Neon Damselfish </h2><p>Many damselfish are known for fiercely defending their territory, and the neon damselfish is no exception. Although they do not need a lot of water volume per fish (about 30 gallons), they will aggressively attack any fish that approach their caves. They have even been known to bite their human caretakers.</p><h2>Blue Line Grouper </h2><p>Flickr/Lordhowensis </p><p>The blue line grouper is a small member of the monstrous grouper family, requiring a mere 250 gallons (minimum) per fish. These voracious fish eat smaller fish and crustaceans, so they should not be kept with any creatures small enough to fit into their mouths. Crustaceans that stay hidden in tight crevices may be safe if the grouper can not pry them out.</p><h2>Goldbar Wrasse </h2><p> Flickr/UM Rosenstiel School</p><p>The goldbar wrasse is a bright but aggressive addition to a saltwater tank. Requiring 125 gallons minimum, they become bullies when new fish are added to their tank. Once established in their territory, the wrasse will attack any new occupants. To minimize this behavior, wrasse should be the last addition to your tank, so all other fish can establish their territories first.</p><h2>Coral Hogfish </h2><p>Flickr/Russo's Reef </p><p>Coral hogfish transition from juveniles with pale pink and black with yellow spots to adults with striking maroon faces, black mid-body bands, and yellow bodies. They can grow up to eight inches and require 70 gallons per fish. They are beneficial to have in a tank since they will clean parasites off larger fish, but they will attack smaller fish and decimate coral.</p><h2>Banded Hawkfish </h2><p>Flickr/agasfer </p><p>Don't let its small size fool you the banded hawkfish is an aggressive tankmate. These attractive fish have a bright coloration and minimal tank requirements of 30 gallons. However, they require a tank with fish larger than themselves, as they will eat any smaller inhabitants including crustaceans.</p><h2>Jeweled Moray Eel </h2><p>As with all moray eels, jeweled morays  have two pairs of jaws and they bite. This species is smaller than many of its relatives, so it is better suited to smaller aquariums (at least 50 gallons in size). As nocturnal predators, eels will ambush fish and crustaceans in the night unless taught to feed during daylight hours. Eels are also escape artists, so make sure your tank has a secure lid.</p>",860
101,https://www.thesprucepets.com/anchor-worms-in-freshwater-fish-4776154,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>Anchor Worms in Freshwater Fish</h1>,"<h1>Anchor Worms in Freshwater Fish</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Anchor worms are macroscopic parasites, meaning they can be seen by the naked eye. They are commonly found on koi and goldfish, but can be found on many freshwater fish species. The ""worm"" part extending out of the fish's skin into the water is actually the female reproductive structure. Treating these parasites can be challenging depending on your aquarium setup and the parasite load.</p><h2>What Are Anchor Worms? </h2><p>Anchor worms (spp.) are not actually worms, but a crustacean copepod parasite that embeds into the fish's skin and has a worm-like tail that sticks out of the skin. The head of the parasite is under the fish's skin and has an anchor-like appendage that holds it in the skin. These parasites have multiple non-parasitic stages that live in the water. Once a male mates with a female, she attaches to a fish to mature into a reproductively-active adult. These parasites get the name ""worm"" from the extending female reproductive structure. Juvenile anchor worms will be free-swimming in your aquarium, but will not be a nuisance for your fish.</p><p>The genus of copepods infects most freshwater fish. They are commonly found on goldfish and koi. There are other similar genera of copepods that infect other freshwater and marine fish.</p><h2>Symptoms of Anchor Worms in Fish </h2><p>Anchor worms are one of the macroscopic freshwater fish parasites that are visible to the naked eye. Here are the obvious signs of anchor worms.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p><br/></p><h3>Visible Worms on Scales </h3><p>You will see the female reproductive structures that resemble short white worms sticking out from behind scales. The end of the white ""worm"" may have one or two egg sacs attached to it. These sacs contain their eggs and drop off into the aquarium to hatch.</p><h3>Oral Cavity Problems </h3><p>Anchor worms can also be found in the oral cavity of your fish. It will give the fish's mouth a ""baleen"" appearance, meaning that it looks like the long teeth of baleen whales.</p><h3>Skin Patches and Red Lesions </h3><p>Worms that have fallen off of your fish may leave behind skin patches of hemorrhage or fibrosis. Bacteria can infect the site of the anchor worm attachment, causing red lesions on the fish's skin.</p><h2>Causes of Anchor Worms </h2><p>Anchor worms are contagious among fish and occur when a new fish is added to an aquarium carrying juvenile anchor worms or a reproductively-active female in their skin. Skipping proper quarantine makes this parasite spread very rapidly. A single female anchor worm can produce hundreds of larvae every two weeks for up to 16 weeks in a 77 degrees Fahrenheit aquarium.</p><p>Anchor worm juveniles can also be spread with the introduction of live plants. Although they may not be on the plants themselves, free-swimming juveniles may be in the water surrounding the plants. Aquatic plants can bring many bacteria and parasites into your aquarium if not properly quarantined. Like your new fish, quarantining plants in a plant-only system will break the parasite life cycle, since there are no fish to host them. This only applies to plants kept with fish. If your new plants have never been kept with any fish, they will be free from fish diseases. Though they may bring over some invertebrate pests, such as snails.</p><h2>Diagnosing Anchor Worms in Fish </h2><p>Since anchor worms are external parasites that attach themselves to the fish, you or your veterinarian can make a visual diagnosis. Oftentimes you will spot what looks like one or more slivers or loose threads dangling from various parts of your fish that you haven't seen before. However, anchor worms can be confused with what looks like algae or plant debris sticking out of the fish. A vet can use a microscope to confirm an infestation.</p><h2>Treatment </h2><p>Anchor worms should be treated because they can proliferate and damage the gills, making it difficult for the fish to breathe. Once anchor worms are present on your fish, it is very tempting to simply pull them off, but resist the urge to do so. Anchor worms need to be removed correctly with a fish under sedation by your veterinarian. They will need to remove the entire parasite including the feeding end from under the fish's skin. Depending on the level of infestation, sedation makes the process less stressful for the fish and allows the veterinarian to work more effectively without a squirming fish.</p><p>Once the mature females have been removed, you may still have a microscopic problem: the juvenile stages. Over-the-counter ""anchor worm"" treatments are usually fairly effective against the juvenile stages, but they will not kill the adults. Another way of killing the free-swimming juvenile stage in the aquarium can be accomplished by removing your substrate and decor and running your water through a UV light.</p><p>Treating anchor worms with organophosphates or diflubenzuron (dimilin) is effective, but needs to be undertaken with severe caution. Only use veterinary-approved products, keep them away from your other pets and children, and make sure to wear proper protection (i.e., gloves) when handling medications.</p><h2>Prognosis for Fish With Anchor Worms </h2><p>The sites of adult attachment may also develop secondary bacterial infections. Monitor these sites carefully after the adults have been removed. They may require treatment with antibiotics, depending on their site and severity. Antibiotics should not be purchased over-the-counter and should only be used when prescribed by a veterinarian. The best method of deterring these secondary bacterial infections is good water quality.</p><h2>How to Prevent Anchor Worms </h2><p>Anchor worms are highly contagious between fish. The best method of preventing anchor worms is properly quarantining any new additions to your aquarium. If you see any anchor worms present in a tank of fish you are looking to purchase, assume they are all infested. Remember, juvenile larvae are microscopic and may be present without you realizing it until it's too late. By properly quarantining your new fish, you will prevent the spread of this problem and other fish diseases to the main aquarium.</p>",975

They can be found in any number of color combinations and can add another dimension to a saltwater aquarium.</p><p>Care for wrasses can be difficult to maintain considering most have strict dietary, substrate, and tankmate needs. Consider this information on wrasses before you decide to add one to your aquarium.</p><h2>Bird Wrasse (Bird Fish) </h2><p>The bird wrasse (bird fish) is a hardy fish which adapts rather well to aquarium life. Only one male, also called green birds for their coloring, should be kept in an aquarium. A male-female pair should be added to the aquarium at the same time, introducing the female, also called a black bird, first.</p><p>Scientifically called Gomphosus varius, bird wrasses all start out as females at birth. In the wild, you will find small groups of black bird wrasses with only one green bird wrasse. If something happens to the male, one or two of the females will start to change into males. It takes several months for the female to complete the change into a male.</p><p>In an aquarium, this fish is an active fish, so give it plenty of room. Also, this bird is a jumper, so secure the tank cover to make sure that no bird fish take flight.</p><h2>Black and White Wrasse (Yellowstripe Coris) </h2><p>The black and white wrasse, more commonly known as a yellowstripe coris, is a carnivore that possesses two prominent teeth in the front of each jaw that is used for feeding on its favorite prey such as snails, hermit crabs, crabs, shrimps, mollusks, and sea urchins. It will eat nuisance bristle worms, but other beneficial worms as well, including decorative tube species.</p><p>Its scientific name is Coris flavovittata. It can be found in the wild in the waters off Japan and the central and west Pacific Ocean. These fish are diggers and substrate rearrangers. They have a tendency to dig themselves into the substrate of the tank to sleep or when threatened, so it is necessary to have an appropriate depth of substrate. </p><h2>Dragon Wrasse (Rockmover Wrasse) </h2><p>The dragon wrasse (rockmover wrasse) is notorious for turning over and moving rocks and corals around to look for food. This can cause damage to desirable organisms. It can also make rock formations to become unstable, which may damage the tank's structure. In a tank setting, Novaculichthys taeniouruseats hermit crabs, snails, and marine worms including bristle worm.</p><p>Dragon wrasse will burrow into the sand to sleep at night and for protection when frightened or harassed. It also will dive into cracks, crevices, and holes in rocks. The dragon wrasse likes room to move so you will need at least a 100-gallon tank for this fish. As well, tightly secure a tank cover, since, upon startling, this fish can jump and might pop out of your tank.</p><h2>Eight-Lined Wrasse (Eightstripe Wrasse) </h2><p>The eight-lined wrasse, also commonly called the eightstripe wrasse (Pseudocheilinus octotaenia)is very shy at first, but once it gets used to being in an aquarium it becomes bolder and will take food out of your hand. The eight-lined wrasse likes to hide, so be sure to give it plenty of cover. As its name implies, it has eight horizontal red stripes or lines on a striking orange body. This wrasse can get aggressive around other wrasses, so it is best to keep it solo.</p><h2>Elegant Wrasse </h2><p>The elegant wrasse (Anampses elegans) is a carnivore that will eat small crustaceans and invertebrates. It is native to the Pacific Ocean from Australia and New Zealand eastward to Easter Island. This species prefers lagoons and can also be found on coastal reefs.</p><p>Be sure to be careful putting any of these animals in with this wrasse or they may become a snack. They will eat shrimp, fish, and other tank fed foods and are a fairly easy wrasse to care for in an aquarium.</p><p>It is suspected that, like many other wrasse species, all juvenile elegant wrasse are all female. Once mature, the dominant female changes sex to a male and will control a school of female fish. If the male disappears, the most dominant female, usually the largest, will change sex and take over the school. Males cannot change back to females and are referred to as terminal males. Terminal males are territorial and swim between groups of females.</p><h2>Four-Lined Wrasse </h2><p>The four-lined wrasse, scientifically classified as Pseudocheilinus tetrataenia, has a bright blue body with four longitudinal bands on the upper part of the body that are bright blue, outlined by fine black lines and an orange color between them.</p><p>These small, active fish are popular for a small marine aquarium. They are quite hardy, disease resistant, and long-lived. These fish will rid a few pests in the aquarium, like the pyramid snails and commensal flatworms. They are considered reef safe as they will not harm corals or coral anemones.</p><h2>Hawaiian Cleaner Wrasse (Cleaner Royal Wrasse) </h2><p>Because the Hawaiian cleaner wrasse's (cleaner royal wrasse) diet is mainly derived from its symbiotic relationship with other fish by eating parasites, it has been reported that this wrasse does not do well in captivity. It is extremely difficult to get this fish to eat any other types of foods, and once the parasite food population is gone, it can result in poor health and most likely death for this wrasse.</p><p>However, if this wrasse is in a healthy environment and offered tank-available foods like mysis shrimp, to begin with, as well as other meaty seafood fares, then it is possible to do well in a marine aquarium of at least 50 gallons in size.</p><h2>Ornate Wrasse (Christmas Wrasse) </h2><p>The ornate wrasse, primarily brightly red and green colored, is an aggressive carnivore. Its main diet consists of small crustaceans and invertebrates. In captivity, Halichoeres ornatissimus will feed on meaty fares such as fresh or frozen seafood, dried, frozen or live brine and mysid shrimp, live grass shrimp, as well as flake foods. It may also nip at polyps and fleshier corals, so it should not be kept in a reef tank. It is recommended that they feed several times a day.</p><h2>Saddleback Wrasse (Jansen's Saddle Wrasse) </h2><p>The saddleback wrasse, also commonly known as Jansen's saddle wrasse, is a beautiful fish with its vibrant blue and green colors and the brownish-orange saddle bar marking around the body behind the head, which gives it its name. When viewed closely you can also see short, vertical, purple-red bars on its body. This species (Thalassoma duperrey) should reside in a 75-gallon or larger aquarium with larger, aggressive tank mates, and plenty of live rock for hiding. It will become territorial and harass any new additions and it should be one of the last additions to the aquarium.</p><h2>Yellowtail Coris Wrasse (Red Coris Wrasse) </h2><p>The yellowtail coris wrasse (Coris gaimard) should be fed a hardy diet of suitably bite-sized pieces of meaty foods that include fresh or frozen seafood, live or frozen brine and mysid shrimp, live grass or ghost shrimp, live black worms, and flake food. Also commonly called a clown wrasse or red labrid, this fish has an extreme and vibrant color transformation from juvenile to adulthood. When very small, these fish are safe with almost any fish that will not eat them, but as they grow, they can become destructive. They should not be kept with invertebrates.</p>",1200
31,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aggressive-aquarium-freshwater-fish-4780459,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Breeds,<h1>Aggressive Aquarium Freshwater Fish</h1>,"<h1>Aggressive Aquarium Freshwater Fish</h1><p>Many freshwater aquarium fish are good community players with fish of similar size and temperament. However, the ones listed here, if not given the right environment, can be very aggressive toward other fish. It's important to know which species will require the upper hand before adding any of these into your aquarium. Here's what type of aggressive behavior to look for as well as which fish are the major offenders.</p><h2>What Does Aggressive Behavior Look Like? </h2><p>There are a few specific examples of what to look for if you think your aggressive fish is harassing other individuals in their tank.</p><h3>Charging/Active Attacking </h3><p>This behavior is easy to note. One fish will charge at the other and either head butt them or bite them. Sometimes, just the threat of an encounter can keep meeker fish hidden for long periods of time.</p><h3>Feeding </h3><p>Much of the competition in an aquarium is either over territory, breeding or food. Aggressive fish may swim around rapidly, eating as much food as they can and stealing it out of the mouths and even gills of other fish. To limit food competition, feed a variety of floating and sinking foods and spread them out throughout your tank using your filter outflow or a powerhead. Observe the fish while feeding to make sure all the fish are getting access to some food.</p><h3>Breeding </h3><p>Depending on the species of fish, some fish parents take a laid back approach, while others defend their unborn young with every ounce of strength they possess. Expect aggressive parents to tag team their attack and make sure to give them plenty of room. They will attack any human hands that come too close to their brood. It is best to separate spawning fish into their own breeding tank.</p><h2>Veil Angelfish (Pterophyllum scalare)</h2><p>As juveniles, these fish can get along together just fine in a group. But, one day, one of the group will start picking on the others and needs to be separated. Then another starts to be the instigator, then another, until all your angelfish are separated. These fish are also viciously protective of their brood, so take extra care with any breeding fish. They have been known to nip at their human caregivers!</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to six inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Black, white, and yellow marbled pattern; long and thin fins with delicate webbing</p><h2>Jack Dempsey (Rocio octofasciatum) </h2><p>A member of the Central American cichlid group, the Jack Dempsey comes in a variety of colors. Given their famous boxing namesake, it is easy to associate these fish as being aggressive. Known for being fierce redecorators, Jack Dempsey cichlids dig into their sandy tank bottoms, uprooting plants and moving smaller décor items. They should not be kept with any smaller fish as they will be eaten. They require a larger tank size.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to ten inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Strong facial features; large oval body with long fins</p><h2>Convict Cichlid (Amatitlania nigrofasciata) </h2><p>Multiple varieties of Convict Cichlids are available, including the Zebra, Black, and Pink. These cichlids are also a Central American species and like to have lots of places to hide in their aquarium. Only topping out around 6 inches long, they can be very aggressive to any smaller fish or even to larger, less-aggressive fish. They will breed in pairs and share the parental care equitably between male and female.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to six inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Multiple black bands running vertically on the body; males have larger dorsal fins than females</p><h2>Red Devil (Amphilophus labiatus) </h2><p>Josh Beasley / Flickr / CC by 2.0</p><p>The Red Devil is another cichlid species aptly named for their aggressive behavior. Growing up to 15 inches in length, these fish are fierce diggers and require 50 gallons per fish. They are well known for knocking down piles of decor, so stack any rocks or branches strategically so they do not fall down on your fish. There are very few fish that can be kept with the Red Devil, due to their extremely aggressive nature. Do not add any fish that cannot defend themselves!</p><p>This fish is commonly confused with the Midas Cichlid , who also is sometimes termed the Red Devil Cichlid.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 15 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Stocky with pointed fins; classic red color</p><h2>Oscar (Astronotus ocellatus) </h2><p>There are many color varieties of Oscar cichlids available to purchase. Some of the most common include the Zebra, Tiger, Red or Lemon. Even though they are all the same species, these fish have been bred over multiple generations to have varying color patterns. These fish are only semi-aggressive towards other fish, but can be very aggressive with their tank décor. Some fish have been known to smash heaters they don't agree with. These fish can grow very large, up to one foot, and need 70 gallons or more per fish.</p><p>To limit ""décor aggression"" it is recommended to keep Oscars in aquariums with a sump. All of the filtration and the heater are maintained in the sump rather than in the aquarium. This will limit the amount of components that have to be kept in the main tank.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to one foot</p><p>Physical Characteristics: White with black, orange, and red outlines and spots</p><h2>Bucktooth Tetra (Exodon paradoxus) </h2><p>bertrand.sant / Flickr / CC by 2.0</p><p>Don't let the ""tetra"" name fool you! Unlike their easy going tetra cousins, the Bucktooth Tetra, also known as the Exodon Paradox, is well known for nipping at their neighbors. They use their sharp, front incisors to grab tiny insects and other fish. These fish are best kept within a group of their own species. A dozen or more is best or else they will fight each other.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to three inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright, metallic silver body with yellow fins, sometimes with orange and red tips</p><p>There are many other fish species that can be aggressive or moderately-aggressive. There are many additional cichlid species that could be added to this list.</p>",972

In fact, many hermit crabs are known to destroy corals, eat other invertebrates, and even eat fish. However, there are some options that can coexist in a reef tank. These hermit crabs are fairly small species that won't disturb the other tank life. They can squeeze into the cracks and crevices that larger crabs can't to eat algae and other debris that otherwise would pollute the tank water.</p><p>Here are nine hermit crab species that are safe for marine reef tanks.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Growing or molting hermit crabs are always on the lookout for a larger shell to settle in, so large snails in your tank might not be entirely safe. Have many empty shells always available for the hermit crabs to choose from. </p><h2>Dwarf Blue Leg Hermit Crab </h2><p>Native to the Caribbean, the dwarf blue leg hermit crab is a great addition to a saltwater aquarium because it eats many kinds of algae, including red slime algae (cyanobacteria). It sifts and aerates the sand as well. This tiny crab likes to live in abandoned snail shells, so it might be a threat to a snail in your tank unless you provide it with empty shells. Members of this crab's genus are sometimes called equal-handed hermit crabs because both claws are the same size.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 1.5 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue legs with red banding and white tips; both claws are of equal size</p><h2>Dwarf Red Tip Hermit Crab </h2><p>The dwarf red tip hermit crab is native to the coastal waters around Central America. In home aquariums, this hermit crab prefers sand in which it can forage and dig. It is known for its scavenger tendencies and will do an excellent job cleaning all the crevices of a tank to control algae growth while aerating the sand. </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 2 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright red face and legs; both claws are of equal size</p><h2>Dwarf Yellow Tip Hermit Crab </h2><p>The striking dwarf yellow tip hermit crab comes from the coastal waters around Vietnam. Its small size allows it to get into all of the nooks and crannies of a reef tank. It's a ravenous algae eater that likes to dig through sand. So it does best in an established tank that has ample algae for it to graze on.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 1 inch</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright yellow bands on green to black legs; both claws are of equal size</p><h2>Dwarf Zebra Hermit Crab </h2><p>The dwarf zebra hermit crab is popular in home aquariums for its distinct coloring. It's native to intertidal regions of the Pacific Ocean. This hermit crab is also a voracious algae scavenger, including for red slime algae. If there's not enough algae in the tank, its diet should be supplemented with dried seaweed.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 1 inch</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Colored pincers; white or orange bands on otherwise dark legs; brilliant blue eyestalks fading into an orange-tinged upper half; larger left claw</p><h2>Polka Dot Hermit Crab </h2><p>The polka dot hermit crab is another algae and leftover food scavenger that can squeeze into tiny areas of a tank to keep them clean. This hermit crab won't bother corals. But it might attack a snail for its shell. So make sure you offer plenty of empty shells in your tank. For the most part, though, it's a peaceful crab.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 1 inch</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Larger right claw; red body with white dots</p><h2>Electric Orange Hermit Crab </h2><p>Keoki Stender</p><p>Originating in the Hawaiian Islands, the electric orange hermit crab is a great addition to a saltwater aquarium because it eats uneaten food, many kinds of algae, and other debris and waste. It also sifts and aerates the sand as it forages. Offer it dried seaweed when there's not enough algae in the tank for it to eat.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 2 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Vivid orange legs with brown bands; blue eyes</p><h2>Halloween Hermit Crab </h2><p>Also native to the Hawaiian Islands, the Halloween hermit crab is named for its vivid orange and red leg bands that make it look like a Halloween decoration. It eats various types of algae, including green hair algae and cyanobacteria, along with leftover food and other debris. It can get relatively large compared to some of the dwarf hermit crabs, so it could potentially disrupt corals in a reef tank. But overall it peacefully coexists in a tank.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: 2 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Alternating orange and red bands on legs; orange eyestalks</p><h2>Scarlet Reef Hermit Crab </h2><p>Native to the Caribbean and Indonesia, the scarlet reef hermit crab is named for its brilliant red body. It's also known as the red reef hermit crab or red-legged hermit crab. This is a hardy and hungry little crab that feeds on algae and debris in reef aquariums. In fact, it specifically likes the types of algae that can be problematic growers in tanks. This hermit crab also is known for its friendly nature toward its fellow tank inhabitants.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 1.5 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Bright red legs; yellow face</p><h2>Elegant Hermit Crab </h2><p>This species from Hawaii is a large hermit crab. Although it won't eat corals, it might damage them by dragging its big heavy shell over them. It also might attack an aquarium snail for its shell if you don't provide empty ones. But it will do an excellent job at keeping the tank's algae growth in check and removing debris and waste. </p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Length: Up to 3 inches</p><p>Physical Characteristics: Blue, red, or yellow knuckles on brown legs; long eyestalks with blue on the lower half and orange on the upper half; larger left claw</p>",926

However, one of the great advantages that marine aquariums have over freshwater aquariums is that there are all sorts of natural critters in the ocean that can be put to work to do a majority of the small-scale cleaning and maintenance for you. Reef-safe ""sand sifters"" are the category of animals that process the sandy substrate at all levels, consuming algae, detritus , and uneaten food without adversely affecting fish, corals or other invertebrates in your aquarium. Be careful to choose the right critters for this important job. Here is a look at eight very different animals and the different ways in which they comb through the sand in your tank.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>For sand sifting fish, select a substrate with a small enough grain size (0.5 to 1.7-millimeter grain size, or sugar-sized) that the fish will be able to process it through the mouth and gills. Do not use large-grained sand, crushed coral, or large size aragonite as the sand sifters will not be able to process this material without injuring themselves.</p><h2>Conchs </h2><p>The tiger sand conch ( sp.) is a popular one. Spending all of their time cleaning and aerating the sand bed, they might even disappear into the bottom for long periods of time (sometimes for months). Completely reef-safe, it will not even harm beneficial sand microfauna, nor will it seriously disturb the beneficial bacterial zones in the sand layers.</p><p>Even as they perform their valuable duty as scavengers and sand sifters, they are also amusing to watch as they dive in and out of the sediments. Adaptable, hardy and benevolent towards its tankmates, just a few conch will make a positive impact on the health and appearance of any aquarium substrate.</p><h2>Hermit crabs</h2><p>Hermit crabs are great sand-stirring invertebrates. Reef-safe hermit crabs spend all of their time looking for and consuming algae and detritus. Smaller species of hermit crabs are preferred over the larger species, as they will not disturb the tank environment when they drag their large, heavy shell homes along the bottom and reef surface.</p><h2>Red Goatfish </h2><p>The docile Goatfishes, especially the red goatfish, are the most charismatic of all of the sand sifters. They really dig in, shovel, and blow sand around as they fish for invertebrates like small worms. Goatfishes have beard-like appendages called ""barbels,"" both long and short, on their lower lip used to taste the sand for sources of food. You may have to move some sand back where it came from as they act a little like a leaf blower!</p><h2>Sea Stars</h2><p>Sand sifting sea stars (starfish) are exceptionally reef-safe; they only provide benefits to your tank. Every marine tank should have one of these long-lived beautiful animals. Sand sifting sea stars generally come from one of two genera of the class Asteroidea (starfishes).</p><p>are the most common, and they are excellent sand bed cleaners, but they can be too good! Some reef enthusiasts choose not to have them, as they can even strip the sand of the beneficial bacteria needed for biofiltration. For this reason, it is not wise to place them in a small aquarium or a new ""clean"" aquarium, where they will likely starve.</p><h2>Sea Cucumbers </h2><p>Segmented into five body parts just like their attractive cousins, the starfish, the ""caterpillar-like"" sea cucumbers are arguably the ugliest animals you can put in a saltwater aquarium. And yet a number of these species do an excellent job of cleaning the sand surface as they inch along at glacial speed. Sea cucumbers will not only consume detritus and uneaten food but also snails and other sand-dwelling critters, so keep an eye on them.</p><h2>Crabs</h2><p>Most marine crabs are well known for having voracious appetites, consuming detritus, uneaten food, and carrion in saltwater aquariums. Unfortunately, most crabs will eat just about anything else in your tank, including healthy corals, invertebrates, and fish.</p><p>However, there are a few reef-safe crabs that will not consume the ""good"" animals in your reef tank. Still, take caution when placing crabs. Even with the ""safe"" crab species, you will occasionally come across a rebel that does not leave corals or invertebrates alone.</p><h2>Gobies</h2><p>Gobies are among the most beautiful and entertaining fish found in saltwater aquariums. Some (not all) gobies process the sand substrate in an aquarium in search of algae and detritus. The sand sifting goby species literally chew the sand, removing the food particles. Then they either spit the sand out of their mouths or eject it out backward through their gills.</p><h2>Snails</h2><p>Different snail species prefer different kinds of food: diatom films, plant-like algae, worms, and detritus. So knowing what your tank is prone to will help you choose the best snails.</p><p>Rock-dwelling snails spend all of their time on the rocks in a saltwater aquarium or even on the glass, avoiding sandy bottoms that are a hazard to them. These snails cannot extend their foot far enough from their shell to turn themselves over if they end up on their ""backs.""</p><p>But there are some great reef-safe sand sifting snails that can flip over when they need to, avoiding starvation and predation; these will happily consume the detritus and algae in your sandy substrate. The Nassarius snail even descends into the sand bed with only their snorkel sticking out. This behavior helps to keep the sand stirred.</p>",876

Based on the most visible spots, it should be called a 7-4 crab, but since 7-11 had a nicer ring to it and its characteristic spots totaled 11, the name 7-11 stuck. This crab adapts quickly to aquarium life. However, it has a destructive nature, so it is not a crab recommended for home aquariums, even if it does look cute and appealing when it's small.</p><h2>Characteristics </h2><p>Carpilius maculatus</p><p>Carpiliuss maculatus, Cancer maculatus</p><p>7-11 crab, brachyura crabs, reef crabs, round crabs, true crabs, blood-spotted crab, blood-spotted round crab, dark- finger coral crab, large-spotted crab, redspot rock crab, red-spotted crab, round reef crab, spotback coral crab and spotted crab, clown crab, alakuma (Hawaiian)</p><h2>Origin and Distribution </h2><p>These crabs are widely distributed in the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, the Hawaiian Islands, Australia, Red Sea, South Africa, and it is also found in areas to the south of mid-Honshu in Japan. Most are found on coral and rocky reefs moving slowly along sandy bottoms.</p><h2>Colors and Markings </h2><p>Its body is an oval shape, its surface is smooth and convex, and it has an orangish-light rust color. It has seven large dark reddish-maroon colored spots on its back. These spots can appear to look more of dark brownish color at times. Its shell is extremely thick and heavy and lacks spines.</p><p>Hawaiian legend says that this crab has its spots because a sea god tried to capture it and eat it, but the crab drew blood. The sea god kept on trying to catch the crab with his bloodied fingers and that's why he has so many red-brownish spots.</p><p>Although most think this crab has 11 spots, which are the most obvious, it actually has a total of 18 spots. It has nine large violet -to-maroon spots on the dorsal surface of its carapace or shell, three on the median region, two on the posterior region, two on the anterolateral region, and two around its eyes. Like most other crabs, one claw grows bigger than the other.</p><h2>Tankmates </h2><p>This crab has very strong pinchers. Once it clamps on to something, it is difficult to try and get it to let go or forcibly open the pincers. It will attack and eat other crustaceans and invertebrates, and if given the chance, it will grasp on to sleeping fish. Males commonly fight for females, with the larger one usually winning. It is not recommended to keep this crustacean with other animals.</p><h2>Habitat and Care </h2><p>The 7-11 crab's great strength and strong armor make it a destructive animal in an aquarium. Its hard shell allows it to act like a bulldozer moving rockscapes and corals around in an aquarium.</p><h2>Diet </h2><p>In the wild, this crab feeds on marine snails. However, like most crabs, the 7-11 is a scavenger and will eat just about anything. This crab has been observed in nature carrying sea urchins and cowrie shells, suggesting a possible food preference. It mostly comes out at night to feed, hiding during daylight hours.</p><h2>Sexual Differences </h2><p>The 7-11 crab is gonochoric, which means it stays one sex, unlike other marine animals that have the ability to switch sex based on the lack of mating partners available. For most crabs, you can tell the difference if it is male or female by looking at the underside of the crab at its abdominal flap. A male crab has a small triangular flap, while a female crab has a broad oval-shaped abdominal flap.</p><h2>Breeding </h2><p>This crab does have a mating courtship ritual, which it uses to woo the target of its desire through olfactory (pheromone) and tactile cues. The male usually waits until the female molts. The male can sense through pheromones released by the female that her molt is imminent. Then, to ensure that he will be the mating partner, he holds her in a close embrace known as amplexus, which literally means ""embrace"" in Latin until she molts.</p><p>This pre-molting embrace may last up to a week, with each crab sternum to sternum, until the female molts. At some point during the later stages of the amplexus the female flips right-side-up, which is preceded by her pinching the male's eyestalks to make him relax his hold. No matter how much eye pinching goes on, at no time does the male completely release the female during her molt. Actual copulation occurs about an hour and a half after the female molts, when the new exoskeleton has firmed somewhat, and with the mating pair back in a sternum-to-sternum position.</p><p>When a male and female crab copulate, the female crab gets a male sperm package, which she stores in her abdominal cavity until her eggs are ready to be released. When the eggs are released, the stored sperm flows over them and they become fertilized. The female crab holds the fertilized eggs in a big spongy mass between its abdominal flap and the body. The eggs are cemented to the pleopods, which are small legs, creating the ""berried"" appearance. To keep the eggs healthy, the female crab continually ""waves"" water over the eggs with the pleopods.</p><p>When the eggs hatch into zoea larvae, they drift away in the ocean currents as plankton. As the crab grows in size, it goes through a series of molts and finally, a process of metamorphosis. Each larval stage, it changes form and function. At each molt, more segments are added to the end (posterior), and the feathered limbs are replaced by the clawed limbs. When it is a megalops, the last stage before metamorphosis and before it becomes a juvenile crab, it most closely resembles the adult crab.</p>",932
95,https://www.thesprucepets.com/common-goldfish-diseases-5200477,Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish & Aquatic Pets > Freshwater Fish Health,<h1>7 Common Goldfish Diseases</h1>,"<h1>7 Common Goldfish Diseases</h1></p><p>Goldfish are susceptible to many freshwater diseases.</p><h2>Poor Water Quality </h2><p>Although not technically a disease, poor water quality is the most common cause of disease in goldfish. Goldfish are messy critters and create a lot of waste and foul water quickly. Inappropriate environments, such as antiquated bowls or severely overcrowded systems, can contribute to chronic stress through poor water quality. A fish unable to escape a toxic system will become chronically stressed, with decrease in growth, immune function, and reproductive capability.</p><p>It is critical to make sure your goldfish have enough space for a healthy life. For comet and other long-bodied goldfish, they will require 20 gallons per fish You will likely need close to 50 to 75 gallons per fish as they mature. Goldfish can grow up to 14 to 16 inches, so plan on that size, not 2 to 3"" inches No fish deserves to live in a filthy bowl. All fish require filtered tanks, but goldfish do require heaters.</p><p>Test your water quality regularly and be sure to correct any abnormalities. Feeding high protein flake food can be a big problem in many goldfish tanks. Always try to feed a pelleted diet in an appropriate size for your fish. If you are having trouble keeping your water quality within range, contact your aquatic veterinarian for additional support.</p><h2>Parasites </h2><p>Bringing a fish home from the pet store is the highest risk point in a fish's life for coming into contact with a parasite. In pet stores, fish from many sources and exposures are mixed in different systems and most parasites can travel in water and on equipment.</p><p>Clinical signs of parasites in goldfish include missing scales, flashing, bruising, lethargy, and/or sudden death.</p><p>The best prevention of parasites is a strict quarantine protocol. There is no ""one size fits all"" treatment for parasites, so a definitive diagnosis from an aquatic veterinarian is critical to ensure proper treatment. Just guessing and throwing a bunch of OTC medications at your fish is a recipe for death.</p><h2>Neurofibromas </h2><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>These ""lumps"" are common in comet goldfish, particularly those kept outdoors. Neurofibromas form from neural tissue deep within skin layers and are nearly impossible to treat. They can commonly form a ""stalk"" and fall off, only to grow back again. Some fish may have one or two localized lumps or disseminated throughout the fish's body.</p><p>Treatment is not warranted due to recurrence. Multiple modalities utilizing surgery and cryotherapy have not been successful. It is not worth putting your fish through difficult treatment that will not resolve the issue. Since these benign tumors arise from neural tissue, there is no treatment currently available that can target these types of tissues specifically.</p><h2>Buoyancy Disorders </h2><p>Goldfish may are prone to both negative and positive buoyancy disorders. Being physostomous fish, they have a pneumatic duct between their esophagus and swim bladder, allowing them to swallow air to inflate their swim bladder. A separate gland, called the oval, is responsible for removing excess air.</p><p>Positive buoyancy disorders occur most commonly after feeding. Goldfish, the golden retrievers of the fish world, who feed vigorously at the surface, will commonly suck in too much air. It will either end up in the GI tract or the swim bladder. After the excess air is removed, the fish goes back to normal. Malfunction of the oval has been known to occur, resulting in permanent positive buoyancy disorders. Surgery is often required to correct these issues.</p><p>Negative buoyancy disorders are most common secondary to stress or poor diet. Simply put, your fish doesn't have the inclination or energy to swim. Once you alleviate the stress and give your fish a proper diet, they will revert to normal behavior. External ""wheelchair"" floats are extremely dangerous and can seriously hurt your fish.</p><h2>Polycystic Kidney Disease </h2><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>Goldfish are prone to a disease that forms cysts in their kidneys, which cause malfunction and serious tissue damage. Unfortunately, the cause of this disease is unknown and there is no treatment. Once the kidneys have been damaged, as in many other species, they do not recover.</p><p>Clinical signs of polycystic kidney disease mostly look like your fish swallowed a baseball, softball or even volleyball. Fish can act normal despite an abnormal external appearance. Ultrasound is required for diagnosis. Do attempt to squeeze your fish! This can cause serious organ damage and will not help your fish in any way.</p><h2>Cloudy Eyes and Popeye </h2><p>Cloudy fish eyes are common secondary to poor water quality, trauma, and secondary disease. Some fish may have eyes that poke out more than their counterparts, especially some fancy varieties, making them more prone to trauma.</p><p>Popeye is a common internet disease for which there is no one treatment. Eyes can become distended from many secondary issues and you should consult with an aquatic veterinarian to get to the root cause quickly and develop an effective treatment plan before the eyes are lost.<br/></p><h2>Red Streaks on Skin and Fins </h2><p>Red streaks on skin and fins are common symptoms of stress and poor water quality. If you see these on your fish, it is important to check your water quality as soon as possible. If it is off, correcting it can resolve these streaky issues.</p><p>If your water quality is within range and no major changes have been recently made, it is critical to identify the stressor and remove it from your system.<br/></p><h2>Non Diseases </h2><p>There are a few diseases out there on the internet that are technically not diseases. They are symptoms of many common fish diseases.</p><h3>""Dropsy"" </h3><p>Dr. Jessie Sanders</p><p>This describes the clinical condition when fluid collects between the scales of a fish and they look like a pinecone. It is a clinical sign of kidney or gill malfunction and is not a disease.</p><h3>""Swim Bladder"" </h3><p>Yes, your fish has a swim bladder. ""Swim bladder"" disease can be many different things and requires a consultation from an aquatic veterinarian. There is no one cause of buoyancy disorders.</p>",1015

The scientific name for this species is .</p><h2>Cleo </h2><p>If you are a fan of old Disney movies, you may already know that Geppetto had a pet goldfish called Chloe in . She was sweet, loyal and loved tickles.</p><p>Just don't expect your goldfish to get on with any resident cats like Cleo does with Figaro in the movie.</p><h2>Dorothy </h2><p>If you have young children in the house, they may enjoy watching 'Elmo's World' on . Elmo has a curious pet goldfish called Dorothy.</p><p>Dorothy lives in a bowl, as a lot of on-screen goldfish do. Don't forget that it is much better to have a bigger, appropriately kitted out tank for your goldfish to help them live a long and happy life.</p><h2>Fin </h2><p>This one certainly should be listed as a classic, as it often ranks on lists of most popular names for fish. It will work especially well if you have a goldfish breed that has a dorsal fin. Not all goldfish have this fin on the top of the body. If you want to pick something more unusual, you could even name your fish Dorsal.</p><h2>Fish out of Water </h2><p>Okay, so it may be a little bit of a mouthful, but you could always shorten it to FOW. This name is inspired by the goldfish best friend of the title character in the Disney movie .</p><p>Despite not being able to understand anything much of what he is trying to say, he is a great character optimistic, fun and friendly.</p><p>Just don't let your kids try to recreate his character being able to come out of his tank!</p><h2>George </h2><p>Why not consider naming your goldfish George, as a tribute to one of the oldest recorded pet goldfish.

They will be the exact opposite of the far-fetched, but still somehow terrifying, giant Great White Shark in the blockbuster movie .</p><h2>Jīnyú </h2><p>This is another unusual name, taken from the translation of the word goldfish. This time it is the Chinese translation. This one is all the more meaningful because China is where the goldfish was first selectively bred over a thousand years ago. They still have a lot of cultural significance in the country, and the species is thought to bring good fortune.</p><h2>Klaus </h2><p>If you have watched the blackly comedic animated sitcom , you will be familiar with the families talking goldfish Klaus Heissler. Klaus was formerly a German Olympic ski-jumper until his brain was transferred into the body of a goldfish.</p><p>Naming your fish after this hilarious, crazed character would certainly be a fun talking point with any visitors!</p><h2>Moby </h2><p>If you are looking to name your goldfish after one of the most famous literary sea creatures around, you can't get much more famous than the character of , in the novel of the same name. The fact that Moby Dick is a Sperm Whale, so totally different in terms of size and species, makes it all the more of an appealing name.</p><h2>Michael </h2><p>Naming your fish Michael, Mick, Mickey or Mike after the famous swimmer Michael Phelps could be an inspired idea.

Catfish are named for their barbels, or ""whiskers,"" which they use to find food in the substrate. Some species of catfish swim in the aquarium like typical fish, but many dwell at the bottom of the aquarium. One species even swims upside down at the top of the aquarium water.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Many species have protective barbs on their dorsal and pectoral fins, so be careful when handling or netting.</p><h2>Pictus Catfish</h2><p>The Pictus Catfish is one of the most common aquarium catfish species. Although they start very small when sold at the fish store, these catfish can grow up to a few feet long in the wild.

The common pleco can typically grow to 18 inches or more, but rubber-lipped plecos and bristlenose plecos will stay at 4-5 inches long.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Suckermouth Catfish, Plecostomos, Pleco</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 3 inches to 2 feet</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Three Stripe Cory</h2><p>The Three Stripe Cory is decorated by a maze of dark black to brown lines all over its translucent, iridescent body. Also known as the Leopard Cory, this species follows the care rules for many , including nocturnal feeding, strict water quality requirements, and preference to being kept in a small school of 3-5 Corys.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: False julii cory, leopard catfish, leopard cory, three-line catfish, three-lined cory, three-stripe cory, trilineatus cory</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 2.5 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 10 years</p><h2>Julii Cory</h2><p>The Julii Cory is almost identical in appearance to the Three Stripe Cory (#7). The key distinction is the consistency of the lines on the fish's head. The Three Stripe Cory will have a fully connected pattern, whereas the Julii Cory will have an interrupted pattern made up of dots. They can be very difficult to differentiate between when the fish are small.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Julii catfish, julii cory, leopard cory</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: Synonym </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 2.5 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years</p><h2>Bristlenose Catfish</h2><p>Also known as the Bristlenose Pleco, this catfish species stays relatively small and will not outgrow its aquarium like other plecostomuses. These catfishes are distinguished by the multiple bristles, or whiskers, surrounding the head, instead of just the mouth. The bristles are larger in the males. Although they will feed on algae and detritus, it is best to feed them a sinking pelleted food to ensure a well-rounded diet. This species also comes in an albino variation, which has darker yellow spots on it light yellow body.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Bristlenose pleco, bristlenose catfish, bushynose catfish, bushy nose</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 5 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5-10 years</p><h2>Pepper Cory</h2><p>The Pepper Cory is distinguished by its mottled black or dark brown body appearance. Although the underside, pelvic, and pectoral fins are white to translucent, the dorsal surface of the fish takes on a shadowed appearance perfect for hiding out from predators during the day. This species is commonly confused with both the Three Stripe and Julii Cory.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Blue leopard corydoras, peppered catfish, peppered cory</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 2 to 3 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years</p><h2>Skunk Cory</h2><p>The Skunk Cory is named for its bold black band running along the dorsal ridge of the fish. It can be confused with the Adolfi Corydoras , which has a similar black band but is interrupted by a vivid orange patch on the head. Like other species, the Skunk Cory does best in small groups and in a tank with lots of places to hide, given their nocturnal nature.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES: Skunk cory, arched cory</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: </p><p>ADULT SIZE: 2 inches</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY: 5 years</p><p>As with any fish species, do your research before adding any fish to a new or established aquarium. Be sure to properly quarantine all new additions, and be sure all fish have enough room and are fed an appropriate diet.</p>",1046

However, on those occasions when a fish does become ill, having information at your fingertips is critical. Here's your one-stop reference about fish health, disease treatment, and prevention. For community aquarium fish, here are the 10 basic rules to follow to keep your fish healthy: </p><h2>Water Testing </h2><p>Before introducing any fish into your aquarium, buy yourself a good water test kit. Ideally, it should contain tests for ammonia, nitrate, nitrite, and pH. Test results, except for the pH, should all read zero before introducing any fish. The pH (acid-base balance) should be 7.0 to 7.8, depending on the species of fish being kept and your local tap water pH. Other water tests that are helpful to have are kits or test strips measuring the water hardness, alkalinity, and chlorine.</p><h2>Temperature </h2><p>Make sure that the temperature in the aquarium is suitable for your chosen occupants. Use an aquarium heater and thermometer to keep the water at the correct temperature of the species of fish you keep.</p><h2>Filtration </h2><p>Filtration is the heart of any aquarium. It's the life source of the environment. There is a variety of filters available at pet stores, including undergravel filters using an air pump or electric water pump to move the water through it, hang on the back power filters, or canister filters that sit below the aquarium. The water flow through the filter should be about four times the water volume of the tank, so a 20-gallon tank should have a filter flow of 80 gallons per hour. The packaging on the filter system should indicate the water flow and the sizes of aquariums it is suitable for.</p><h2>Stocking Levels </h2><h2>Research </h2><p>Learn as much as you can about each species you intend to keep. It is important to know how big the fish will be when it is full-grown, as most fish stores sell immature or young fish. Plan your stocking level based on the adult size of the fish, not the size it is when you purchase it. Also, research if the fish is compatible with other fish you already have; for example, large carnivorous fish would not be good to add in an aquarium with guppies or tetras or other small fish. While the water quality in the fish's natural habitat is important to know if the fish requires special water quality parameters, remember that most freshwater aquarium fish are raised in aquaculture farms now, and not collected from the wild, so the water they are bred and raised in may not be anything like the water they were originally native to.</p><h2>Gradually Introduce Your Fish </h2><p>Introduce fish into your newly set up aquarium gradually. Overloading your aquarium by adding all of the fish as soon as you set it up will cause problems. Remember, your filter will need to build up beneficial bacteria to break down the waste byproducts from your fish. It takes time for the good bacteria to grow, so add fish to new aquariums over 4 to 6 weeks after setting it up.</p><h2>Quarantine New Fish </h2><p>Do you really need to quarantine your new fish in a separate extra tank? The short answer is YES. Introducing new fish into your aquarium will invariably bring disease problems, so why risk it? Set up a small aquarium with a power filter and add some water from the main aquarium, then introduce the new fish in the quarantine tank for a week or so. You should monitor the water quality with your test kit and change the water as needed. It is also helpful to medicate the water to treat any common diseases, such as skin flukes or protozoan parasites. If there are no problems after a week or two, then move the fish into the main aquarium.</p><h2>Feeding </h2><p>Twice daily is enough for feeding adult fish, and maybe more for young fish. Only feed as much food each time as will be eaten within 3 to 5 minutes, otherwise, excess food will decompose at the bottom of your aquarium, causing other problems such as high ammonia, phosphate and nitrate, and possibly unsightly algae growth.</p><h2>Water Changes </h2><p>Perform regular water changes, around 10-15 percent every 1-2 weeks. Use a gravel vacuum to remove the water and debris on the bottom of the aquarium, then refill with dechlorinated water at the correct temperature. It's good for your aquarium and your fish! Water changes remove ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate and replenish the alkalinity in the water, to help stabilize the pH.</p><h2>Clean Filters </h2><p>Clean your filters regularly according to the manufacturer's instructions. Avoid cleaning the sponge media in raw tap water; rather, use some of the water siphoned from the aquarium so the beneficial bacteria are not killed on the filter media and only the debris is cleaned away. If the aquarium filter has media that needs to be changed, don't change all of it at the same time so that the beneficial bacteria aren't depleted. Change only one media at each filter cleaning.</p>",867
