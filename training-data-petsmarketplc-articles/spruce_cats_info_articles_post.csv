Cats may often knead soft household items, such as pillows and blankets, or they may prefer kneading the chest, stomach area, and arms and legs of their human companions. While there are several theories that could explain this behavior, many cat companions interpret kneading as a sign of affection and emotional attachment. This may not be too far off the mark, given that kneading harkens back to the deep-seated instinctual behavior that occurs between mother cats and their kittens.</p><p>More than 58 million cats live in United States households, and having a close, loving relationship with a cat benefits both the human and the feline involved. Cat behavior can also be puzzling to humans. (It's not as easy to interpret as the behavior of dogs, which has been extensively studied and documented in scientific literature.) Cats are misconceived as aloof and independent, but they actually operate naturally within more flexible social structures. These social structures encompass being communal and strongly independent at different times, depending on their life experiences and current environment.</p><p>Studies of cat behavior show they form strong attachments to their human caregivers. In one study, 65% of cats formed secure bonds with their human caregivers, a rate that 's on par with similar studies in dogs and human infants. Kneading may be one distinctive behavior cats have adapted from their communication repertoire to demonstrate or reinforce this bond with theirpeople.</p><h2>What is Kneading in Cats?</h2><p>Kneading is the rhythmic movement of a cat 's front paws where they flex and press their toes and pads back and forth on a soft object, alternating from paw to paw. The action resembles the motions a baker uses when kneading bread, which results in the behavior's common nickname of making biscuits."" Kneading may also be referred to as making muffinsor happy paws. </p><p>Many cats purr while kneading and may appear to be intensely focused on the task. Some cats may also rhythmically kick their back feet and twitch their pelvis while kneading. Cats knead either with their claws-inserting them into the object and then retracting them-or without.</p><p>Cats may have a favorite blanket or soft toy they routinely knead, or they may knead a variety of soft surfaces without showing a strong preference for any of them. Cats commonly knead the people they live with, often choosing a person 's stomach, chest, or legs. Cats may also knead other animals in the household, including other cats and dogs.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Knead?</h2><p>There are several hypotheses about why cats knead, and it 's likely that kneading serves different purposes for cats depending on their life stages, environment, and context.</p><p>Kneading is one of the first behaviors kittens demonstrate as newborns. They will knead on their mother 's abdomen to stimulate milk letdown so they can nurse. It is possible that, in domestic cats, this early behavior established in kittenhood has been carried over into cat-human caregiver relationships. Cats recognize a type of familial bond with their caregivers-even those who aren't felines.</p><p>Kneading may also be related to feelings of wellbeing and contentment in cats. Cats may knead because they feel secure and happy in their environment. Kneading can also be performed as a self-soothing behavior to make the cat feel better when stressed or anxious.</p><p>Another reason cats knead may be to mark their scent. Cats have scent glands in their paws, which release chemicals called pheromones that are important for marking their territory and sending messages to other animals. Cats release these pheromones when they perform behaviors like scratching on trees and posts, leaving their scent markers behind. The same goes for kneading. Humans can 't smell these pheromones, but other cats can. </p><p>In addition to territorial marking, kneading may be related to other behaviors handed down from cats ' wild ancestors. It may be a sign of bedding down or nesting behavior, and wild cats may have used it to pat down grass and leaves to create a comfortable bed. Today 's domestic cats may still carry out this behavior before they are ready to settle down for a nap. </p><p>Kneading may also serve an important function in keeping a cat 's claws, feet, and paw pads healthy by stretching and flexing them-similar to the way people perform regular stretching exercises to maintain physical fitness.</p><p>Unspayed female cats will lay on their sides and knead when they are going into heat, which indicates they are entering a period that's receptive to breeding.</p><h2>Is Kneading Normal?</h2><p>Kneading is a normal behavior in cats that is important for their health and wellbeing and is generally not a cause for concern. When a cat kneads a person, it can be a pleasant bonding experience for both and shows that the cat is comfortable and happy around that person.</p><p>Sometimes kneading can damage items like sweaters, pillows, and blankets because cats pull on the threads with their claws. If this occurs, never punish the cat or abruptly stop their kneading. Rather, gently redirect the cat to another item by slowly inserting it under their paws while taking the other item away from them. Alternatively, you can move them to a different blanket, pillow, or toy by slowly and gently moving their body onto the other item. Set aside a special blanket or towel for the cat's kneading, and put away other items you don 't want damaged when they are not being used.</p><p>When cats use their claws to knead, this can be painful to the person being kneaded. Again, the cat does not intend for this action to be harmful and should never be punished for using claws when kneading. Placing a thick blanket or other soft item between your skin and the cat can protect from discomfort or scratches when your cat is kneading. Keeping your cat 's nails trimmed or using plastic nail caps will also help prevent discomfort or injury.</p><p>In rare cases, cats may suddenly change their kneading behavior. If they're meowing in an unusual ways while kneading or exhibiting aggressive behavior toward people or other cats in the house, this can indicate a medical or behavioral problem. If your cat 's behavior changes suddenly, always consult your veterinarian to make sure there isn 't an underlying physical ailment that requires treatment. Your veterinarian can also advise you if your cat is showing any concerning behavior changes</p>",1061
1,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-leave-adult-cat-alone-554826,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Rejecting a New Kitten</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Rejecting a New Kitten</h1><p>Some cats take to new kittens right away. Others need a lot of time to get used to a new kitty or may never fully adjust. A lot of this depends on how old and well socialized your cat is when it's introduced to your new family member.</p><p>Although cat behavior may be difficult to understand at times, looking to their wild relatives can offer some insight as to why cats sometimes have trouble coexisting.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Reject New Kittens?</h2><p>Domesticated house cats are closely related to wild cats. There are a number of differences, but these groups still have some similar characteristics and instincts, including how they coexist with other cats.</p><p>Wild felines, such as bobcats, lynx, and servals, are typically solitary animals. They're rarely seen, naturally secretive, and nocturnal. During the day, they hide in dens, and they come out at night to hunt for food alone.</p><p>Feral cats (domesticated cats that have grown up in the wild) also hunt and sleep alone. However, they may form a colony led by a female cat (queen) if food is being provided to them by people. Colonies are generally made up of related cats. Male cats (toms) usually leave the colony when they are a few years old.</p><p>This social hierarchy is different from that of the average house cat. That's because house cats are usually spayed and neutered, often not well socialized with other cats, and live in a very isolated environment away from other cats. This can present a problem when you want to bring a new kitten or cat into the family. In addition, feral cats usually live in colonies of genetically related cats that are born into the colony. It is uncommon for unrelated cats to join their ranks, and when they do, they usually live on the outskirts of the colony for several months before they are fully accepted.</p><p>Sometimes, giving your cat time to adjust to a new kitten is what's needed. But if your cat was not well socialized before the age of 3, it may be very difficult for it to get along with a new kitten. In reality, some cats are better off being the only cat in a home.</p><h2>How to Stop Rejection</h2><p>When you bring a new kitten home, it's important to slowly introduce it to your cat. Whether you've done that or not, if the cats aren't getting along, there are a few steps you can take to try to break the ice.</p><h2>Food Bowls</h2><p>Make sure the kitten has its own food and water bowls that are not in the same location as your cat's bowls. Feed them in separate areas so your cat doesn't become territorial about its own food and your kitten gets a chance to eat. If you need to, feed one of the cats in a separate room and close the door.</p><h2>Sleeping Areas</h2><p>Provide separate sleeping areas for both cats. Don't try to give your cat's old beds or condos to the new kitten. Your older cat has already established possession of these and won't take kindly to a kitten using them without permission.</p><h2>Observation Areas</h2><p>Cats usually deal with ""intruders"" by trying to avoid them, and only display overt aggression as a last resort. Your cat should have a safe place to get away from the new kitten until they have gotten comfortable with each other. Provide your older cat with areas outside the kitten's reach where only it can go. A high perch, for instance, can be a good place for your cat to observe the kitten for a while. Also, these places can be a good retreat when your cat needs to get away from an aggressive or annoying kitten.</p><h2>Litter Boxes</h2><p>Make sure you have one more litter box than you have cats. This means that if you have two cats, you should have three litter boxes. There should be no direct line of sight between the boxes in case both your older cat and new kitten are in different boxes at the same time.</p><h2>Pheromones</h2><p>Purchase sprays, wipes, and diffusers containing special feline pheromones and use them as long as necessary. These pheromones help cats feel relaxed and safe and may benefit both your new kitten and older cat during the introduction phase.</p><h2>Treats</h2><p>Pet your new kitten and, at the same time, allow your older cat to sniff you while you give it its favorite treats. This may help to teach your cat that the scent of the new kitten is not a bad thing. Over time, your older cat may start to associate the smell of the kitten with treats, making it a positive scent. Do the same thing when you see your kitten and cat interacting nicely to reinforce their desirable behavior.</p><h2>Separation</h2><p>Cats should not be allowed to be together unsupervised until they have had several direct interactions without any issues. If you're unable to monitor your cat and kitten and are worried about one hurting the other, make sure they're safely separated. A bathroom with a litter box, bed, and bowl of water can be where the new kitten stays when you're away at work or asleep at night. This is especially helpful if your kitten won't leave your older cat alone.</p><h2>Keep Things Calm</h2><p>Sometimes unusual things that scare a cat will cause it to show displaced aggression toward a new kitten. Cats are creatures of habit, so don 't make major household changes while introducing the new kitten. This includes such changes as renovating your kitchen, ripping up carpeting, or having a party with fireworks in the backyard.</p><h2>Don 't Allow Fights</h2><p>While they may want to fight, don't allow your cat to do anything more than hiss and swat at the kitten. If you're concerned that a fight is about to happen, distract the cats with a loud clap of your hands or a quick squirt of water. If your cats do fight, they should be separated for a period of time, and then slowly reintroduced to each other over a period of several days to weeks.</p>",1001
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-behavior-myths-decoded-4686996,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>Cat Behavior Myths Decoded</h1>,"<h1>Cat Behavior Myths Decoded</h1><p>Cats are one of the most popular pets yet they are often misunderstood. This is, in part, due to the many myths and stereotypes that are commonly shared about cats. It's time to separate fact from fiction by dispelling four common myths about cats.</p><h2>Myth: Cats Can 't Be Trained</h2><p>There is a common misconception that cats cannot be trained, or that training them is more difficult than with dogs. Both of those statements are false and can be detrimental when a cat owner believes them. When owners feel that their cats cannot be trained, they also believe their cat's behavioral problems cannot be resolved. This can often result in fatal consequences for cats, including euthanasia and relinquishment.</p><p>The truth is that many feline behavior problems can be resolved, and they are easy to train. Cats can be taught foundation behaviors (targeting, attention), positive husbandry behaviors (nail trims, brushing, and handling), and fun tricks (roll over, high five).</p><p>When training cats, focus on the good, meaning, focus on the positive behaviors and build upon those instead of telling an animal what not to do. Positive training methods accelerate learning since animals can better understand what we are asking of them instead of repeatedly telling them no. These methods also help to not only keep training fun for both the teacher and the learner but also creates enthusiastic learners and encourages creativity along with strengthening the human animal bond.</p><p>Using something the cat doesn 't like (i.e. spraying with water, shocking, yelling, hitting) to stop the behavior is not recommended. This does not teach the cat the wanted behavior (the cat learns to wait until you are not around before engaging in the behavior), does not effectively communicate with your cat what you do want, can increase fear and anxiety, and can cause the cat to be fearful of you and damage the human-animal bond.</p><h2>Myth: When Your Cat Shows You Their Belly, They Always Want You to Pet Their Belly</h2><p>Many people see this and take it as an invitation to rub their cat 's belly, but in most cases, that is not what the cat is communicating to you when she exposes her abdomen.</p><p>Cats sometimes roll on their back to show a defensive posture. When a cat feels that she cannot get away, she will roll on her back to better use her claws and teeth against a predator. A cat 's abdomen is a very vulnerable area because it holds many vital organs. Do not take it personally if your cat scratches or bites you when you rub her belly.</p><p>A cat laying on her back exposing her abdomen in a familiar setting like her home, can also often communicate that she is relaxed and feels safe in her environment. The cat feels so comfortable that she will lie on her back and expose their vital organs instead of watching for predators.</p><p>Additionally, cats can lie on their backs when they want to play. This is the time to take out the feather wand or their favorite catnip kicker. Avoid using your hands and feet to play with your cat because we want to teach her appropriate play and that your hands and feet are never toys to attack.</p><p>The best approach when you see your cat showing her abdomen is to keep your hands clear. If you do pet your cat while her abdomen is exposed, avoid petting the abdomen and pet her shoulders, head, and chin, petting only pet a few times. Monitor your cat 's body language, and at first sight of agitation or over-arousal, give her space and stop petting. Common signs of over-arousal are tail twitching and lashing, ears and whiskers back, skin twitching, hair standing on the body or tail, and a fixated look.</p><h2>Myth: Kittens Don 't Need Socialization</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, it is as important for kittens to be properly socialized and trained as it is for puppies.</p><p>Cats have a socialization period during the first weeks of life, falling between 2 and 7 weeks of age. During this period, they are learning what is safe and unsafe in their environment. Some certified cat behavior consultants, veterinary hospitals, and animal shelters even offer kitten socialization classes, often called kitten kindergarten.</p><p>Poor socialization can result in hiding from visitors, fearing other pets, adapting slowly to new environments, and feeling fearful and aggressive with handling at veterinary visits. These cats are more likely to become stressed and/or fearful and start urinating out of the box, which can result in the human-animal bond being damaged and owners relinquishing their cats.</p><p>However, well-socialized kittens who have received positive experiences around many different people, unfamiliar kittens, environments, and handling procedures are more likely to be outgoing, social, and have better coping skills, which will result in stronger human-animal bonds and fewer behavioral issues. These kittens are also more likely to receive annual veterinary care, since owners won't be afraid to take their cats to the vet.</p><h2>Myth: Cats Act Out of Spite</h2><p>Unlike humans, cats do not act out of spite. Anthropomorphism is defined as the attribution of human characteristics to an animal or object. We commonly interpret animals' feelings based on what we see as human body language and not cat body language.</p><p>It 's natural for us to do this because we want to relate to our cats and this can help to create bonds to animals but can also be harmful.</p><p>For example, if an owner thinks their cat(s) are going to the bathroom outside of the litter box out of spite, they are more likely to approach this issue negatively, which will escalate the issue and damage the bond with their cat.</p><p>If they address the actual causes (stress, fear, anxiety, medical issue), the owners will approach the issue empathetically and get the cat the help they need to resolve the issue.</p>",965
3,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-cats-hate-water-4245228,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>Reasons Why Cats Hate Water</h1>,"<h1>Reasons Why Cats Hate Water</h1><p>Not all cats dislike water. Cats who have had positive experiences around and in water, especially during their key socialization period (early socialization occurs between 3 and 8 weeks, late socialization between 9 and 16 weeks), often like water. There are also specific breeds that love water! It's important to treat your cat as an individual without any expectations.</p><h2>Many Cats Evolved to Dislike Water</h2><p>It is believed that cats were domesticated 9,500 years ago in the middle east. They evolved in arid desert climates and were not exposed to rivers, lakes, and rain. This resulted in present day cats mostly avoiding bodies of water. Even community cats often seek shelter from rain and thunderstorms. Hiding from water has become an instinct in present day cats.</p><p>This is not true of all breeds though, as some breeds of cats enjoy being in the water due to their own evolutionary background. The Turkish Van and the Turkish Angora, for example, are known for their love of water and swimming abilities. They adapted to their climate in the Lake Van region of Turkey by shedding their hair in the summer to swim and fish. Some other breeds that are more likely to enjoy water are the Bengal, Maine Coon, and American Bobtail.</p><h2>Cats Are Sensitive to Scents</h2><p>Cats have an extraordinary sense of smell, fourteen times more sensitive than ours. The strong scents associated with shampoos and conditioners can contribute to cats aversion to water and baths. Some have also speculated that your cat may not like the scent of chemicals from tap water.</p><h2>Cats Love to Be Clean and Warm (The Wet Factor)</h2><p>Cats are meticulous in their natural cleanliness and spend much of their time grooming themselves by keeping their fur clean, detangled, and well-conditioned. Cats also maintain a higher body temperature and cleaning themselves helps maintain and regulate their body temperature. When a cat's coat becomes soaked, it becomes quite heavy, making it hard for them to return to a dry, warm state quickly. A wet coat can also make the cat feel slow and not as nimble as usual, which results in an uncomfortable sensation of not being able to quickly get out of a situation.</p><h2>Aversion to Water</h2><p>Many cats' experiences with water are not positive-being stuck in a downpour without shelter, being sprayed with water, and forced baths are a few examples-so it 's understandable why many cats do not like water.</p><h2>Do Cats Need Baths?</h2><p>As aforementioned, cats do a wonderful job of keeping themselves clean and can spend up to 40% of the day cleaning themselves, so you may never need to bathe your cat.</p><p>Cats may need a medical bath due to a skin issue and senior, arthritic, and overweight cats may have a hard time reaching certain parts of their body. A bath may also be necessary if the cat happens to roll in something sticky or smelly.</p><h2>How Can I Get My Cat to Enjoy Baths?</h2><h3>Before the Bath</h3><p>Acclimate to the space. To get your cat comfortable with water, try acclimating her to the tub weeks before a bath, so she can get used to the space. Place your cat in an empty tub or sink with toys, catnip, or treats so that she makes positive associations with the location. Try spreadable treats, like a small amount of squeeze cheese, whip cream, or anchovy paste, and spread it on the tub for your cat to lick.</p><p>Once your cat is comfortable with playing and eating treats in the sink or tub, fill the tub with an inch or two of warm water and scatter toys throughout the bath so she can have some fun with it. Encourage your cat to play with the toys and reinforce her with praise and treats when she does.</p><p>Have everything ready prior to bathing the cat. Be sure to be prepared with everything you need. This includes shampoo specifically made for cats, special treats and toys your cat loves, warm towels, a plastic cup for pouring water over your cat, and a non-slip surface, such as a rubber liner, and a bath mat or towel to place in the sink or bathtub for your cat to stand on.</p><p>Create a calm environment. Close the door and keep noises to a minimum. Be calm and speak softly. If your spray attachment is noisy, rinse your cat with cups of water instead. If you are stressed, your cat will be too!</p><h3>During the Bath</h3><p>Use minimal restraint and positive distractions. Avoid scruffing and holding your cat down. Instead, be gentle, watch your cats body language, and provide positive distractions, like a special spreadable treat and/or a wand toy.</p><p>Use extra care not to spray the face or get water in the ears or eyes. Avoid washing the whiskers. A cat's whiskers are where many of the cat 's touch receptors are located and it's only natural for cats to hate getting these receptors grazed by water, food, and dirt. Be sure to rinse shampoo thoroughly to prevent skin irritation.</p><h3>After the Bath</h3><p>Towel dry. Gently lift your cat out of the water and immediately wrap up in a warm towel to dry or, if your cat does not prefer to be carried, allow water to drain out and towel dry while still in tub. Your cat will dry naturally in a few hours and in that time, they should be kept warm and away from drafts. End this with a cat cuddle or play session and your cat's favorite treat!</p>",905
4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-cats-like-shoes-4772363,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>Why Do Cats Like Shoes?</h1>,"<h1>Why Do Cats Like Shoes?</h1><p>Cat owners may have noticed that their cats have an obvious obsession with shoes, whether that be sniffing them, batting at them, and even sleeping on, in, or near them. Why do cats love sleeping on shoes so much? Why do some cats even move shoes from their homes by the front door and hide them away elsewhere?</p><h2>Why Do Cats Sit On Shoes?</h2><p>There are legitimate reasons behind why cats find shoes so fascinating, and understanding these reasons can help curb any shoe-related issues in the future.</p><h3>Familiar Smells</h3><p>For a cat, their sense of smell is probably the most important of their five senses. It is fourteen times as strong as a person's and they have twice as many olfactory receptors in their nasal tissue as people do. They also have a specialized organ located in the roof of the mouth called a Jacobson's organ (sometimes referred to as a vemeronasal organ) that people completely lack. This organ allows cats to, essentially, taste the scents and pheromones in the air, giving them a multitude of information about the animals and people in the area. Cats are naturally inquisitive and will investigate new smells, but will also seek out the smells of things that are familiar to them and that make them feel safe and at ease.</p><h3>Claimed Territory</h3><p>Cats themselves create and secrete their own uniquely scented pheromones in glands throughout their body, including their cheeks. When your cat rubs their face up against you or an object (otherwise known as bunting), they are leaving their mark as a way to say, 'I've been here before. This belongs in my space and makes me feel safe.' Cats will gravitate to things that smell like them and like the ones that they love. Sleeping on your shoes is simply your cat's way of saying they are comfortable in your company, are put at ease by your presence, and love you!</p><h3>Comfort Zones</h3><p>Your cat may not be just sleeping or spending time on your shoes to tell you that they love you, though. Objects that smell like you-articles of clothing, shoes, blankets-can bring your cat comfort in stressful situations. Sleeping on your shoes could very well be a method of self-soothing for your cat while you are away during the day. It may even be why your cat doesn't just stop at resting on your shoes where you leave them but may move your shoes to another location. Your cat may take your shoe, acting as a security blanket, to a favored resting area as a way of keeping a part of you close by. If your cat was bottle-raised, they may even suckle on your shoes or socks. This is because cats that are weaned too soon from their mother often develop an oral fixation and nibble or suckle on things that smell like their owner. This behavior is another method of self-soothing and shoes that are left on the floor for easy access are a convenient outlet for it.</p><h2>Reclaiming Your Shoes</h2><p>Of course, just because you can now understand the of your cat's shoe obsession and can even see how it is a way of showing their appreciation for you, that doesn't make it any less frustrating when you are running late and your cat has run off with one of your shoes. Having to constantly seek out your shoes because your cat keeps moving them can get pretty old pretty quickly. Trying to convince your cat to leave your shoes alone, though, can be an uphill battle.</p><h3>Store Away Shoes</h3><p>Preventing your cat from having access to your shoes can be a lot easier than trying to stop the behavior altogether. Keeping your shoes stored away in a closet or in a sealed plastic bin can be a quick solution. Remember that cats are very good at climbing, so simply storing them up on a high shelf might not be enough to make your shoes inaccessible.</p><h3>Redirect Attention</h3><p>If blocking your cat's access to your shoes isn't feasible, you may be able to redirect your cat to another item that still smells like you but might not be missed as much by you. Something like an old T-shirt or sock would be a good substitution. If you catch your cat in the act of trying to steal your shoe, try to avoid startling them with shouting or acting in a way that can seem aggressive. These actions will only act to startle your cat and they may not associate your shouts of frustration with their shoe thievery. Even if your cat drops the shoe in alarm, they may not fully understand why you were so upset.</p><p>While shoes don't seem like they would be a comfortable hangout spot to us, cats think they are great because they remind them of their favorite people. The next time you catch your cat snoozing on your sneakers, snap a picture for posterity's sake, offer them a blanket instead, and revel in the fact that your cat just told you they love you.</p>",833
5,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-things-cats-hate-554081,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>7 Things People Do That Cats Hate</h1>,"<h1>7 Things People Do That Cats Hate</h1><p>Does your cat seem upset or anxious? Do its body signals seem negative or is it practicing inappropriate bathroom habits?</p><p>What's bothering your cat could very well be something that bothers you, too. From dirty bathrooms to spoiled food to too loud music, cats and humans share more pet peeves than you may think. And believe it or not, you could be making some mistakes as an owner, unknowingly causing these top things cats can't stand. Don't worry-we've got your back-here's how to remedy them.</p><h2>Cats Hate Feeling Lonely</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, cats are not solitary animals! It 's true that you can leave your cat alone for longer bouts than you could a dog, but kitties crave attention, companionship, and love just like any other furry friend-or human. If left alone for extended periods of time, it can become agitated and develop feelings of anxiety and even depression.</p><p>If you have a busy schedule, be sure to set aside a few minutes each day to spend some quality time with your cat. Even 15 minutes of playtime every few hours will keep it happy and healthy. An even better solution? Consider adopting another cat, so it has a full-time companion.</p><h2>Cats Hate Dirty Litter Boxes</h2><p>Using a dirty toilet-in public or in a home-is pretty gross, right? Well, cats feel the same way about dirty litter boxes.</p><p>It 's important to clean out your cat 's litter boxes every day, or at least every other day, depending on the number of cats you have and their bathroom habits. Don 't want to scoop poop daily? Consider investing in a self-cleaning litter box.</p><p>Keeping a clean litter box isn 't just about scooping either. Depending on the type of litter you use, the frequency with which you scoop it, and the number of cats in your household, litter should be replaced about every two weeks.</p><h2>Cats Hate Spoiled Food</h2><p>You probably don 't want to dig into a big plate of spoiled food-and surprise!-neither does your cat. Not only does raw or spoiled food taste bad, but it can make your cat sick, too. Bacteria such as and can grow in food that 's been exposed for too long, especially in the warmer months.</p><p>Whenever you 're serving up your kitty 's meals, be sure to check the expiration dates on both wet and dry food. If you find yourself saving lots of leftovers after your cat 's meals, you may need to assess how much it actually needs to be eating. Your veterinarian can help you decide based on his breed, age, and activity levels.</p><h2>Cats Hate Yucky Medicine</h2><p>When you 're feeling lousy, the last thing you want to do is down some yucky tasting medicine. And the same holds true for your cat. When taking medication, many cats foam at the mouth, or just spit it back out.</p><p>Whether your cat needs medication for a cold or infection or has a chronic condition that requires the ongoing administering of medication, it 's vital to make the experience a bit more palatable for kitty.</p><p>First, train your cat to be comfortable having its face and mouth handled; associate the sensations with something positive by rewarding it with a small treat. Then, establish a medication schedule, so it knows what to expect and when.</p><p>If you 're still having issues with administering pills, there are lots of soft treats with pockets designed for holding pills.</p><h2>Cats Hate Overly Aggressive Petting</h2><p>If you have a cat, you know there are only certain areas it will allow you to pet-and if you pet the wrong part, it will hiss, scratch, or bite. Cats can be extremely sensitive to tactile stimuli, so it 's important to be aware of where and how you 're petting them.</p><p>Want to keep your cat happy? Cats groom each other on the head and neck-and seriously dislike ""full-body"" pets down the length of their backs-so try to stick to the areas around its head and neck only. Pay close to attention to its behavior and body signals to understand acceptable and unacceptable petting.</p><h2>Cats Hate Competition From Other Cats</h2><p>Whether battling over food, space, toys or their humans ' attention, cats can become jealous of one another. Unfortunately, in some cases this jealousy or resource guarding can manifest as aggression and, depending on the situation, misdirected aggression.</p><p>For example: If a house cat feels threatened by an outdoor cat, but can 't attack it, the house cat may redirect his aggression toward another cat inside the house.</p><h2>Cats Hate Loud Noises</h2><p>From thunderstorms to arguments to fireworks, lots of loud noises and commotion can seriously stress your cat out. And chronic stress from loud noises can cause a number of behavioral and health issues, including skittishness, aggression, or depression, as well as hair loss, lack of appetite, and over-grooming.</p><p>It can be tough, but try to limit your cat 's exposure to loud noises. Keep it in a quiet, safe space when guests are over or during bad weather and avoid playing very loud music or cranking up the volume on the TV.</p>",839

Siamese heritage cats and young kittens, in particular, enjoy retrieving toys, though any cat can learn it.</p><p>Your cat may even show an instinct to retrieve when, for instance, it brings you a mouse as a ""gift."" It may also capture a fluttering moth only to let it go or bat a toy mouse down the hall. The only other element needed is for the human to do the honors and toss the toy, then entice the cat to bring it back.</p><p>Teaching this game is a good interactive way to help your cat release some energy and remain mentally sharp. Fetch can also offer exercise to slim down tubby tabbies. Not every cat will fetch, but it is a fun game to attempt with your cat and there are a few simple steps you can take to encourage it.</p><h2>Find a Quiet Spot</h2><p>When you want to keep your cat's attention and teach it something new, it's often best to do it in a distraction-free environment. Find a quiet spot in the home, preferably a room with few obstacles and a small area that restricts the playing field.</p><h2>Choose the Right Toy</h2><p>Most kitties choose their favorite things to fetch. You'll find it easiest to follow your cat's natural preferences when introducing the game of fetch.</p><p>For instance, your cat may be most interested in a catnip mouse, a wad of paper, a soft sparkle ball, or even a particular treat. Some cats even enjoy chasing kibble across a hard floor. Though they may not bring it back, they might return to ""ask"" for another toss. Figure out what your cat will go after most, then play with that toy.</p><h2>Pick the Right Time</h2><p>Timing is key and you know your cat's habits best, so choose a time when you know kitty is up for a game. Even if it's convenient for you, the game will go nowhere when your cat is down for the count during naptime. Some cat owners find that their cat is most receptive to training and willing to pay attention to them just before a meal.</p><p>While dogs tend to go nuts with fetching marathons, remember that cats are masters of the sprint and dash. Ten minutes is a long time in cat-world, and you want to leave your cat wanting more. Stop the game before the cat calls it quits-five minutes is good for most cats-and it will be more likely to ask for a repeat.</p><h2>Play Copy Cat</h2><p>Does your cat want the ball to bounce or does it prefer to paw-wack paper across the room? Make like a cat and copy its favorite playtime activities. It will show your pet that you understand the game and want to join the fun.</p><h2>Give the Game a Name</h2><p>Cats speak with fluffed fur, eye and tail positions, and meows, but they certainly understand a variety of human words, too. Link the action to a word to help your cat understand each time the game's at hand.</p><p>Say something like, ""Fetch, kitty-kitty-kitty!"" in a high-pitched, happy tone after you've tossed the toy across the room to entice your cat to bring back the toy. If your cat has already been clicker trained to come when called, use your ""come"" command linked to the ""fetch"" word.</p><h2>Reward the Action</h2><p>For cats that fetch naturally, simply picking up the toy and tossing it again is often enough of a reward. If kitty enjoys chasing kibble or other treats across the floor, the reward is eating it. Other cats may be more inclined to repeat the game of fetch if you offer an actual treat. Again, follow your cat's lead and offer whatever reward it likes best to encourage good behavior.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>As your cat gets used to the game, move it into a larger room or an area with more distractions. You can also get another person involved: Sit on opposite sides of the room and take turns throwing the toy between each other. This can help your cat learn that it's fun to play with other people as well.</p><p>You may find it best to keep the toy you play fetch with out of your cat's reach when you're not playing. This can add value to the toy and help make your time playing the game something your cat looks forward to.</p><p>Once your cat is repeatedly fetching one object, try tossing another toy and use the same verbal cue to entice it to fetch. Ensuring your cat will retrieve a variety of objects is a good way to encourage exercise even if that prized possession gets lost or damaged and needs to be replaced.</p><p>If your cat couldn't care less about fetching, don't despair. You can still have great fun with other kitty games and interactive toys. Plus, some cats may simply think humans need to pick up after themselves, instead of expecting the cat to bring it back. They're funny like that.</p>",831

For something so small and scentless, that little red dot sure can keep cats busy-in spite of (or perhaps because of) the fact that they never really can catch it. Interestingly though, there 's some debate about whether or not laser pointers are a great toy for our feline friends. So why do cats chase lasers, and is it time to ditch the laser in favor of a different type of toy?</p><h2>The Allure of the Laser</h2><p>Lasers are inherently stimulating to cats because of what they represent: fast-moving prey. Just because your cat doesn 't have to work hard for its food (unless you count all the effort it takes to meow all morning until you fill up its bowl), doesn 't mean that it 's not hardwired for the job.</p><p>As the dot of a laser darts around the room, your cat interprets it as a small animal trying to run and hide. As such, certain inherent feline behaviors come out, notably the innate desire to hunt, pounce, and kill the prey in question. The fact that it 's merely a projection doesn 't matter very much because your cat is operating on auto-pilot, not on intellect.</p><h2>How Cats See Lasers</h2><p>There 's another factor at play here too when your cat chases a laser, and that 's the fact that it simply appealing. To understand why, it helps to have a base understanding of how your cats ' eyes operate and how they differ from human eyes.</p><p>The retina is one of the main structures of the eye. It is composed of two key types of cells: rods and cones. Rods deal with low light vision and detecting movement, while cones help the eye see color. Human eyes have more cones than rods, which means we see the world with a lot of vibrancy. Cats, on the other hand, have more rods than cones, making them experts at picking up even the slightest of movements.</p><p>What does this have to do with lasers? It means that they 're pretty hard to ignore. The moment you turn a laser point on your cat is going to pick it up in its peripheral vision, and if it hasn 't quite figured out yet that it can 't actually eat that red dot (or if it knows it can 't but doesn 't care) then that 's all it will take to start its predatory cycle.</p><h2>The Debate Over Cats and Lasers</h2><p>It might be surprising to hear that there 's some controversy over whether it 's a good idea to tempt your cat with lasers, but the cat-laser debate is one that has been going on for some time.</p><p>The main problem noted by cat enthusiasts who are anti-laser is that having your cat chase a laser is a form of teasing. Remember, your cat is stalking and pouncing on that red dot because its brain is telling it to catch the food and kill it. The cat 's not doing it distinctly as a form of play, even if it 's having fun.</p><p>The laser is an unattainable target, and no matter how great your cat 's hunting skills are it 's never going to get to eat it and it 's never going to finish out its predatory cycle. Many cats figure out the ruse and stop interacting with the laser. Others find it immensely frustrating and may start behaving badly as a result. Frustrated cats act out in less than ideal ways, such as by becoming destructive or aggressive. If you notice a connection between playing with your cat and a laser and bad behavior, it 's probably time to put the pointer away for good.</p><p>To help make laser pointers more of a game and less of a tease, give your cat a treat or a physical toy right when you're finished playing. That way it 'll get the satisfaction of a kill,even if it 's not of the laser itself.</p><h2>Laser Pointer Safety Tips</h2><p>Provided that your cat seems to actually enjoy chasing a laser and isn 't just caught in an endless loop of hunt-pounce-disappointment, there 's probably nothing to be worried about. Chasing a laser is a fantastic way for your cat to get some physical and mental exercise, and also lets it tap into its kitty instincts for a bit-something that indoor cats don 't get to do quite as often as they might like to.</p><p>Of course, you should still make sure to follow proper safety tips to avoid harming your cat during play. Here are two big ones to note.</p><p>Don 't shine the light directly in your cat 's eyes. Even toy lasers emit an incredibly bright light, so you mustn't shine it directly at your cat (or yourself!). If you do, you could cause vision problems and/or eye injuries.</p><p>Provide your cat with plenty of other toys. If the laser is your cat 's only outlet for play, it 's more likely that frustration will start to build up. Make sure that it has access to a lot of other objects for hunting and playing with, including catnip toys and wands.</p>",875
8,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-cats-like-catnip-5180869,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>Why Do Cats Like Catnip?</h1>,"<h1>Why Do Cats Like Catnip?</h1><p>Peruse any pet store or boutique shop and you will probably find a selection of catnip toys for cats. Catnip can make your cat act like a kitten again, or it may even soothe them into a state of relaxation. What is catnip, though, and why do some cats react to it so drastically?</p><h2>What Is Catnip?</h2><p>The plant, more commonly known as catnip, belongs to the plant family. This family also includes herbs such as rosemary, oregano, basil, and sage. This family of plant also contains , or catmint, which can also attract cats. Catnip can be found wild in Europe, Asia, and North America. Besides attracting cats, it has been shown to be an effective mosquito repellent. The leaves, stems, and flowers of catnip produce an aromatic oil that contains a compound called nepetalactone. This is the compound that your cat is reacting to when they react to catnip.</p><h2>The Allure of Catnip</h2><p>Cats are oftentimes attracted to catnip because of the odor the nepetalactone gives off. It is believed that nepetalactone acts as a pheromone, binding to the receptors in your cat's nose and nasal passages.</p><p>Most cats, but not all, will noticeably react to catnip. Some cats may get aggressively playful, agitated, and excited, while others may become calm and relaxed. The effects of catnip can last anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes. Once the effects have worn off, it might be a few hours before your cat reacts to catnip again. Some folks describe a cat's reaction as a catnip high, but there's no research to say whether catnip is effecting cats on a neurochemical level the same way mind-altering drugs would in people.</p><p>Despite the popularity of catnip cat toys, not all cats will react to catnip. In fact, as much has half of cats won't react to catnip at all!</p><p>Whether your cat will react to catnip is actually based on their genetics. There is a gene that can determine whether your cat will react to it, and this gene is inherited. If your cat doesn't react to catnip they may react to other plants, such as silver vine.</p><p>Silver vine, sometimes known as matatabi, belongs to the plant family and can be found in the mountains of Japan as well as China. Cats that react to catnip will also react to silver vine because it contains nepelactone too, but it also contains an aromatic compound called actinidine. Actinidine is also a cat attractant, and most cats that don't react to nepetalactone will react to actinidine. Silver vine can be found either in powder form or as chew sticks, which are essentially cuttings from the plant itself.</p><h2>How to Give Catnip</h2><p>Catnip can be purchased in a few different forms. Dried catnip can be bought in tubs, and there are sprays containing the nepelactone oil. You can even grow catnip in your yard! Keeping a tub of dried catnip around can refresh your cat's toys and can also aid in toy rotation.</p><p>Toy rotation is something that you can do to help create a mentally enriching home environment. Instead of leaving all of your cat's toys out all of the time, keep a portion of them in a plastic storage container sprinkled with dried catnip. Once a week, give the container a shake and rotate new toys in as you pick up old toys from around your house.</p><p>Dried catnip tends to work better to refresh toys than sprays, as the sprays tend to have less nepetalactone in them. The oils in dried catnip can still dissipate over time, though. Store any unused dried catnip in the freezer to extend its shelf life.</p><p>Dried catnip can also be sprinkled on top of new beds and scratching posts/toys. This can encourage your cat to their new toys and beds, instead of scratching up your furniture.</p><h2>Safety Tips</h2><p>Catnip is incredibly safe for cats. Even if your cat gets into a large amount of it, it's considered non-toxic. Of course, that doesn't mean there aren't any concerns with catnip toys. Depending on your cat's reaction, they may chew their catnip toys apart, pulling out stuffing in attempts to eat any dried catnip inside the toy. If your cat were to ingest any stuffing or fabric material from their catnip toy, they can get an intestinal foreign body or blockage that may require surgery. Cats that react aggressively to catnip may also be more likely to accidentally scratch or bite you in their play. These actions aren't meant to be harmful, but they can cause more damage than a play swat or a love bite. If your cat tends to get overly excited about catnip, use caution when giving them catnip.</p>",774
9,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-cats-show-love-553978,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training,<h1>How Cats Show They Love You</h1>,"<h1>How Cats Show They Love You</h1><p>The ways that cats show love differ from the ways humans do. Cats show love and affection by purring, bunting, and rolling over onto their back. In the cat world, there are many ways to express oneself, including these 12 displays of love.</p><h2>Purring</h2><p>The most obvious and common way cats show their happiness and love is through purring. Cats seem to have a special little motor inside them that get started when they are relaxed and enjoying something. You 'll often hear this rumbling, vibrating noise while you are petting your cat. Purrs can also mean your cat is upset but it's not as common.</p><h2>Rolling</h2><p>Children tend to throw themselves on the ground and roll around during a tantrum, but when your cat does it, it means they are excited to see you. Cats may walk or run up to you and throw themselves on the ground and begin to roll around. This is a loving greeting and means they want your attention, especially if they show you their belly.</p><h2>Bunting</h2><p>Bunting is when your cat rubs their cheeks on you or an object, head-butts you with their forehead, or rubs their head on you. It's a way for your cat to leave his scent on you, marking their territory. Cats do this when they love something or someone. They may practice bunting on other pets or their favorite humans.</p><h2>Scratching</h2><p>Scratching leaves both scented and visual marks of ownership to a cat. Pay attention to where your cat scratches the most. The areas most important to a cat are often associated with the owner.</p><h2>Kneading</h2><p>Kneading behaviors hearken back to kittenhood. Kitten paws knead against the mother cat 's breasts to induce milk to be released. Adult cats continue this behavior when they 're feeling most relaxed, content, and loved. That 's often when they're being petted on their owner 's lap. Think of kneading as a distinct expression of adoration.</p><h2>Hunting and Gifting Prey</h2><p>Cats are adorable but they're still tiny carnivores who have hunting instincts. Cats may catch everything from toys to mice and they often share their bounty with those they love. Cats who present you with a catch deserve praise. They wouldn 't bring these special gifts if they didn 't love you.</p><h2>Playing</h2><p>Kittens play out of pure enjoyment and their most favorite playmate is typically a trusted and loved companion. Some cats may actually control the interaction by moving just out of reach so you are forced to come to them and start playing.</p><h2>Sleeping</h2><p>Cats typically sleep up to 16 hours a day. Since they are the most vulnerable while sleeping, the place your cat chooses to snooze must be a secure and trusted location. There is no greater loving compliment than a cat picking your lap as their favorite sleep spot.</p><h2>Loving Eyes</h2><p>A kitty 's eyes are proportionately huge. As such, cat eyes are important assets for survival, yet extremely vulnerable. Cats that place their faces and wide-open eyes near a person are expressing great trust and love. A slow eye blinkfrom across the room is considered a cat kiss.</p><h2>Tail Posture</h2><p>If you've ever petted a cat, you've probably encountered the elevator buttpose which invites you to pay particular attention to the base of the tail. Cats love to have this body area scratched. They also use their upright tails to signal their love. When a cat approaches you with their tail held straight up and the end slightly tipped over, it's a sign of love. A cat that holds their rear end up in your face is also showing a sign of affection. Kittens greet their mother with tails flagged high in respect and adult cats continue this behavior with their favorite people.</p><h2>Meowing</h2><p>Cats rarely meow at other cats. Typically, only kittens meow to their mothers and they grow out of the habit as adults. Your adult cat uses these vocalizations specifically to interact with people. Just like us, cats don't ""talk"" to people they dislike, so even when your cat pesters you with lots of meows, remember that they are interacting with you out of love.</p><h2>Licking</h2><p>Cats spend an enormous amount of time self-grooming and friendly cats also groom each other. Cats that groom their favorite people, by licking their skin or hair or even nibbling or sucking on their clothing, indicate great affection. This spreads a familiar scent and helps mark their person as an important part of the family group.</p>",732
10,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-pooping-outside-box-554017,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Pooping Outside the Litter Box</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Pooping Outside the Litter Box</h1><h2>Your cat may have an underlying health condition</h2><p>Waking up or coming home from work to find that your cat has pooped on the floor, rather than in its litter box, is undeniably upsetting. There are several reasons why a cat might stop using its litter box, but generally, it comes down to two basic causes: The cat has a health problem, or it's a behavioral issue.</p><p>Constipated cats or cats with urinary tract infections might not be able to control the urge to defecate and end up pooping on the floor. Older cats with arthritis might have pain and difficulty in climbing into the box, and so relieve themselves on the floor next to it instead.</p><p>However, most often, it's a behavioral issue. A dirty litter box is one of the most common reasons why a cat will poop or urinate on the floor, along with a change to a new brand of litter with a smell or texture that the cat dislikes.</p><p>Changes in the home, such as a new pet or baby, a move to a new location, or a sudden change in family routine can also cause a cat to refuse to use its litter box, instead, showing its stress by defecating on the floor.</p><p>Below, we answer why cats are prompted to poop outside their litter boxes and how to stop your cat from defecating inappropriately in the future.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Poop Outside the Litter Box?</h2><p>Most often, litter box problems are caused by a change in the cat's routine or issues with its litter box. But if your house-trained cat suddenly stops using its box, your first step is to take your kitty to the vet to rule out any health issues.</p><h2>Health Problems</h2><p>Sometimes if your cat has diarrhea or constipation, the urge to go may be sudden and overwhelming, and it may not make it to the litter box in time. This situation should be temporary, however, provided your kitty has no underlying health conditions.</p><p>If your vet determines that the issue doesn't have a physiological basis, she'll probably move on to exploring whether your cat has a behavioral problem.</p><h2>Stress and Behavioral Issues</h2><p>A sudden change in your kitty's bathroom behavior may be attributed to several different possible causes, many of which boil down to feline stress.</p><p>Smelly Litter Box: It's very common for cats to turn up their noses at a litter box if it doesn't meet their exacting standards for cleanliness and odor. If it's not pristine, even cats that have been litter trained for years may reject the box in favor of another area (usually one that will get your attention).</p><p>Wrong Box Location: Is the location of the litter box problematic for your cat? If it's near a door or in a part of the house that gets a lot of traffic or that the cat can't easily get to, consider moving it. This isn't recommended if your cat has dementia as it may create more confusion.</p><p>Change in Household: If another cat or animal or even a new baby has been introduced to the household or if someone has moved in, moved out, or moved on, your cat may simply be marking its territory. This should be temporary until the cat gets used to the new situation. But be aware that any change to a cat's routine or environment can cause stress, which may result in out-of-the-ordinary behavior.</p><p>Recently Adopted Kitty: A cat that's been recently adopted may take a few weeks or months to fully adjust and feel comfortable enough to reveal its personality. It may be that your adoptive cat was feeling a bit uncertain at first and was willing to share the litter box but later changed its mind.</p><h2>How to Stop Your Cat From Defecating Outside Its Litter Box</h2><p>In the absence of health issues, take steps to prevent your cat from doing its dirty deeds someplace besides its litter box.</p><h2>Clean the Box</h2><p>First and foremost, scoop clumps from the litter box daily and deep clean it frequently. This means jettisoning the old litter, scrubbing the empty box with mild dish soap and warm water, rinsing it with clean water, letting it air-dry, and pouring in a fresh supply of clean, unscented litter (sometimes scented litter is unappealing to finicky cats). Whenever you handle your kitty's litter box, always use rubber gloves and a face mask to protect yourself from microscopic bugs and litter dust.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If you're pregnant, leave all litter box maintenance to another member of the household to reduce your risk of contracting toxoplasmosis.</p><h2>Focus on Location</h2><p>If you find that your cat is drawn to using a particular spot, such as a bath mat, as its latrine, try to block its access to the room by setting up a baby gate or closing/locking the door whenever possible. At the same time, encourage your pet to use its litter box as intended by locating the box well away from its food and water bowls in a quiet, private area that's easy to get to.</p><h2>Add Another Litter Box</h2><p>If you've added a second cat, consider installing additional litter boxes rather than trying to make both cats share a box. The optimal number of litter boxes is one for each cat plus one more. This means that if you have two cats, you should provide three litter boxes. Note that the boxes need to be in totally different places. Otherwise, one cat may attempt to ""guard"" and own all the toilets and keep the other cat away.</p><h2>Put Up Obstacles</h2><p>If there's a particular area where your cat has been going frequently and you can't block its access, try laying down aluminum foil or spray the area with a kitty-safe deterrent. The goal is to make the inappropriate area as undesirable to the cat as possible.</p><h2>Re-Create the Scene of the Crime</h2><p>Take a look at the surface where your cat prefers to defecate and try duplicating that surface in the litter box. For instance, if your kitty likes tile, leave the bottom of the litter box bare. If it targets paper, line the bottom of the box with paper; if it goes on carpeting, install a carpet remnant in its box.</p>",1024
11,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ways-to-help-cat-with-new-space-2436403,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>How to Move With a Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Move With a Cat</h1><h2>Tips for Before, During, and After Moving</h2><p>Moving to a new home is stressful for humans and pets alike. Most cats are sensitive creatures that dislike change, so moving is one of the most stressful events they can experience. Stress can have a negative impact on your cat's health and behavior. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce your cat's stress before, during, and after your move.</p><h2>Before the Move</h2><p>Your cat will notice changes as you prepare to move and may become stressed before you even finish packing. This can cause the cat to hide, escape, or run away. Make sure your cat is confined indoors for a week or two before you move, even if he normally has access to go outside. Consider keeping your cat indoors permanently for safety.</p><p>Try to stick to your normal routine as best as possible. Feed your cat at the usual times. Keep your cat's things in their usual places right up until the move, including litter boxes, bowls, and scratching pads.</p><p>If your cat loves boxes the way most cats do, then you can make this process fun by leaving empty boxes around for your cat to play in while you pack.</p><p>Your cat will likely need to travel in a carrier during the move, so take this time to help your cat get used to the carrier. Keep it open in an area where your cat spends time. Put a soft bed inside and add catnip or treats. Your cat may be less stressed during the trip if he has developed a positive association with the carrier.</p><p>Spend extra time playing and bonding with your cat. This can help your cat feel confident and calm going into moving day.</p><h2>During the Move</h2><p>Confine your cat to a room of the house while boxes and furniture are being moved. The room should contain a litter box, cat bed, food/water bowls, toys, and a scratching pad. Remove any items to be moved before your cat goes into the room. When you are ready to leave for your new home, you can pack up your cat's items together for easy setup in the new home.</p><p>Your cat will need to be restrained during the trip, most likely in a carrier. If your cat is used to a leash and harness and tolerates car rides, you may be able to restrain him with a pet car seat and seat belt. However, a cat should not be loose in the car for the safety of everyone. The cat may become lodged under a seat or hide under the brake or gas pedal.</p><p>A calming aid may be beneficial to help your cat relax during the trip, especially if you have a long drive or a cat that gets very stressed in the car. Ask your veterinarian about calming aids for cats. Many natural calming supplements are available over-the-counter. Your vet may recommend a prescription sedative for an especially anxious cat or a long-distance trip.</p><h2>After the Move</h2><p>Bring the carrier into the closed room and open it up. Allow your cat to come out on his own; do not forcibly remove him from the carrier. Remain in the room while he sniffs and explores. Some cats will be eager to explore, while others will remain in the carrier or hide elsewhere in the room.</p><p>Feline calming pheromones like Feliway can help your cat adjust to the new environment. Place a pheromone diffuser in the room or spray bedding with pheromones. The pheromones send calming signals to cats and can help reduce stress.</p><p>Keep your cat in the safe room while moving in, unpacking, and organizing the home. Check on your cat periodically, spending time to play and bond so your cat becomes acclimated. Try to stick to the normal feeding schedule as best as possible.</p><p>Your cat may not eat as much as usual right after the move. You can entice him to eat by feeding him warm, moist cat food and treats. Contact your veterinarian if your cat refuses to eat for two days.</p><h2>Adjusting to the New Home</h2><p>Once your cat is eating and seems calm, you can let him begin to explore other areas of the home. Your cat may even seem curious about what lies on the other side of the door. Gradually allow your cat to discover his new home. If possible, introduce one room additional room at a time and block off areas where you don't want your cat to hide. A frightened cat may take off and hide somewhere like a basement or attic.</p><p>If your cat runs and hides, let him stay hidden (as long as it's a safe place). Every cat adjusts at a different pace. Of course, a brave cat may be ready to have the run of the house. Some cats will insist on getting out of the safe room while others prefer to stay.</p><p>Be patient with your cat. Even the bravest of cats will experience stress after moving to a new home. However, you may need professional help if your cat is still tightly stressed after a few weeks. Ask your veterinarian for behavior advice or seek out a feline behaviorist.</p><p>If you plan to allow your cat to go outdoors at the new property, first make sure there aren't any poisonous plants in the backyard. Get your cat an updated tag and make sure any microchip registration has your current contact information. Keep your cat indoors for the first two weeks or longer. Once your cat seems fully adjusted to the inside of the new home, you can introduce your yard to your cat. Begin by taking your at outdoors for about ten minutes of supervised exploration. Gradually increase the time outdoors until your cat seems confident with the area.</p>",952
12,https://www.thesprucepets.com/building-confidence-in-fearful-cats-555505,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>Training Your Fearful Cat to Be Confident</h1>,"<h1>Training Your Fearful Cat to Be Confident</h1><p>Working with fearful cats can be a challenge because people often confuse their behavior with aggression. Does your cat hiss at strangers? Dive under the bed when the doorbell rings? Attack other pets or humans? While a normal dose of caution keeps cats out of danger, extreme fear makes cats miserable and disrupts a happy home. Fortunately, there are things you can do to calm your cat's fears, though it will take time and patience.</p><h2>Create a Calming Environment</h2><p>Cats are observers and very cautious by nature. They take their time getting to know everything and everyone before they are comfortable enough to explore and socialize. With timid or fearful cats, it's best to let them work this out on their own, but there are ways you can encourage it.</p><p>Provide your cat with high perches and calm places where they feel safe and can get away when needed. Make it inviting with things like catnip or feline pheromone spray and diffusers, which do wonders for calming down cats.</p><p>It's tempting to be very cautious around fearful cats but that's not the best approach. You want your cat to get used to your home as it normally is, so walking on eggshells because you don't want to upset kitty is not going to work. Act normal, but try to keep the home as calm as possible. Don't lose your temper around your cat or yell at it, and do your best to avoid startling noises. A relaxed environment is one that both you and the cat can benefit from.</p><p>If you have multiple cats in your home, keep in mind that fearful cats can also be targeted by other cats. Felines that act like a victim may as well wear a kick mesign. The other cats obligingly turn the shrinking violet kitty into a punching bag. If a scared cat can 't get away from a perceived threat, it will use aggression to defend itself.</p><h2>Designate a Kitty Room</h2><p>Sometimes having a full house to explore is too much for a cat, so you may need to temporarily narrow your cat's range. Remember that cats are territorial, so having a big space to ""oversee"" can be overwhelming.</p><p>Creating a room just for your cat can be a good approach. It creates a home within a home and has all the comforts kitty needs, including food, litter, a bed, and toys. This can become a safe haven in any spare room that doesn't get a lot of normal traffic. It's not off-limits to people, of course, but can offer comfort to your cat.</p><p>At first, you can keep the door closed until kitty adapts to its surroundings. After a while, open the door and let it explore the rest of the house at its own pace. This may be at night when everyone's asleep and that's OK. You can also leave a bowl of treats in another room to encourage your cat to explore more often and close off potential hiding spots.</p><h2>Take It Easy</h2><p>Encouraging timid cats to break their cycle of fear takes time. Be very patient and don't force your cat to do anything. That means you shouldn't poke your head under the bed or carry and place it anywhere in the house against its will. This will only reinforce the scared behavior.</p><p>Let the cat come to you. You can encourage interaction by speaking softly and offering positive experiences, but don't push it. If there's a person in the home who the cat is particularly uncomfortable with, have them feed the cat. With time, the cat will learn that people are not a threat.</p><h2>Offer Positive Experiences</h2><p>Just like dogs, cats do best when offered positive experiences. Offer your cat treats and toys to soften their fear. Encourage interaction with toys cats can't resist but give it space. A long feather wand is perfect because the cat can play with you while keeping what it perceives as a safe distance.</p><p>If your cat is very timid, place treats near your cat and step away. Over time, slowly move closer or stay longer each time you do this and talk in your soft, encouraging tone. If you're patient, you can work it up to taking a treat out of your hand.</p><p>For cats who are scared in specific situations, such as when a stranger enters the house, concentrate on overcoming that fear in particular. Whenever someone comes over, give your cat a treat so they know it's OK for that person to be there. These situations will take more time and you might be able to enlist the help of understanding friends or family members who come by regularly.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>While a hiding cat may not bother you, constant anxiety increases the stress that can make cats sick. For instance, stress can aggravate bladder inflammation (cystitis), which in turn prompts hit-or-miss bathroom behaviors. Even when the bladder doesn 't hurt, anxious cats use potty deposits or will increase scratching behavior as a way to calm themselves-sort of the way nervous humans bite their fingernails.</p><p>For these reasons, you might need to seek the help of your veterinarian or a cat behaviorist if you have patiently tried the other methods without success. There are medications available which your vet may prescribe, but they aren't magic and won 't turn your terrified tabby into a social butterfly. However, they can help get your cat in the right frame of mind to learn, by helping to normalize brain chemistry gone haywire.</p><p>Pilling cats, especially fearful felines, can make their anxiety worse and leave you a bloody mess. Most drugs can be compounded into tasty treats, or turned into salves you can smear on the cat 's ear to be absorbed through the skin. Some medications may take several days or weeks before you 'll notice any improvement, so be patient.</p><p>Drug therapy generally isn 't used forever and it can have side effects. These solutions work best when paired with behavior modification, counter conditioning, and desensitization techniques that teach the cat better ways to deal with its fears. This is where a veterinarian behaviorist can be of tremendous help.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is to avoid pushing your scared cat into situations it finds uncomfortable, which means there's no good way to actively proof the behavior. Allowing the cat to be wary and overcome fears on its own is the best way. Over time, it's likely that the cat will have more confidence when exposed to new experiences in the future.</p>",1080
13,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-discourage-bad-behavior-551821,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>How to Discipline Your Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Discipline Your Cat</h1><p>It is possible to discipline a cat for harmful or destructive behavior. Cats are frequently known to jump on the counters, chew on wires, and scratch household items that are not designed to be scratched. Some of these behaviors are natural reactions to a cat 's environment, while others are simply bad habits.</p><p>Allowing a cat to behave badly without consequences reinforces the idea that the behavior is acceptable. Fortunately, it's possible to change a cat's behavior by rewarding for good behavior and disciplining for bad behavior. However, because you don't want to damage your relationship to the cat or hurt it, it's important to know the right way to discipline a cat.</p><h2>Train Your Cat</h2><p>Cats are smarter than many people think and they have a great memory. Experts state that cats have both long-term and short-term memory so they are trainable. At the same time, it also means they know what they can get away with repeatedly.</p><p>Pets, like people, react well to positive reinforcement, so cats will remember when they get something they enjoy. Most cats like attention, food, toys, or all three. Choose a motivator that you can use to entice your cat to do what you want it to do and to provide it with a form of positive reinforcement. If possible, reward your cat with this special item only when training for this particular behavior. By reserving the desirable item for training, it will add to the value of the reward and make it that much more enticing to your cat.</p><p>If you are struggling to find an item that your cat is motivated by, consider things like tuna, canned spray cheese, shrimp, and catnip toys. These may be items that your cat has never experienced before, so they may help in getting your cat 's attention.</p><p>Kailey Whitman</p><h2>Discourage Bad Behavior</h2><p>Disciplining your cat personally is not a good idea. It does nothing but teach your cat to be afraid of you and does not deter the bad behavior when you are not present. However, there are some ways to prevent behavior even if you aren't around.</p><p>It's not recommended to use spray bottles or noisy cans to punish or deter your cat. Your cat will only start to be wary of you when you are around and will continue the bad behavior when you aren't around. The only effective thing you have taught your cat is to be scared of you. This is obviously not want you want!</p><p>To have a spray or other deterrent be effective, it has to be deployed every single time the cat performs the behavior. This is why double sided tape or the motion-sensor air sprays are more effective. First, your cat associates the negative with the counter or object, not you, and, second, it is present all the time, even if you are not there. The other thing to avoid doing is rewarding the bad behavior with attention. Ignoring your cat or redirecting them to a toy is better than picking them up, talking to them, or petting them when they are performing and undesirable behavior.</p><p>Provide alternatives so that your cat has an outlet for the behavior it is trying to express. For example, if your cat ""counter surfs"" it may want to be up high. Provide a perch or a window sill bed that is about the same height as the counter, then reward your cat it when it uses the perch. Or, if your cat jumps to the faucet every time it turns on, it may just want some running water to drink from, so consider getting a fountain.</p><p>Certain pheromones can be sprayed on an object or diffused into the area that you do not want your cat to scratch. These pheromones (like Feliway) signal to your cat that they have already ""marked"" the area and do not need to mark it again. Cats often mark territory by scratching. Obviously, providing a scratching post for them and placing treats or other rewards around the post will help deflect unwanted scratching as well.</p><p>The most important thing to remember is to never physically punish your cat. This includes spanking, hitting, kicking, or hurting your cat intentionally. Attempting to teach a cat a lesson through physical means does not work and can actually lead to more disruptive, even aggressive, behavior.</p><p>Do not scruff your cat. This is no longer recommended as a method of restraint or transport for adult cats. Scruffing is painful and when you cause a misbehaving cat pain, it will only further exacerbate an issue. It is also thought that what appeared to be relaxation for some cats who are scruffed is actually fear paralysis.</p><p>An alternative to grabbing a cat by the scruff is putting a blanket over it and scooping the cat up inside it. This will keep you and the cat safe and allow you to transport the cat without stressing it out further.</p><h2>Encourage and Train Good Behavior</h2><p>Believe it or not, techniques used to train dogs, such as positive reinforcement clicker training, also work well in cats! Rewarding positive behavior with treats, pets, or play gives your cat the good vibes it needs to continue to exhibit this behavior and it strengthens the positive bond you have with your cat. Whenever possible, give treats, praise, and attention to your cat if it is behaving nicely. If you notice it lying next to something it used to chew, reward it. If you notice it scratching the scratching pole instead of your sofa, reward it. Your cat will quickly learn the difference between good and bad behavior.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>It is important that you never physically hurt your cat.

14,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aggression-between-family-cats-551794,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>How to Solve Aggression Between Household Cats</h1>,"<h1>How to Solve Aggression Between Household Cats</h1><p>While it can be upsetting and frustrating, fighting between cats that live in the same household is a problem that in many cases can be prevented and resolved with the help of a cat behavior professional and veterinarian. Cat behavior is complex and there are a variety of reasons why aggression can occur.</p><h2>Why Do Household Cats Get Aggressive?</h2><p>Aggression is not a diagnosis; it is part of normal feline behavior and is strongly influenced by early social history and exposure to humans and other animals, gender, social context, handling, personality, and many other variables. Aggression between cohabitating cats can come in several forms with different causes. Fear, anxiety, medical issues, the inappropriate introduction of a new cat, and lack of resources all can contribute to inter-cat aggression within a household.</p><h2>Lack of Socialization</h2><p>Socialization is the process of preparing a cat to enjoy interactions and be comfortable with other animals, people, places and activities. Ideally, socialization should begin during the ""sensitive period"" which is between 2 and 7 weeks of age for kittens.</p><p>Many cats do not receive adequate socialization and due to this, problems are more likely to arise when one or more adults that have not been socialized to their own species are involved. Because these cats lack appropriate experiences, they do not understand normal feline communication and etiquette and are likely to have intense and inappropriate responses to the sight of another cat. They may run away and hide in fear, or they may attack in an attempt to drive the other cat away from their personal space.</p><p>During adequate socialization, the animal should develop appropriate social behavior towards their own species and those others with which they have been appropriately socialized. This will positively influence social behavior expressed later in life.</p><h2>Introducing a New Cat</h2><p>Properly introducing your new cat with your existing cats is essential, as introductions often lay the groundwork for their relationship. If your current cat has lived with other cats and was always friendly it can be very tempting to just let your new cat out in the same space as your current cat. You may assume they will just work it out; however, cats don 't always hit it off the right way and a negative initial meeting can set a poor foundation for their relationship.</p><p>Cat-to-cat introductions should be done slowly, and with the needs of each cat kept in mind. It is difficult to resist the urge to have the cats meet immediately so they can begin a wonderful friendship; however, if you let your new cat loose in the home a number of things can happen with less than stellar consequences.</p><p>Your existing cat may feel that their territory has been invaded if the newcomer is just let loose to explore. This could lead to your established cat feeling unsafe in their home and in turn that leads to behavior changes or it could be aggressive (offensive) towards the new cat. That does not help either of them!</p><p>From the new cat 's perspective, it is unsure of where it is. Every scent and sound is unfamiliar and a possible threat lurks around every corner. If you have adopted your new cat, it has likely experienced a controlled number of sounds and smells. It may also be used to living in a small space and while you want it to experience &lsquo;freedom ', rushing it can leave it feeling very overwhelmed and stressed.</p><h2>Competition for Resources</h2><p>In multi-cat households, it is not uncommon for one or more cats to prevent access to important resources, such as food, water, and litter boxes. It is important to provide multiple and separated key environmental resources which include litter boxes, water, food, hiding spaces, places to perch, resting/sleeping areas, play areas, scratching areas, and toys. This helps to decrease social tension and competition, decreases territorial motivations, decreases stress and fear, and provides choices that all help to prevent aggression between cats.</p><p>The last thing cats want to do is fight. Instead, cats prefer to flee or avoid each other, as fighting can result in an injury. But if these options are not available, aggression is the last option. In multi-cat households, the cats are often not related, yet have to share their resources and have limited opportunity to hide or avoid situations of potential conflict.</p><h2>Medical Issues</h2><p>If you notice your cat has sudden changes in their behavior towards another cat in the home, your cat should be examined and have diagnostics to rule out underlying medical issues. Cats in pain can also uncharacteristically have episodes of aggression. A cat may begin to growl or hiss when other pets in the household approach them and have overall increased irritability. Other medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism, dental disease, osteoarthritis, and cognitive dysfunction can also cause increased irritability and aggression between cats.</p><h2>Lack of Predatory Outlets</h2><p>Cats have natural behaviors and needs, and they must have opportunities to express those behaviors. It 's important to provide your cat with predatory outlets which include a variety of toys, scheduled playtimes with cats separately once to twice daily, and puzzle food toys.</p><h2>How to Treat Aggression Between Cats</h2><p>Aggression refers to a wide variety of complex behaviors that occur for different reasons under various circumstances. Early intervention is best-contact your veterinarian and credentialed cat behavior professional to help as soon as you notice tension and/or aggression between cats.</p>",889
15,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-scruff-a-cat-554075,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>What Is Scruffing in Cats?</h1>,"<h1>What Is Scruffing in Cats?</h1><p>Cats are only grabbed by the scruff on their neck in limited circumstances, and none of these situations are helpful to mimic in a home, veterinary or shelter setting, yet some people recommend to scruff your cat to discourage bad behavior. We all want what is best for our cats, and there are more effective and kind ways to correct behavior in our feline friends. Find out why it is not recommended for you to scruff your cat to discourage bad behavior.</p><h2>What Is Scruffing?</h2><p>Scruffing is a general term for a variety of holds on the skin of a cat 's neck. Grasping the scruff of the neck varies from a gentle squeeze of skin to grasping a larger fold of skin with varying amounts of pressure, and sometimes is accompanied by lifting the cat up or heavily restraining the cat in other ways.</p><h2>Why and When Are Cats Scruffed?</h2><p>As Kittens: Kittens go limp due to a flexor reflex. This reflex is only present during the first few weeks of the kitten's life. Mother cats grab kittens by their scruff only in the first few weeks of life to transport them. They do not do this to discipline them, which is a common myth. It's important to remember that we, as humans, are not cats. A mother cat knows the precise pressure to place on the skin at the back of the neck and cats have pressure sensors on their teeth, which explains why they have the ability to carry a mouse in their mouths without making a scratch.</p><p>Attacked by a Predator: When cats get grabbed by predators, a large bird of prey, for example, they are commonly grabbed by the scruff of their necks.</p><p>Mating: During mating, the male cat will mount the female from her rear, holding her by the scruff of her neck with his teeth. This is believed to immobilize the female and provide proper orientation for mounting as well as be a defensive move on the males part because female cats often attack males during mating. Male cats' genitals are covered with small keratinized spines that serve the purpose of stimulating ovulation of females which can be painful for the female cats hence why female cats can often attack the male cat during mating.</p><p>Cats are only grabbed by the scruff on their neck in limited circumstances: During the first few weeks of life by their mother, during mating, fighting, and when they are being attacked by a predator. None of these situations are helpful to mimic in a home, veterinary or shelter setting.</p><h2>Using Scruffing to Discourage Bad Behavior</h2><p>It is a common myth to use scruffing to discourage bad behavior in your cats. As stated above, mother cats do not scruff kittens to punish them, and it causes fear and stress. When training your cat, using fear and punishment is not recommended for a variety of reasons.</p><p>Can increase fear anxiety, and stress: There is always a reason for behavior. Cats are not spiteful when they display undesirable behaviors, and commonly, they are natural behaviors for the cat. Punishing your cat can increase anxiety and cause cats to feel insecure. Not feeling safe in your own environment and stress is often a cause for the unwanted behaviors.</p><p>Can damage your relationship with your cat: When cats are doing things we do not want, we can react in a way that startles our cats. This includes shouting, scruffing, throwing things, and spraying water. These methods can cause your cat to become scared and anxious around you, lose their trust in you, associate the punishment with you and not the behavior, and increase behavior issues due to increase fear and anxiety.</p><p>Can result in aggression: One of the most common reasons cats exhibit aggressive behavior towards humans is due to fear. If you were scared and someone grabbed you, many of us would instinctually resort to aggressive behavior, pushing the person away or punching them, this is true of animals too.</p><p>Does not teach the cat the wanted behavior and does not effectively communicate with your cat what you do want: Punishment may stop your cat from doing whatever they are doing at that moment, but it does not teach the cat what you want. Often, cats will not know what they are being punished for, will learn to engage in the unwanted behavior when you are not around, or increase the already-present behavior since it is very difficult for punishment to be effective. In order for punishment to be effective, the punishment must be administered within a second or two of the unwanted behavior, must occur every time the behavior occurs, and must be aversive enough to stop the cat from repeating the behavior in the future but not so aversive as to frighten the cat.</p><p>The best way to discourage your cat 's bad behavior is to find out why they are doing it and then offer a better solution. Often when cats are exhibiting unwanted behaviors like destructive scratching or going outside the litter box, they are telling us that something is not right and as their caregivers, we need to listen. This can be due to medical issues, stressors in their environment, them not feeling safe, not enough resources, and more.</p>",873
16,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-leash-train-cats-551823,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>How to Train Your Cat to Walk on a Leash</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Cat to Walk on a Leash</h1><p>Despite popular belief, cats can be trained to do things that dogs often do. Some cats even enjoy doing activities like walking on a leash. Just like a puppy that has never been leash-trained though, a cat that is put on a leash will not know what to do unless you train it to walk on it first.</p><h2>Choosing a Collar or Harness for Leash Training Your Cat</h2><p>Collars are good for cats for identification purposes and to hang a bell on, but not great to use with a leash. Additionally, any collar placed on a cat should be easy release which is another reason not to use a leash with a collar on a cat. Cats are built differently than dogs and they can easily slip out of a collar that is attached to a leash. Harnesses are much more secure for walking a cat with, especially when you are first training it.</p><p>Choose a harness that fits securely and is snug but not too tight on your cat. You can check to make sure it isn 't too tight by sliding two fingers underneath the harness. If two fingers can slide between the harness and your cat, then it should fit correctly. But if you can fit more fingers or fewer fingers under the harness, it may be too loose or tight.</p><p>Harnesses that are specifically designed for cats work best. If a harness is uncomfortable, your cat will only think about how poorly it fits or how difficult it is to walk in. Harnesses that are made from a soft material, cut in a way to allow a cat to walk normally, and that are lightweight are your best options for your cat. Make sure the harness you choose also has a D-ring securely attached to the back of it as well since this is where you will attach the leash.</p><h2>Choosing a Leash for Your Cat</h2><p>Lightweight leashes that are 4 to 6 feet long are ideal for leash training cats of all sizes. Retractable leashes and leashes that are longer are okay to use once a cat is trained but stick to a manageable length and leash weight at first.</p><h2>Let Your Cat Adjust to the Harness</h2><p>Once your cat has an appropriately sized harness on, allow it to get used to it. Let your cat sniff it and give it treats while it does so.</p><p>Keep in mind that the length of time that it takes for a cat to get used to wearing a harness will vary from cat to cat. A harness may not bother your cat at all or it may take several hours or days for your cat to adjust. Be sure to praise your cat and give it treats while it has the harness on. Do not leave the harness on for more than a few minutes if your cat is frightened by it, but increase the time it spends wearing the harness each time you put it on. Work your way up to leaving the harness on for an hour. If your cat is walking around normally while wearing the harness, then you are ready to take the next step in leash training.</p><h2>Let Your Cat Adjust to the Leash</h2><p>If your cat doesn 't mind wearing the harness, go ahead and attach the leash to the D-ring. While still in the safety of your home, allow your cat to drag the leash around to get used to being attached to it. If your cat is easily spooked, you may want to instead attach the leash and hold it while still allowing your cat to move about freely. Some cats are scared of a leash dragging behind them and you wouldn 't want to cause your cat to be immediately frightened of the leash. Once your cat is used to the leash being connected to it, you can advance to the outdoors.</p><h2>Teach Your Cat to Walk on a Leash</h2><p>Continue to hold the leash and let your cat walk freely outside. Coax your cat to walk where you want it to walk using treats or toys. Don 't pull your cat by the leash, but a gentle tug to redirect its attention is okay. You should continuously praise your cat with treats if it is walking in the direction you seek.</p><p>Over time your cat will get used to the sights, sounds, smells, and experiences of the outdoors and will be safe in its harness and leash. This may take several days or weeks for some cats, while others will be more comfortable right away.</p><h2>Make Sure Your Cat Is Safe</h2><p>Cats that spend time outdoors are more likely to get fleas, ticks, heartworms, and other parasites. Discuss preventative options with your vet to make sure your cat is safe and protected while enjoying time outside.</p><p>Stay away from things that may startle your cat, such as busy roads and barking dogs, while outside. Even though a cat may be trained to walk on a leash, different situations may scare it and cause it to be afraid of going on a future walk.</p>",848
17,https://www.thesprucepets.com/crate-training-cats-553959,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>How to Crate Train Your Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Crate Train Your Cat</h1><h2>Take the stress out of car rides and vet visits</h2><p>Crate training with cats isn't as common as with dogs, but it is worth the effort. Kittens learn more easily and quickly than adult cats, but even set-in-their-ways felines can accept training to the crate.</p><p>Many cat owners say hates the crateis a top reason cats don 't visit the veterinarian as often as they should, and many felines only see the crate when it's time to be taken to the veterinarian or groomer. Your pet cat is smart. It only takes once for the feline to learn that the crate means unpleasant experiences.</p><p>Instead, train your kitten to associate the crate/carrier with fun, positive experiences. This allows you to quickly confine and safely transport the cat whenever necessary, rather than play hide-and-seek during emergencies to find the frightened feline. Happy acceptance of the crate also means less stress, and a happier, emotionally healthier cat.</p><h2>Introduce the Crate</h2><p>Start by making the crate part of the furniture. Set it on the floor in a corner of the room for your cat to explore at its leisure. If it 's out all the time, the strange or scary factor of the crate wears off. Take the door off the crate so your cat can come and go. Toss a soft blanket or towel inside for a bed, especially one that you've rubbed over your cat's body so it recognizes the scent of the area.</p><h2>Try Clicker Training</h2><p>Consider using clicker training to inspire your cat to quickly go into the crate. Review how to load the clickerand locate the training treats for spur of the moment sessions. Then wait for the opportunity when you see your cat approach, sniff, or enter the crate. Click the clicker to tell the cat that touching, going inside, or even just approaching the crate is what you want, and then reward with the treat or favorite toy. The more you practice, the better your pet cat will become at hanging out near or even inside the crate.</p><h2>Put the Door Back On</h2><p>It may take a week or more for the kitten or cat to feel comfortable around the carrier. Once that happens, put the door back on, and wait until the cat goes inside. Then shut the door while praising in a calm, happy voice. The goal is to convince your cat that this is normal and no reason for upset feelings. After a minute or so, let your cat out and give it a treat or toy reserved only for the best performance. Praise the dickens out of the cat. Your cat should know that staying calm inside the crate earns it good things.</p><h2>Build on Repetition</h2><p>Repeat training sessions at least once a day over the next two weeks, building up the time until the kitty stays inside three minutes, four, then five minutes and so on. Once your cat has reached 10 minutes and remains calm, pick up the carrier while the cat is in it and carry it around, and then let the cat out. Take the carrier out to the car (with the cat inside), sit there and talk to your cat, then bring it back into the house and release it. Don't forget to offer the treat.</p><p>Soon, you should be able to take your cat for car rides in the carrier without your feline throwing a fit. The cat will learn that most of the time the carrier means good things. The vet visit won't be the only association it has.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>Never give up on training and just transport your cat without a crate or carrier. Pets should always ride in a carrier when traveling in a car because this keeps them from distracting you while driving or being injured when you brake suddenly or are in an accident. Plus, a loose pet can escape from the car.</p><p>If your older cat has had a lot of bad associations with the crate, don't expect behavior to change overnight. A common training mistake is to rush the steps and expect immediate results. Give your cat plenty of time. You may need to pause on certain steps of the training process and stay there for a week or two. Once your cat has succeeded, then move on to the next step.</p><p>Also, be mindful of what your cat associates with the crate or carrier. If you only put it in the carrier to go to the vet, groomer, or someplace else it doesn't enjoy, it's likely your cat will not like the carrier. Try just moving the carrier from room to room without leaving the house, and going for a short drive and then returning home. Then, try getting the cat into the crate and visiting various places the cat might enjoy, such as a friend who will welcome your pet with treats.</p><p>If you continue to struggle to get your cat to accept a crate, try swapping it for a different container (for example, swap a hard carrier for a soft one, or try a bigger or smaller crate).</p>",845
18,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-communication-by-smell-553941,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>Why Cats Smell Everything</h1>,"<h1>Why Cats Smell Everything</h1><p>A cat's sense of smell defines life for your cat. We used to believe dogs relied more on scent than cats, but current research indicates felines are incredibly scent oriented. Think of your cat 's individual smell as a feline name tag. For cats, scent determines sexual status and is used to communicate, to interact socially, and to identify territory.</p><p>To put this in perspective, people average five to 20 million scent-analyzing cells lining their nose. Cats have about 67 million. (The king of scenting pets, the Bloodhound, has 300 million.) Although people haven 't the equipmentto understand cat smells, we can learn to recognize and understand behaviors prompted by scent.</p><h2>Cats' Smell and Scratching</h2><p>Cats have scent glands between their toes in the pads of their feet. When they scratch an object, that not only creates visible marks, it also leaves behind their personal scent. When cats want to signal ownership, they pointedly scratch objects in the presence of another cat (or dog) they want to impress. Even declawed cats go through the motions. Prime paw-scented targets include any real estate that has high importance, such as near doorways, litter box, sleeping areas and the like.</p><p>Since clawing serves as a communication tool for the cat, it is impossible to prevent it. The best way to deal with claws is to provide claw training and offer your new pet a legal claw target so he 'll leave your valuables alone.</p><h2>Cat Smell and Bunting</h2><p>The toes are only one place that boasts scent glands. Cats have similar scent glands in the skin of the chin, lips, cheeks, forehead, and tail. The behavior of rubbing the head and body against people, other animals, and objects is called bunting.</p><p>Bunting spreads your kitten 's signature odor upon whatever he rubs, and this sharing of the scentidentifies family members and safe objects with familiar odor. Bunting is a huge compliment when Kitty head-bumps you, or rubs your ankles and twines his tail about your leg. He 's marking you as part of his family, a favorite part of his territory or property.</p><p>Studies indicate that specific pheromones produced by cheek glands have a calming influence on cats. They 've been artificially reproduced in the Feliway products, and these pheromones identify territory as safe. Another pheromone fraction produced by the cheek glands identifies other cats as friends.</p><h2>Action Communicates, Too</h2><p>Face rubbing is thought to be a subtle sign of deference with the subordinate kitty approaching and bumping/rubbing against the more dominant pet or person. This also places vulnerable eyes within range of tooth and claw, and so head bumps and cheek rubs to your face (or another cat 's face) should be considered a sign of friendship and great trust.</p><p>Nose touches and hip leans are considered by your kitten to be gestures of friendship. You may notice Kitty cheek-rub as a greeting behavior, too, after you come home from work. He 's not only sniffing your shoes or purse to readwhere you 've been but also bunts to freshen the family scentand so welcome you home.</p><p>Social grooming-that is, cats and kittens grooming each other or even you!-is also thought to figure into this mechanism of sharing familiar scent. You 'll know your kitten considers you, the dog, or the other cats a true part of the family when he wants to clean you.</p><h2>Cat Smell and Urine Spray</h2><p>Urine contains more specialized chemicals (pheromones), which will tell other cats the sexual status of the kitty that left the urine. Male and female cats crouch to urinate and release the urine over a flat surface-the litter box. When a cat wants to use the urine to mark territory, the posture is different. The spraying cat stands erect, backs up to the target, holds the tail straight up with just the tip quivering a bit, and releases the urine backward against vertical surfaces like trees, stones, or your wall or furniture.</p><p>Urine from an intact male cat has a particularly strong odor that can be hard to eliminate when used to mark territorial boundaries inside your house. The pheromones in the urine announce to the other cats that King Tom rules this area, and the spraying helps suppress the sexual behavior of less dominant cats that venture into the territory. Intact females who spray tend to do so to announce their receptiveness to the feline Romeos in the area.</p><p>Neutering greatly reduces the incidence of territorial spraying. Altered cats of either sex, though, may resort to spraying behavior and hit or miss litter box behavior when they feel insecure. Stress can prompt Kitty to spread his own familiar, comforting scent around the room. In these instances, spraying acts as a kind of stress-buster for the bothered cat.</p>",786

A percentage of cats simply inherit the ""shy gene"" and act aggressively every time they become frightened. Poor socialization also results in fear aggression. Punishment by the owner can make it worse. Cats may develop ""stranger danger"" fear of people, places, other cats, certain noises, or even odors, and react with aggression. They can generalize one scary experience (such as a car ride to the vet) with all future car rides. A single ""bad"" episode with a longtime feline friend can turn the relationship sour and prompt inter-cat aggression.</p><h2>Recognizing Cat Fear Aggression</h2><p>In order to train your fearful cat to not be aggressive, you need to be able to recognize their triggers. Scared cats quickly learn that aggressive behavior makes the scary ""thing"" go away. Once this behavior is learned, they will use it repeatedly to ward off the trigger. Affected cats may turn from offense to defense and back again during the arousal. They display a mix of defensive body signals (ears flattened sideways, tail tucked, crouching, and leaning away) and aggressive signals (fluffed fur, showing teeth, hissing, growling, swatting, biting, and scratching). Usually, the pupils of their eyes dilate wide with no relation to the amount of light present.</p><p>If you can determine the trigger, you will have a much easier time soothing the cat and helping to eliminate the fear aggression in cats. If the cat's fear aggression is mild and you can avoid the triggers that make your kitty aggress, no other treatment may be necessary. If that's not the case and the triggers either can't be avoided or identified, you'll need to work to diffuse the fear.</p><h2>Check With a Vet</h2><p>Your first step should be to schedule a vet visit for a checkup. Sometimes aggressive behavior can indicate a medical condition in the cat, even if it doesn't seem sick. This is especially true if the cat is displaying a sudden behavioral change. If your cat hasn't been spayed or neutered, this is something you might consider. The physical change could impact their behavior (by becoming less aggressive) but should be discussed with a vet prior to any decisions.</p><h2>Understand the Triggers</h2><p>If your cat has been cleared of any medical issues, it's important to figure out the cat's tolerance levels and reactive distance. For instance, your kitty may be fine as long as the trigger stays six feet away, but reacts with fear at five feet. Avoid situations by maintaining an appropriate distance between the fearful cat and potential triggers. Then slowly work up to reducing the distance or gently increasing the time spent with the trigger, showing the cat that there is no reason to be fearful. How you ease into the trigger can depend on what the exact trigger is. Speak with your vet to help with suggestions, especially if the cat's trigger is something that absolutely cannot be avoided.</p><h2>Create Safe Spaces</h2><p>Increase the numbers of quiet areas and hiding spots available to your cat in the home. Elevated perches such as shelf space and small boxes to hide make cats feel more secure. Create a house of plenty by providing lots of toys, scratching posts, and litter boxes (at least one per cat plus one) to reduce competition with other cats.</p><h2>Ease Stress</h2><p>Visual contact heightens cat arousal and can increase aggressive episodes or make them worse. If another cat is causing stress, separate the cats with solid doors to calm the angst. Use Feliway or a similar cat pheromone product to ease stress in the cat's territory. Rescue Remedy or other flower essences can help shy and fearful pets, so add several drops to their water.</p><h2>Focus on Play and Training</h2><p>Use interactive play to build feline confidence. A fishing pole toy or the beam of a light pointer allows the cat to have fun with you but from a distance, which is not likely to trigger an attack. Training cats to do tricks builds confidence and helps improve the bond you share. You can use clicker training to communicate with your cat and show approval. When the cat's fear aggression focuses on another cat, use positive reinforcement and counter-conditioning techniques to reduce the cat-on-cat aggression.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>A common mistake is to expect fear aggression to be eliminated immediately. If you can recognize the trigger, it will still take time, practice, and consistency to help your cat eliminate the fear aggression. Don't be surprised if they have relapses and don't scold your cat, as that will only make it worse. If the fear aggression cannot be eliminated or you are having a particularly tough time identifying the trigger, it may be time for professional help. A vet or seasoned feline behavior specialist will be able to assist you and your cat.</p>",800
20,https://www.thesprucepets.com/do-cats-know-their-own-names-5248824,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>Do Cats Know Their Own Names?</h1>,"<h1>Do Cats Know Their Own Names?</h1><p>Have you ever wondered if cats know their names? Unlike dogs, cats are not known for coming when called. But if your cat doesn 't move a whisker when you call its name, it doesn 't necessarily mean that it doesn 't know its name.</p><p>According to a study published in 2019 in the journal , cats do, in fact, recognize their own names. The lead author of the study is a behavioral scientist named Atsuko Saito from Sophia University in Tokyo, whose prior research demonstrated that cats can recognize their owners ' voices.</p><p>For the name recognition study, researchers observed cats living in ordinary households, as well as cats living in cat cafes. Although the cafe cats could distinguish their own names from general nouns, they were not able to distinguish their own names from the names of other cats living in the cafe. The house cats, on the other hand, were able to discriminate their own names from general nouns and from the names of other cats living in the home. This led the researchers to conclude that cats can differentiate the content of human language based on phonemic differences.</p><h2>Why Is My Cat Ignoring Me?</h2><p>If we know that cats are capable of recognizing their names, why don 't they come running when we call their names? It 's simply a case of a cat being a cat. Humans tend to compare cats and dogs, but we really shouldn 't expect the same types of behaviors from these two very different species. Our feline friends are aloof and more independent than dogs and don 't always see the need to respond when you say their name.</p><p>Some cats do come running when you call their name. If you have a cat like this, congratulations! Cats that readily engage with you and respond to your vocal utterances are lots of fun to live with. Such cats are often described as dog-likedue to their extra devotion to their people.</p><h2>Be Patient If You Change Your Cat's Name</h2><p>There are some instances where a cat actually might not know its name, for instance, if you have a kitten who has been given its first-ever name, or if you bring home a newly adopted adult cat and choose a brand-new name. Adopted adult cats might even been on their third or fourth name, depending on the circumstances, so it 's understandable if they don 't respond to their newest name right away.</p><p>If your cat doesn 't react when you say its name, it 's possible that it doesn 't know its name yet. The good news is that cats can easily learn their new names. Although your cat would probably learn its new name with enough time, there are ways to speed up the name learning process a bit.</p><h2>How to Teach Your Cat Its Name</h2><p>You might be surprised to learn that you can train cats to recognize their name. You can teach your cat its name (or refresh its memory) the same way you can teach any new behavior. Follow these easy steps to teach your cat its name.</p><p>First, try not using your cat 's name too much. Saying your cat 's name over and over can lead your cat to tune it out like background noise. Especially when you are trying to teach your cat a new name, stick to using it during training sessions. Later, you can say the name more freely; your cat should now recognize it.</p><p>Next, create a positive association with your cat 's name by pairing the name with a tasty treat. Use something your cat really likes, such as tiny bits of plain chicken or a favorite treat broken up into small pieces.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Say your cat 's name, then immediately give it a treat. Say your cat 's name again, and give it another treat. Do this about 10 times within a few minutes time, then take a break. As the training sessions progress, be sure to mix your cat's name in with other words and talk as you usually would, but only reward with a treat when its name is said. This way, your cat will associate the treat with its name, rather than the sound of your voice alone. Practice the name game every day, about two to three times a day (morning, noon and night is good), for as long as it takes for your cat to recognized its name.</p>",736
21,https://www.thesprucepets.com/when-your-cat-acts-like-a-baby-4160980,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Basic Training,<h1>7 Times Your Cat Acts Exactly Like a Baby</h1>,"<h1>7 Times Your Cat Acts Exactly Like a Baby</h1><p>If you 're like most pet parents, your cat has probably become a member of your family. And, hopefully, the same goes for your kiddos.</p><p>That 's why it 's not so hard to believe that there are many, many similarities between your cat and your human baby or toddler. Sure, they 're both small, cute (hopefully), cuddly, and vital members of the family tree-but those aren 't the similarities we 're talking about here.</p><p>Read on to learn why cats and babies are basically the same things-just with varying amounts of fur and whiskers.</p><h2>Whenever You Do Anything to Ensure Their Health and Happiness</h2><p>When it comes down to it, there isn 't much cats and babies can do on their own. Considering their lack of thumbs (cats) and dexterity (babies), general lack of street smarts, and their inability to make a living, they 've become pretty reliant on the rest of us.</p><p>It 's a good thing most cat parents (or human parents, for that matter) don 't expect any favors in return. After years of feeding, cleaning, poop-picking-up, and providing shelter, clothing, education, and general love and affection, the score is probably pretty unbalanced.</p><h2>Every Time Your Cat Poops</h2><p>There are a number of similarities between cats and babies, but the trait they have most in common? The fact that they can poop at any time, in any location, and someone else will have to clean it up. Sounds like the life, huh? In fact, your cat is probably somewhere in your house, pooping in one of your strategically placed litter boxes right at this moment.</p><p>If you have kids, take a moment and try to estimate the number of diapers you 've changed in your lifetime; if you have a cat, take a moment to reflect on all the time you 've spent elbow-deep in kitty litter. They 're not dissimilar jobs, after all.</p><h2>When Your Cat Cries (And Actually Sounds Like a Human)</h2><p>Studies have shown that cat owners can determine their kitties ' needs by the sound and pitch of their meows. In other words, a cat owner can tell the difference between a meow that means I 'm hungryand a meow that means Clean up my poop, human. </p><p>One particular type of meow-one that means your cat needs and it 's your job to figure it out-sounds just like a human baby crying. Yep, according to science, some cats can meow at the same frequency as an infant 's cry.</p> <h2>When Your Cat Has Random Outbursts</h2><p>How many times per week does your cat boop you on the face? Or bounce off the walls for a few moments before settling back into a cozy spot on the couch? It 's not uncommon for cats to get these random bursts of energy or aggression-and it 's actually good for them to get rid of that excess energy. The same can be said of toddlers.</p><h2>When Your Cat Wears a Cute Little Holiday Outfit</h2><p>Throughout their lives, most kids have special occasion outfits. You know-the pastel floral dress for Easter, the red, white, and blue ensemble for the Fourth of July, and an itchy turtleneck for Thanksgiving.</p><p>And if you 're an extra cat parent, your kitty probably has those special occasion outfits, too. The bunny ears she won 't keep on for more than 15 seconds for Easter, the red, white, and blue kitty-sized tutu for the Fourth, and a tiny pilgrim outfit for Thanksgiving. And let's not forget Halloween.</p><h2>When Your Cat Clings Onto You</h2><p>Man, cats and babies are clingy, right? Being little clinger-ons is one trait cats and babies share-but the meanings are totally different. Obviously, babies cling onto their parents because they love them, feel protected by them, and need to feed them lunch.</p><p>Cats like to rub against us and cling on because they love us, too, right? Wrong.</p><p>When a kitty rubs against your leg, they're not giving you a sweet, little leg hug-they 're marking you as their property. When they press against you (and maybe even curl their tail around your leg), the scent glands go into overdrive. These scent glands release their markthat lets any other animals in the area know you are theirproperty-and they better back off.</p><p>There they go again, manipulating our emotions. &shy;&shy;</p><h2>Every Year in Your Holiday Card</h2><p>Holiday cards are meant to provide family updates to friends and family you don 't see regularly. And if you have cute kids, they can help you brag it up a little bit, too.</p><p>The same goes for kitties. How else will your friends and family know she learned how to walk on a leash outdoors or finally stopped puking on your bed pillows?</p>",777
22,https://www.thesprucepets.com/weird-cat-behaviors-explained-553972,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Weird Cat Behaviors You're Not Sure About</h1>,"<h1>Weird Cat Behaviors You're Not Sure About</h1><h2>Oddball Cat Communication Methods and Quirks</h2><p>Does your cat's behavior confuse and frustrate you, making you think you are the only one with such a crazy cat? You are not the only one, and surprisingly your cat might be considered completely normal. Learn about 22 weird cat behaviors, why cats do them, and how you can learn to live with them-or even enjoy your quirky kitty's antics.</p><h3>If Your Cat Could Text, They Would Say This</h3><h2>Rolling Over</h2><p>Does your cat flip-that is, throw itself on the ground at your feet and roll? Is it under the influence of catnip, or is something else going on? When your cat rolls over it typically signals that the cat feels safe and maybe wants some attention from you. Your cat can also mark the area with its scent this way, claiming your space as its own.</p><h2>Presenting Its Butt</h2><p>Does your kitty's butt go sky-high when you pet or scratch it? That's called an ""elevator butt"" pose and it's a good thing. Your cat's action is a backhanded compliment and kitty-correct, letting you know you've hit the spot and to continue the petting. What about when your cat puts its butt right into your face? Good news there, too. A raised tail is an invitation to another cat for a gracious butt sniff to say hello. When your cat does this to you, it's like giving a hug and kiss when greeting a friend. The good news is that you don't have to sniff your cat's hind end to reciprocate. Instead, you can pet your cat or scratch where it likes it best.</p><h2>Covering Poop</h2><p>All cats do this. Or do they? Cats communicate volumes in the litter box and sometimes they want their (ahem) potty graffiti available for the world to see. Cats usually learn their litter box etiquette from their mothers, and domestic cats have long been encouraged to cover their excrement. However, a cat might leave it unburied to claim territory.</p><h2>Covering Food</h2><p>Everyone has heard of finicky cats. And some cats make clear their gustatory preferences by covering up the food bowl. If your cat is covering its food after eating some of it, it may be an instinctive behavior as wild felines cache their food to keep it safe from others. Your kitten or cat may scratch around its food bowl after eating or even find shredded paper to cover it up.</p><h2>Eating Plastic</h2><p>Selmer van Alten / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>You arrive home from the grocery store, and before you can say ""Scat!"" you catch your cat licking the plastic bags. If not caught in time, some cats even eat plastic. Kittens may chew on anything while teething and may have developed a fondness for the texture of plastic they will carry into adulthood. Also, the bag might just taste good to the cat. However, plastic can be a choking hazard or cause intestinal obstruction, so you want to discourage it by providing safe chew toys.</p><h2>Eating Grass, Leaves, and Plants</h2><p>Do your cats eat green stuff? Cats are carnivores, but they also often enjoy getting trace nutrients from nibbling on grass and other greenery, even leaves. In the wild, they would get these nutrients by eating the intestinal contents of their prey. Just watch your houseplants and cut flowers because cats love anything that screams foliage and toxicity may be an issue with many flowers.</p><h2>Sneering</h2><p>Dennis Yang / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>The technical term for that distinctive open-mouth grimace is the flehmen response, but it sure looks like a feline sneer. It's doubtful you'll ever see your cat aim this sneer your way, as it's a reaction reserved for other cats, or rather, their invisible messages. They are picking up pheromones that other cats have marked in the environment. The motion of trapping the pheromone with the tongue against a duct in the roof of the mouth produces the lip curl. Male cats do this lip curl more often.</p><h2>Winking</h2><p>Sarah Sphar / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><p>When your cat ""winks"" at you, is it flirting? That might be one way to interpret the kitty eye communication, sometimes called a cat kiss. A slow cat-eye blink is a wonderful compliment. It is a non-threat signal that cats use with each other as well as with humans they are comfortable with. You can send the same signal to your cat, slowly shutting and then opening your eyes. Chances are, your cat will return the cat-kiss eye blink.</p><h2>Kneading and Treading</h2><p>Those rear-treading paws rev the kitty engine right before a burst of speed, while the front paw treading (kneading) offers a more reflective emotion. Front paw kneading is generally believed to be a leftover nursing behavior that kittens use to stimulate the release of milk from their mothers. In adult cats, you will mostly see it when they are happy and satisfied. As a bonus, the kneading releases the cat's scent and marks its territory. Rear-foot treading is done before and after mating as well as when hunting and the cat is about to launch an attack.</p><h2>Interrupting Phone Calls</h2><p>Does your cat want to phone home? If it is interrupting your time on the phone, at the keyboard, or when reading, your cat is jealous of you giving attention to these objects rather than to your fur baby. The solution is to give your cat more one-on-one time as well as interactive toys to keep it stimulated.</p><h2>Butting Heads</h2><p>Cats' unique behavior includes bunting-that odd way your cat head-butts you. The technical term is bunting and refers to the way a cat presses and rubs its head against objects. Another technical term, allorubbing, refers to the way cats rub their bodies against another cat, a human, or even a trusted family dog. This is done to mark you with their scent and claim you as their own.</p><h2>Chattering and Chirping</h2><p>A cat vocalizes in many ways. You've probably heard it chittering and chattering, most likely when your cat is looking out the window at birds or other potential prey. If you have multiple cats, you may have caught them chirping with each other during what looks like a kitty coffee klatch. Chirping and chattering are sounds of conversation and excitement over the thrill of the hunt it senses outside.</p><h2>Sitting in Boxes</h2><p>Cats, much like little kids, often prefer to play with the box a gift came in over the toy itself. Put even the tiniest empty box on the floor and your furry pudge muffin will try to squeeze itself into it. Your cat's passion for boxes is a natural instinct. Felines are hunters and love to hide in small spaces before surprising their prey, making a box the perfect hideout. The texture of a box, often cool and smooth, can also feel good to a cat. Just make sure the box is safe to play in, minus staples or packing peanuts that can tempt a cat to chew.</p><h2>Knocking Things Over</h2><p>Cats love to knock things over-and watch them break. Though not the most endearing behavior, it's probably your pet's way of telling you it's bored, needs attention, and wants to play. As you probably already know, scolding your cat won't help to eliminate this problem. To minimize this frustrating behavior, it helps to enrich your cat's day with more interactive toys and puzzle feeding dishes to make your kitty work for its kibble.</p>",1220
23,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-stop-destructive-scratching-in-cats-4588686,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Stop Destructive Scratching in Cats</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Destructive Scratching in Cats</h1> <p>Cats causing damage by scratching furniture and other household items is a common complaint among cat owners. Although, this can be frustrating, it is important to remember that scratching is a normal and natural behavior for cats.</p><p>Even though the urge for cats to scratch is normal, scratching places we feel are inappropriate, such as our couches and stairway posts, makes it a destructive behavior. Luckily, this is one which can be easily prevented and managed.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Scratch?</h2><p>Scratching is an instinctive cat behavior, and it's vital for their physical and mental needs. By understanding your cat 's scratching behavior, you can prevent damage to your home. There are various reasons why cats scratch.</p><h2>How Can I Prevent My Cat From Scratching?</h2><p>The short answer is you can 't. Scratching is a normal behavior for your cat. It is unreasonable to expect this behavior to simply not exist. Cats are going to scratch, and we need to provide appropriate outlets for them to express and experience this natural and instinctive behavior.</p><h2>How to Stop Destructive Scratching</h2><p>Cats need to scratch so we want to provide them with appropriate outlets for this behavior by providing suitable surfaces to scratch.</p><p>Always have plenty of acceptable scratching areas for your cat with a variety of surfaces and textures. Scratchers come in multiples styles, sizes, and materials.</p><p>It is important to experiment with a variety of substrates and types of scratchers to determine which your cat prefers. Some examples of what most cats prefer are scratching posts or pads made with sisal rope, cardboard, wood, and sisal fabric. It is best to offer both horizontal and vertical scratching surfaces. Scratchers should be sturdy and not wobbly or fall over when your cat is scratching them. Cat scratching posts need to be tall. Your cat should be able to stand on their hind legs and fully extend their body up the side of the post so they can get a full-body stretch.</p><p>The placement of scratchers is important. Our cats like to be with us so place them in areas where you spend time as well as where your cats spend their time. Cats often stretch or scratch when they wake up, so consider placing one near where your cats sleep. Cats also scratch when in a tense situation or as a way to displace anxiety. Locate and place scratchers in all the areas where you think your cats would appreciate it most.</p><h2>Make Appropriate Scratching Areas Appealing</h2><p>Do not hold your cat near the scratching post and force her to drag their claws on it. We don 't enjoy being forced to do things and neither do cats. This can scare your cat and cause them to avoid the scratcher completely.</p><p>Instead, make the scratching areas you want the cat to scratch more appealing. You can do this by placing catnip or silvervine near them or attaching toys to the scratching place. You can give your cats treats and play with them on or around it too to help create a positive association with the scratcher.</p><p>Lastly, because one of the reasons cats scratch is to communicate through scent, you can apply Feliscratch. Feliscratch is a product that has been created by Feliway to mimic the scent that cats spread to other cats when scratching. By mimicking your cats ' messages, Feliscratch encourages your cats to scratch there again.</p><h2>Positively Redirect</h2><p>If your cat is scratching furniture, identify your cat 's preferred scratching scenario by studying where your cat inappropriately scratches, Is it horizontal? Vertical? What substrate is it most similar to? Cardboard? Wood?</p><p>Based on your cat's preferences, buy scratching posts or pads that are similar to your cat's preferred scratching set up. Place an acceptable scratching post based on your cat's preferences near an inappropriate object (for example, couch).</p><p>When your cat is consistently using the scratching post it can be moved very gradually (no more than a few inches each day) to a location more suitable to you. It's best, however, to keep the appropriate scratching objects as close to your cat's preferred scratching locations as possible.</p><h2>Reinforce Scratching</h2><p>When your cat is scratching their scratchers, reward them with a treat, verbal praise, or a pet. Remember, what one cat finds reinforcing may not be reinforcing to another cat so reward your cat in a way they enjoy.</p><h2>Regular Claw Trimming</h2><p>Since claws don 't wear down naturally, your kitty needs to groom them by scratching a textured surface, like your furniture or carpets. Regular toenail clipping helps prevent destructive clawing, and also helps prevent her nails from getting snagged and torn on anything.</p><p>Take a deep breath and be gentle and calm. Prior to starting, purchase specific cat nail trimmers that are comfortable to handle, are rubber coated to avoid slipping, and that have a stainless steel blade.</p><p>Clip one nail and offer a treat at the same time. If your cat stays relaxed, then trim the second nail while the cat is eating; if your cat stays relaxed, build up to trimming five nails in one session. Be ready, at first, to only clip one paw, or even only one or two claws, while your cat gets used to it.</p><p>Most cats ' experiences with nail trims are far from positive, which results in cats not liking nail trims. Before starting, have some delicious, extra special treats your cats only get during nail trims. A few examples are canned food, whip cream, tuna fish, and anchovy paste. You can also give your cat a cuddle, brush, or play session after depending on their preferences.</p><p>Within a cat 's nail, there 's a pink part higher up called the quick. It contains all the nerves and blood vessels, meaning that if you cut into it, it will be painful for your kitty and will bleed. When cutting the nails, it's easy to see where the quick starts, so you can avoid nicking it. If you do cut into it by accident, you can stop the bleeding fairly quickly with a styptic powder.</p><h2>Environmental Enrichment</h2><p>A boring environment can lead to destructive scratching and other behavioral issues, so it's important to provide cats with enrichment to help prevent this. Providing enrichment for your cat allows your cat to express these behaviors. An enriched environment should provide various types of scratching surfaces, outlets for predatory and prey behavior, safe places, and should provide an environment in which an animal has variety, choice, and control over their daily activities.</p><h2>The Problem With Declawing</h2><p>Scratching is an instinctive behavior needed for your cat's physical and emotional well-being. Unlike human nails, which grow from skin, cats ' claws grow from the last bone in each of their toes. Declawing (onychectomy) is the amputation of this bone, which also involves cutting the tendons, nerves, and ligaments to which the bone is attached. It is a major surgical procedure that can put your cat at risk for a variety of physical and behavioral problems. In many countries around the world declawing is illegal, as it is considered inhumane.</p>",1159
24,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-train-a-kitten-555146,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Reasons Why Kittens Misbehave and How to Stop It</h1>,"<h1>Reasons Why Kittens Misbehave and How to Stop It</h1><p>Kittens, like children, learn how to behave appropriately at a young age-and during this process, they might often misbehave. Kittens are constantly learning about the world around them and acquaint themselves with good behavior through positive and negative enforcement. If you're training your kitten to stop misbehaving, you'll have to address and correct the bad behaviors.</p><p>Patience is key when training a kitten, and we're sharing tips for correcting common misbehavior, like scratching, biting, and jumping.</p><h2>Why Do Kittens Misbehave?</h2><p>Kittens are like babies. The are constantly learning about the world around them and what behavior is acceptable and what isn't through positive and negative reinforcement. When your kitten misbehaves, it's not trying to be ""bad."" It's simply learning how to behave.</p><p>Most kittens are happy to use a litter box and scratching post. Sometimes kittens are unwilling or unable to do one or the other. Occasionally, they start using the litter box and scratching post properly and then suddenly stop doing so.</p><p>Much of kitten or cat discipline involves troubleshooting to discover the reason for the undesirable behavior and then correcting the situations that caused it.</p><h2>Scratching and Clawing</h2><p>Kittens and cats should keep their claws and they need to scratch to keep their claws healthy. The trick is to redirect them from furniture and other objects to more appropriate surfaces for them to sharpen their claws. The key is teaching the kitten to avoid destructive scratching.</p><h2>Litter Box Training</h2><p>Most kittens readily adapt to a litter box, especially if they were raised with a mother cat. Otherwise, it's usually easy to train a kitten to use the box. Make sure the box is easily accessible, filled with good-quality litter, and cleaned at least once a day. Immediately after a meal, place your kitten in the box. You may have to demonstrate by guiding its paw for a few scratches in the litter, but the kitty will quickly get the idea. Chances are, under proper circumstances, your kitten will not make mistakes and learn to use the box regularly. In the rare event your kitten doesn't take to the box, poor litter box maintenance may be the cause.</p><h2>Chewing and Biting</h2><p>Like human babies, kittens examine everything with their mouths, especially when they're teething. As with toddlers, it's important to keep harmful items out of kittens' reach. Kittens love to ""play fight,"" and if other cats aren't around to accommodate them, they'll settle for the nearest human hand or ankle, especially if you've encouraged this form of play early on. They also might chew on houseplants if they are in reach.</p><h2>Jumping</h2><p>Kittens love heights, and many are expert jumpers. They can hurl themselves upward with little notice and seemingly little effort. Problems occur when they frequently jump on a tabletop or a countertop that you prefer they avoided.</p><h2>Nighttime Behavior</h2><p>Cats and especially kittens can exhibit overactive behavior at night. Most cats will be awake and active at night, but the key is teaching them to leave you alone and how to go back to sleep.</p><h2>Attention Seeking Disobedience</h2><p>Some kittens are especially rambunctious. While kittens are expected to be curious and playful, some can escalate these traits to bad behavior. They are likely seeking attention from their owners or are bored and under-stimulated (or both).</p><h2>How to Stop Bad Behavior</h2><p>There are numerous humane effective techniques for expressing your displeasure with a cat. It's always wise to check with your vet to make sure there isn't a health issue causing the bad behavior. One simple option is to keep a spray bottle filled with water handy. This can help when you see bad behavior in action. Give your kitten a little squirt to discourage the behavior.</p><h2>Provide Scratching Posts</h2><p>To stop your cat scratching furniture or other places it doesn't belong, provide desirable scratching surfaces. Scratching posts vary in price and style and provide a selection of scratching surfaces for your kitten. One popular and inexpensive option is a corrugated cardboard model. Adding a small amount of catnip to the scratch post can make it more attractive for your cat. For a variety of healthy scratching options, offer as many scratchers as you can afford and/or have room for.</p><h2>Manage Your Kitten's Claws</h2><p>While harmful to your kitten's health to have it declawed, it's a good idea to trim those needle-sharp claws from time to time. Not only will this make destructive scratching less of an issue, but it will also lessen the chance that you'll be scratched by an energetic feline playmate. Another option is to use plastic nail caps. They are easy to apply and do not interfere with the normal extension and retraction of your cat's claws.</p><h2>Keep the Litter Box Clean</h2><p>Because litter box avoidance is a major cause of surrenders of cats to shelters, it's important to provide your cat with an immaculately clean litter box. Another option is to spray your kitten's litter box with an attractive scent, such as Cat Attract, which is sold at pet stores. Provide multiple boxes for your cat. You also may need to try several brands and types of litter. Some cats avoid covered litter boxes, while others prefer the privacy they provide. Be sure there are no underlying health issues, such as a urinary tract infection, that may be causing your kitten to miss the litter box. Your veterinarian should be able to easily rule out this and other illnesses with a simple urinalysis.</p><h2>Avoid Play Fighting</h2><p>While play fighting with your kitten can be fun, it can escalate. Kittens learn to inhibit the severity of biting and scratching from their litter-mates and mother. If they bite or scratch too hard, they will be reprimanded with a growl or hiss and an equally rough swat or bite right back. If your kitten was separated from its family too early, it may not have learned proper play fighting behavior. Consider wearing gloves, using toys instead of hands, or simply walking away if your kitten gets too rough. This will help the cat learn to avoid biting or scratching, even in play. Remove tempting plants or put them in an area that is off-limits to your kitten.</p><h2>Set Boundaries for Jumping</h2><p>Ideally, you'll have rules in mind for your kitten before it starts leaping. Which counters, couches, and shelves are fair game? Which are off-limits? A simple training method involves praising and petting your kitten when it leaps onto acceptable surfaces while scolding and removing it from unacceptable surfaces. The spray bottle can help train your kitten to stay off specific surfaces. Double-sided sticky tape can discourage some cats from jumping as they dislike the feel of the tape on their paws. Providing alternative climbing surfaces, such as a cat tree, may also help reduce the chance of your cat jumping on your countertops.</p><h2>Daytime Activity</h2><p>Plan on some interactive play sessions with your kitten in the evening. Keep playing until your kitten seems to tire. Feed them a bigger meal before bedtime; most cats sleep after eating. Keep your cat busy during the day with playful and challenging toys or puzzles.</p><h2>Stopping Attention Seeking Disobedience</h2><p>Always play with your kitten every day. Some extra quality time may be helpful in stopping the bad behavior. Disobedient cats may also be bored, so provide stimulation and exercise. Finally, praise the cat when it is being good. Use kind words, gentle petting, and treats to reinforce good behavior.</p>",1215

Some cats are naturally anxious while others can suddenly feel anxiety due to an underlying cause.</p><p>Anxiety in cats can arise from many different issues. Veterinarians and behavior specialists look at the cat 's physical and emotional health, as well as instinct traits to help figure out what 's going on and find solutions. You can apply the H.I.S.S. test (health, instinct, stress, and symptoms) to discuss and figure out ways to reduce your feline's anxiety.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Owners often report their cats have occasional fights. If this is the case in your home, try placing a belled collar on the aggressor cat(s). This will give the victim warning so the kitty can avoid encounters.</p><h2>Check for Health and Behavior Causes</h2><p>Cats that do not feel good can react with anxious behavior. Kitties have evolved to be great pretendersand never let on that they feel bad. Stoic cats with hidden aches show only subtle signs, if at all. A hurt paw may not cause a limp but instead prompts the cat to hide or become clingy, for example. Resolving an underlying health issue often relieves anxious behaviors.</p><p>For a cat, the unknown equals danger. Wild kitties that failed to honor this truth were taken out of the gene pool, while properly cautious catssurvived to breed and passed on this caution geneto future generations. Being cautious and hiding are survival instincts, so your cat may naturally be a little more anxious than others.</p><h2>Reduce Stress</h2><p>Stress is one of the major causes of anxiety and one that you have a certain level of control over. How cats react to stress depends greatly on their personality, how well they were socialized as kittens and even genetics. A certain percentage of kitties (and dogs and people and other critters) simply are born prone to be more nervous. </p><p>has the potential to increase stress and anxiety, but the cat's environment ranks at the top of the list. Environmental stressors include crowded conditions, climate, resource availability, and especially living and competing with other cats.</p><p>To address environmental stressors, try creating a cat considerate environment: lots of feline resources that offer healthy outlets for normal and typical cat behaviors. Once you figure out what cats do most of the time, you can make those activities even more agreeable which reduces the potential stress and anxiety.</p><h2>Provide a Cat Tree</h2><p>Cats prefer to hide in dark places where they can 't easily be seen. They also like inaccessible places where they can 't be reached and can most easily defend. Confident cats often seek out high resting spots, while anxious ones may resort to ground level hiding. Favorites include under the bed or other low-to-the-ground furniture, basements, under stairs, in closets, or inside boxes or piles of clutter.</p><p>Since cats spend a lot of time sleeping or resting, you can help an anxious cat by giving them the ideal cat tree. Offer a variety of perching opportunities throughout the house to reduce arguments over ownership in multi-cat households. Cats tend to stretch and scratch upon awakening, so placing scratch objects near resting spots can make kitty more comfortable as well.</p><h2>Combine Food and Fun</h2><p>Cats spend part of their waking hours either hunting or eating. You can address both by using food puzzle toys or creating a treasure huntwith small portions on dishes laid out around the house. Playing and exploration mimics hunting behaviors and can reduce stress and anxiety. Homemade toys motivate cats to explore, and rotating toys increases novelty and interest.</p><h2>Improve the Litter Box Experience</h2><p>Anxious cats urinate outside of the box either with urine sprayed against vertical surfaces or by squatting to wet flat surfaces. This most commonly has territorial/marking aspects, with the cat using the scent to identify ownedproperty, warn off other animals, or self-comfort with the cat 's familiar scent. Common targets for urine include property important to the cat: owner-scented objects such as the bed, near windows or other lookouts (where they see stray cats), or by doors (where they hear or smell stray cats).</p><p>To prevent a lot of this behavior, provide the best litter boxes possible and situate them throughout the home in a variety of locations instead of clustered in one area. The one-plus-one rule (one box per cat plus one) reduces anxiety because cats don 't have to share.</p><p>It's also important to keep all litter boxes clean. A dirty box will discourage proper elimination and can cause or enhance any anxious feelings.</p><h2>Offer Natural Anxiety Relief</h2><p>Another option is to use scent and natural remedies to relieve some of your kitty's anxiety. Feliway is one popular choice that comes in diffuser or spray bottles. It is a synthetic feline facial pheromone that helps ease tension related to territorial and environmental stress.</p><p>Rescue Remedy, or one of the other more specific Bach Flower Remedies, can be particularly helpful for anxious cats. There is one specifically designed for pets, which can be found in many pet stores.</p><p>Do be careful about some aromatherapy products, especially if they are not pet-specific. A number of essential oils are potentially toxic to cats. These can cause health problems-some of which are very serious-and that may increase your cat's anxiety.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behaviors</h2><p>Cats may not immediately adjust to any changes you make, so be patient. If you have eliminated potential health concerns, do your best to make your cat's environment as calm and inviting as possible. If one thing doesn't seem to be working, add another one of the suggestions and see how the cat reacts to the combination.</p><p>At the same time, remember that change can stress a cat. Try not to make too many changes all at once. Likewise, if your household has experienced a change recently-moving to a new home, a new or loss of a family member, or even rearranging the furniture-do your best to provide your cat with familiar things. A favorite toy or old scratching post can bring a good deal of comfort to your cat.</p><p>While waiting for your cat to come around, try to maintain a calm, stress-free home as much as possible. You don't need to walk on eggshells for fear of disturbing the cat, however, and they should get used to your ""normal"" home. With time, many anxious cats settle in and find comfort.</p>",1052
26,https://www.thesprucepets.com/avoid-cat-related-sleep-deprivation-555650,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Waking You Up at Night</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Waking You Up at Night</h1><h2>Keep your cat from ruining your sleep</h2><p>Does your cat constantly wake you up at night by playing on the bed, lobbying to be fed, or soliciting cuddle time when all you want to do is sleep? Your cat is most likely seeking attention, leading to a disturbance in your sleep cycle.</p><p>Your good night's sleep is extremely important to your health and shouldn't be interrupted by your kitty. There's no need to suffer from cat-related sleep deprivation, though. Below, we break down why your cat might be waking you at night and how to solve this behavioral issue.</p><h2>Why Does Your Cat Wake You at Night?</h2><p>In their natural habitats, cats are nocturnal creatures. They sleep almost all day and play or hunt all night. There are a few reasons why your kitty might be prompted to wake you up in the dead of the night.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Take note if your cat is old and/or its nighttime friskiness is new or unusual behavior. Whenever your cat exhibits off behavior, wakes at night for no reason, seems to be sickly, or displays other symptoms that it's sick, check with your vet right away.</p><p>Unusual bouts of interrupted sleep can be a sign of illness, ranging from pain from a toothache or arthritis to something more serious like hyperthyroidism, diabetes or neurological conditions.</p><h2>How to Stop Your Cat From Waking You</h2><p>There are a number of techniques that you can try to train (or retrain) your cat not to wake you up at night. Some will require some behavior modifications on the pet owners part, so make sure that all family members are on board with the changes. Before you go to bed, decide how you will react to your cat. The middle of the night is not the best time to make a decision.</p><h3>Schedule Playtime and Snacks</h3><p>Help your cat to readjust its internal clock by scheduling an interactive hour-long play period about an hour before bedtime. Follow the play session with a light kitty-appropriate snack like a small treat, which should leave your cat not angling for food in the middle of the night.</p><p>If your cat wakes you up anyway, ignore it. After trying this a few times, your cat will learn that it's not getting the attention it wants from you and may leave you alone.</p><h3>Don't Let Your Cat Sleep in Your Bed</h3><p>If you have a sleep disorder, it's best never to encourage your cat to sleep on your bed. This means making your bedroom off-limits at all times. Give your cat a comfortable cat bed in a spare room, a corner of the living room (with a screen for privacy), or even a bathroom. If you do this, make sure wherever the cat is kept at night that it has access to water and litterpan. Try rubbing a bit of catnip on the bed initially to encourage the cat to use it.</p><h3>Adopt Another Cat</h3><p>A single cat may easily become bored when it's home alone all day and may expect its human companion to provide attention at night. A second cat may offer companionship during the day and may lessen those nocturnal urges to wake you for play. This is especially true of kittens, who have much more energy to burn during their first year of growth. Two kittens are almost always better than one and often is a great time for cats to be introduced. Selecting a second adult cat for your home to get along with your first adult cat can be very difficult and should be done carefully so that your initial cat has a companion that does not cause it stress or vice versa.</p><h3>Avoid Feeding Your Cat Immediately</h3><p>If your cat interrupts your sleep early in the morning to seek breakfast, avoid feeding it at the time of its demand or it will continue to wake you up this early. Having a safe, designated area such as a spare bedroom where your cat can sleep, eat and drink and potty that is not in your bedroom can be helpful to your sleep schedule and relationship with your cat.</p><h3>Set a Schedule</h3><p>Cats don't like surprises and are most happy when their household revolves around a predictable schedule. Giving your cat a set time for food, exercise, interactive play, grooming, and petting will go a long way toward maintaining its well-being and giving you a good night's sleep, every night.</p><h2>How to Prevent Your Cat From Waking You</h2><p>If you find yourself awakened by a noisy or annoying cat, try to create a peaceful environment to help you (and your cat) get some restful sleep. Again, make sure that all family members are aware of the steps you are taking. If you ignore your cat, but someone else feeds in the middle of the night, the ignoring is for nothing.</p><h3>Keep Your Door Closed</h3><p>Even if you close your bedroom door to your cat, a determined feline might scratch at the door for a while, but it will eventually give up and either go to sleep or find some other activity. You can help prevent damage to your door by either mounting a vertical scratch pad on it, trimming your kitty's nails regularly, or having your vet fit your cat with plastic nail caps.</p><h3>Try Soothing Sounds</h3><p>A number of commercial products are available that play soothing sounds that may help you sleep (with your cat on the other side of the door). You can select from bird sounds, ocean or waterfall sounds, or just white noise. Earphones or earbuds will help amplify and enhance the sleep-inducing effects.</p><h3>Keep Your Room Dark</h3><p>Try to prevent those pouncing, biting attacks on your toes at night by using room-darkening shades to completely darken your room. Replace any digital or fluorescent-dial clocks by the bedside with non-illuminated versions or just use your phone.</p><h3>Try Earplugs</h3><p>If all else fails and your cat's noises or scratching at the door keeps you awake, use swimmers' earplugs, which effectively seal the ear canal and should give you some relief.</p>",995
27,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reduce-cat-stress-3384587,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Low Stress Travel to the Vet With Your Cat</h1>,"<h1>Low Stress Travel to the Vet With Your Cat</h1><p>Veterinary visits are a vital part to our cat 's care. Many cats find traveling and carriers to be an unpleasant experience. Most cats don 't have much experience with traveling, and when they do, it isn 't positive, so it makes sense why many cats are not fans of traveling. Although travel can be stressful, there is a lot you can do to make traveling and carriers less stressful and even enjoyable for your cat(s)!</p><h2>It All Starts at Home</h2><p>A successful trip to the vet starts at home with training your cat to like the carrier. The first step is choosing the right carrier for your cat. The carrier you choose for your cat should be large enough for the cat to stand in and turn around and should have easy access to exit and entry ways. A carrier with both top and front openings, or one with a large round opening, will help you get your cat in and out of the carrier more easily. The carrier should have the ability to be taken apart, since this is how cats should be removed from their carriers verses pulling them out and since this allows them to be examined in the bottom of their carrier if they are fearful. Lastly, the carrier should be secure and sturdy.</p><h2>Making the Carrier Positive and Training Your Cat to go in It</h2><p>You purchased the perfect carrier for your cat, so now the next steps are to help your cat associate the carrier with good things. This way it 's not seen as the scary box that only comes out of the garage when they go to the vet. Here are some tips on how to help your cat love the carrier.</p><p>Ideally, work on creating positive associations with the carrier. When your cat needs to go into the carrier for a vet visit, you can use food and toys to lure the cat into the carrier so it 's their choice to enter. If you need to place your cats in the carrier, instead of forcing them through the small door, which often does not go well for you or the cat, you can take the carrier apart and gently place the cat into the carrier.</p><h2>Prepare the Car so it Promotes a Calming Environment</h2><p>We all have our own way of preparing for stressful events. Some of us may meditate or listen to classical music, while others may take a run around the block or rock out to heavy metal music. Our cats are no different, but they rely on us to make their environment calm. Here are a few things you can do to make kitty 's ride less stressful.</p><h2>Practice Proper Cat Carrier Etiquette</h2><p>Yes, there is proper etiquette that should be followed when carrying your cat in their carrier! When you transport your cat, you should support the carrier from the bottom, with one side resting against your chest verses by the handle. Your cat does not want to go on a roller coaster ride! Carrying the carrier in this manner helps your cat to feel more stable and secure. Carrying a carrier from the bottom is also safer and prevents the carrier from falling apart and the cat accidentally getting loose.</p><h2>Properly Secure the Carrier in the Car</h2><p>Many cat owners may be tempted to place the carrier in the passenger seat and use the seatbelt to secure it. While we may think our cat will feel more secure near us, this isn 't the safest option. Instead, we should place carriers on the floor of the vehicle behind the front or passenger seat. This area is the most secure location where there is the least amount of motion.</p><p>Prior to leaving, place a Feliway-infused towel over the carrier, leaving one side uncovered. This allows the cat to hide if they want to and limits visual stimuli. You should also place a non-slip surface in and under crate. Lastly, when driving, to prevent car sickness, accelerate slowly from a stop, allow extra distance between other vehicles to prevent sudden braking, and take turns slowly.</p><p>Remember, it is dangerous to allow your cat to walk around your vehicle unsecured. This can interfere with you driving and cause an accident.</p><h2>Avoid Feeling Rushed</h2><p>Before your visit, be prepared with your cat's medical history. It's also a good idea to leave a little early so you have plenty of time to arrive as scheduled and avoid feeling rushed. When we're rushed, we tend to be more stressed and anxious, and our cats pick up on these emotional cues.</p><h2>Notify the Veterinary Hospital Team When You Arrive</h2><p>Rather than bringing your cat directly into the veterinary hospital when you arrive, call the front desk and let them know that you are in the parking lot. This way they can call or text you when the exam room is ready. This will help prevent the stressors that can occur in a lobby (dogs barking, dogs walking by sniffing the carrier, etc).</p><p>Cats need five to ten minutes to adjust to their new surroundings and feel safe. If you cannot avoid waiting in the lobby, place your cat 's carrier on an elevated surface and cover the front and two sides with a pheromone-infused towel.</p><p>You can also speak to your veterinarian about scheduling your cat 's appointments during quieter times of day. With fewer people in the building, there will be fewer potentially scary sounds, scents, and sights for your cat.</p><p>Along with the tips above, you can train your cat to go in their carriers on cue and happily accept riding in the car breaking the behavior down into small steps and increasing criteria at a pace the cat is comfortable with. Also, if you cat experiences severe stress with travel, talk to your veterinarian about anti-anxiety and anti-nausea medications.</p>",969
28,https://www.thesprucepets.com/indoor-outdoor-cat-safety-552010,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Safe Solutions for Indoor Cats That Want to Go Outside</h1>,"<h1>Safe Solutions for Indoor Cats That Want to Go Outside</h1><p>Cat lovers who want their cats to enjoy fresh air, sunshine, and the ambiance of trees, bushes, and plants, often feel guilt by confining their cats to the indoors. This was the mindset in previous generations: that cats were free and independent creatures and should not be confined. That they cannot be healthy, happy, and active, if not allowed to experience all the glories of the outdoors.</p><p>Today, we understand the hazards of allowing cats to roam freely, either by personal experience, hearsay or through the media, including the Internet. Here are just a few of the outdoors dangers, although not an exhaustive list.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some safe compromises to offer your indoor cat the best of both worlds, without the potential hazards of free-roaming outdoors.</p><h2>Carrying Your Cat</h2><p>Gary Loewenthal, former Host for the About Cats forum used to carry his cat Mike around their backyard, allowing him to sniff and explore at will. Mike's nose led Gary on their walk, and each outdoor expedition was a bit different than the last. These explorations are best kept to a very short time-10 or 15 minutes-as most cats will become too eager to jump down and explore on their own. If you are considering bringing your cat outdoors, it would be best to try this first with your cat in a safe carrier such as their travel bag or a pet stroller. Unpredictable noises or other surprises can startle even the bravest cats when they are not accustomed to being outside. A scared cat could easy wriggle free and run away, or even unintentionally scratch or bite you in their panic.</p><h2>Leash Training</h2><p>Some cats can be trained to wear a harness and leash, using a gradual method of training. Many cats will initially feel confined by the additional weight of the harness, and their first attempts at walking on a leash will appear to be more of the ""slinking"" or ""belly-crawling"" variety. Some cats may also find ways to slip out of the harness or tangle themselves in the leash, so it is best to practice indoors with short sessions to determine if your cat will tolerate this. Given time and patience on the part of the trainer, some cats will enjoy leash walking.</p><p>Some cats may prefer to just ""lie around"" outdoors on their leash, as does our Jaspurr (pictured above), who is a beginner in ""leash etiquette."" Although Jaspurr is at the ""belly-walking"" stage, he eventually may progress to walking with us. It's all a matter of time and patience if your cat is amenable to this activity.</p><p>Please note that tying a cat outside on a leash is not a substitute for personal interaction and supervision. Cats should never be left alone with a leash or a rope extension attached to them. There is too much danger of them becoming tangled up, with the possibility of strangulation, as well as high risks of them slipping out of the leash and running away.</p><p>We recommend a sturdy harness or walking jacket, as opposed to a collar. Collars can be slipped too easily, which will most likely happen in times of fear, such as when meeting a strange dog or cat on the street, loud noises, fast-moving vehicles, or even approaching strangers. Also try to buy as lightweight a leash as possible, consistent with safety. The additional ""drag"" of a bulky leash will slow your cat's walking progress.</p><p>Be sure to test your cat's ""leash quotient"" indoors for several days before taking him outside. Slow introduction and short sessions will give you the best change of getting your cat acclimated to this idea and will result in a cat with a safe and happy indoor-outdoor experience. If after many sessions indoors with lots of positive reinforcement (treats and toys) your cat does not seem to be adjusting or is showing signs of stress or aversion to the harness, consider one of these other safe ways to introduce your cat to the outdoors.</p><h2>A Personal Carrier</h2><p>If you decide that you want to make your cat a ""traveling cat,"" we suggest purchasing a carrier that is comfortable and sturdy to give your cat a safe space to observe the outdoors. We purchased a personal vest-style carrier, called ""Pet Pocket 2,"" manufactured by Global Pet Products. We bought the basic version, with a black mesh ""pocket"" that comfortably held our cat safely with a drawstring adjustment and a metal clip that attaches to his harness. There are many other kinds of carriers on the market as well, so make sure to choose one that gives your cat enough room to comfortably lay down and turn around. You may have to try a few different styles to figure out which one suits your cat best.</p><h2>Wheeled Walker or Stroller</h2><p>The Kittywalk Stroller provides both a durable nylon netting ""cage"" so kitty can enjoy the outdoor experience and a water-resistant canvas shade for protection from the sun. The Wheel Away converts to a backpack, car carrier, and bed. These stroller-style carriers can be a great option since they allow you to take longer walks with your cat without having to carry them, and it keeps your hands free for other things. Many cats feel safe if they have some privacy or space to hide so the partial shade can give them a sense of security in the great outdoors.</p><h2>Outdoor Enclosures</h2><p>For cats who would prefer to ""free-roam"" (within limits), outdoor enclosures are ideal. They can be built from scratch, with your own or purchased plans, or assembled as modular enclosures. A free-roam set-up requires you to have a private outdoor space where you can construct a permanent structure. The advantages are that it gives cats total freedom to wander and explore within a safe space. It will require ongoing maintenance to ensure the structure remains sound and that no defects form over time that could cause injury or be a site where cats could escape.</p>",992
29,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-behavior-changes-554050,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Cat Behavior Changes That Might Mean Something's Wrong</h1>,"<h1>Cat Behavior Changes That Might Mean Something's Wrong</h1><h2>Atypical Behaviors Can Also Be Perfectly Normal</h2><p>When a cat's normal behavior changes subtly or dramatically, a conscientious owner can't help but feel concerned. Knowing what is ""normal"" for your cat will make it easier to recognize behavioral problems that arise. Some changes can indicate underlying health or social issues, while others are simply personality quirks that arise as your cat grows older. Learn the difference for both your cat's well-being and your peace of mind.</p><h2>Aggressive Behavior Changes</h2><p>Some cats have a stronger prey drive and will act out aggressively towards toys, children, other pets, or even their owners. This aggressive behavior is natural, but if a normally mellow cat suddenly starts acting aggressively, then this is a cause for concern.</p><p>Pain and fear are often the reasons for a cat to exhibit unprecedented-or unprovoked-aggression.</p><p>Resolving the aggressive behavior may mean finding and eliminating the cause of the pain or fear, using medications and behavior supplements, and reassuring your cat. Discipline is not the solution for aggressive behavior in cats.</p><h2>Eating Behavior Changes</h2><p>Cats are creatures of habit. They will quickly learn when it's meal time if you meal feed or that there is always food available if you elect to leave a bowl out.</p><h2>Playing Behavior Changes</h2><p>Some cats are naturally more playful than others and, just like people, they have individual personalities. But when a regularly playful cat doesn't want to play like it used to, it may be cause for concern. A cat that doesn't feel well or is in pain may not want to jump around and chase toys. A veterinary visit may be in order if your cat does not return to a normal playful cat after a couple of days.</p><h2>Hiding Behavior Changes</h2> <p>If the hiding is due to an event, then your cat should return to normal after a few days, If it is due to an illness or pain, the cat may need to be examined by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Elimination Behavior Changes</h2><p>One of the main reasons cats are relinquished, euthanized, or abandoned is the development of a urinary or fecal elimination problem. Behavior changes in the urination and defecation habits of your cat are most often related to stress, fear, or a lack of appropriate, clean, litter box options.</p><p>Some cats suddenly choose to defecate and/or urinate outside of their box, and this behavior is your cat trying to tell you something. They may not like the size of the box, the kind of litter, how dirty the litter is, the placement of the box, or the number of litter box options they have.</p><p>In some cases, cats may be trying to tell you that they don't feel well and that they have a urinary tract infection or pain from a digestive tract problem. If you notice abnormally large clumps of litter from urine, spots of blood in the litter box, absent or very small clumps of litter from urine, or your cat is straining, crying, or eliminating outside of the litter box, you should not hesitate to visit the veterinarian to address the potentially life-threatening infection.</p><p>Many other things can cause elimination behavior changes and even the experts do not fully understand all the reasons behind them. Medical reasons for elimination behavior changes should always be ruled out prior to fixing any environmental issues.</p><h2>Scratching Behavior Changes</h2><p>Scratching is a normal cat behavior, but if your cat suddenly starts scratching more, especially in one particular spot, it could be an indication that it is stressed. Nutritional supplements designed to relax your cat without sedating it, as well as pheromones, may help lower your cat's stress level.</p><p>Otherwise, think about any changes in the environment that may have negatively impacted your cat and do your best to correct them.</p><h2>Sleeping Behavior Changes</h2><p>Cats who are not feeling well may sleep more than usual. There is, of course, the simple possibility that your cat is just lazy and/or overweight, but if a cat starts sleeping more than it used to, you should schedule a visit to your veterinarian.</p><h2>Grooming Behavior Changes</h2><p>Grooming is a natural cat activity. They typically groom themselves and others when they are relaxed or feel as though their fur is messy. Cats that stop grooming or have a major decrease in self-grooming may be ill and should be checked out by a veterinarian.</p><p>Sometimes cats who are gaining weight are unable to reach certain areas of their body, therefore they are unable to groom themselves. This can be fixed by helping your cat to lose the extra weight with less food or a lower calorie diet.</p><p>Sore joints and muscles are also a contributing factor in grooming. Cats that have osteoarthritis or injuries may not be able to reach certain areas to groom that they were once able to reach.</p><h2>Vocalization Behavior Changes</h2><p>Cats have many vocalizations and reasons for making them.</p><p>Assess the situation and think about what changes could be causing the vocalizations. If you cannot think of any reasons for the sudden noises your cat is making, consider scheduling a visit with your veterinarian to see if there is a medical reason causing distress in your cat.</p><h2>When Is Cat Behavior an Emergency?</h2><p>Any change in a cat's behavior could be considered an emergency, so if you're unsure, promptly schedule a vet visit. Sudden reclusive behavior, lethargy, or aggression are possible indicators of pain or illness that should be diagnosed and treated as soon as possible.</p><p>Minor changes in behavior, or those that appear and pass quickly, are rarely cause for concern and can be chalked up to cat ""quirks.""</p>",912

Because reasons for both of these behaviors can be either physical or emotional, or both, you need to do some homework on possible causes.</p><p>Sometimes, what may seem to be a ""behavior problem"" may be completely normal behavior in a given cat. Weigh all the factors before deciding that your cat has a problem that needs to be corrected.</p><h2>""Lost in the Night"" Howling</h2><p>Although no one knows for sure why some cats do this, it is most common in geriatric cats, due to cognitive dysfunction (senility) and/or decreased vision or hearing. This kind of mournful calling, in cats of any age, when associated with suddenly racing around the house with the fur on the back rolling, can also be the result of another physical condition, , commonly known as rippling skin disorder. Other medical disorders that can cause excessive vocalization include hyperthyroidism, cancer, neurologic disease, and pain. For all of these conditions, veterinary intervention and treatment are indicated.</p><h2>Begging for Food and Treats</h2><p>Although genuine hunger can't be completely discounted, cats, like humans, do sometimes suffer from addiction. They can be quite pitiful in their efforts to feed their addiction, especially for treats such as bonita tuna flakes.</p><h3>Solution</h3><p>Occasional treats are not harmful, and for the overweight cat, using small, low calories treats can be a viable substitute when the cat begs for food, particularly treats of the high protein variety. Treats should not comprise more than 10% of your cat's daily calories. Several small meals a day is actually better for cats than one big meal in the morning or evening. Schedule three or four small meals of canned food, picking up the remainder after 20 to 30 minutes. If you need to feed dry food due to your cat's preference or your schedule, give one meal of dry food in the evening, which you can leave down for the night.</p><h2>Pawing Your Arm or Leg</h2><p>Some cats, like kids, do need frequent attention and will paw your arm when you are seated or do the ""figure 8"" around your legs as you try to walk.</p><h3>Solution</h3><p>Some cats simply need more human attention. If the cat is the only cat in the household, you may want to adopt another cat for company. Otherwise, try to schedule special times for playing, lap-cuddling, and petting for these cats. Cats like routine, and if they know that lap time is coming soon, chances are they'll leave you alone.</p><h2>Insistent Meowing</h2><p>Some cats are also very vocal (Siamese and Oriental breeds are famous for this trait). And many cats actually enjoy a back-and-forth feline-human chat and will meow right back at you when you talk (or meow) to them.</p><h3>Solution</h3><p>Enjoy it, if you do like to talk back to your cat. If you're not particularly crazy about a ""chatty cat,"" reserve your attention for times when it is quiet. On the other hand, if your cat is normally quiet and suddenly starts meowing insistently, (or if a normally talkative cat suddenly stops meowing) it could be trying to tell you it is in pain or discomfort. Or your cat could be gradually going deaf. A trip to the vet is indicated here, to rule out medical problems.</p><h2>Pica</h2><p>Although pica (the eating of non-food items) is not necessarily an attention-getting behavior, it certainly does gain the attention of us humans. Pica manifests also in wool-sucking or chewing, and is particularly dangerous if plastics or string-like objects are ingested. Wool sucking is common in certain breeds, including Siamese, Burmese, and Himalayans, and it is also common in cats prematurely weaned or removed from their mothers. Stress seems to be a common denominator in cats with pica.</p><h3>Solution</h3><p>Since stress is so common in cats with pica, it is important to either rule out stress or deal with it. Anxiety and stress can often be ameliorated by scheduling regular petting or play sessions in a quiet place and providing plenty of toys, vertical space, and other forms of environmental enrichment. In rare cases, anti-anxiety drugs may be indicated.</p><p>Pica can also be related to certain mineral deficiencies, so make sure your kitty's diet is well-balanced. It is also important to remove the inappropriate chewing/swallowing substances by picking up strings, small pieces of plastic, and rubber bands, or eliminate them as items of interest by cat-proofing electrical wiring with wrapping or bitter apple spray.</p><h2>Inappropriate Scratching</h2><p>Sometimes cats who have plenty of scratching poles and other ""legitimate"" scratching surfaces, still will insist on inappropriate scratching on carpeting or furniture. Cats sometimes use inappropriate scratching as communication.</p><h3>Solution</h3><p>Make sure to offer your cat a variety of scratching posts in different materials and shapes so they can find the one they like the most. You can also use treats and catnip to attract your cat to appropriate scratching posts.</p><h2>Rippling Skin Disorder</h2><p>This condition, also known as feline hyperesthesia, is not well understood. It can sometimes be successfully treated with dietary change, elimination of fleas or toxins (which might be a cause), medication, and/or planned exercise activities for the cat.</p><h2>Stress and Anxiety</h2> <p>In these cases, providing environmental enrichment for your cat is paramount.</p><p>Doing your homework, knowing your cat's normal behavior, and keeping close watch over behavioral changes, can go a long way toward helping your needy cat to eliminate attention-seeking behaviors.</p>",896

Cats scratch things to care for their claws, mark surfaces, invite play, or attract attention, Most prefer to scratch surfaces that they can sink their claws into, like carpet, drapery, and upholstery-much to the dismay of cat owners. It's important to stop your cat from scratching your carpet and other beloved possessions and direct the scratching to a better target so you can preserve your household furnishings (and your relationship with your cat).</p><h2>Why Cats Scratch Carpet, Upholstery, and Other Surfaces</h2><p>Cats scratch by digging their front claws into a horizontal or vertical surface, then pulling their feet down or back. While this often damages the item being scratched, it provides a benefit to the cat. Scratching is an important part of a cat's health and wellbeing. There are a few reasons why cats scratch, and it all comes down to instinct.</p><h2>Health and Grooming</h2><p>The action of scratching, referred to as, loosens and removes the outer layers of the claw to reveal a sharp new surface underneath. You may find these nail layers around your home, especially in areas where your cat likes to scratch. Claw sharpening is an act of grooming for the cat.</p><p>Scratching also exercises the muscles of the forelimbs and spine to keep the cat in top shape for hunting. Some cats will scratch by lying down and pulling their body weight along the floor. The surfaces they choose to scratch are usually fixed and nonyielding to provide resistance against the muscles they use to scratch.</p><h2>Communication</h2><p>Scratching is also used as a form of communication or marking behavior. The scent and sweat glands on the feet mix together and produce a unique smell. When claws are scraped down a surface, it leaves behind marks, scents, and claw husks. Other cats can see and smell this like a message.</p><p>Outdoor cats may leave evidence of scratching on trees, fence posts, sheds, and wooden gates. It's no coincidence that these are all areas that are highly visible to other outdoor cats. Such scratching is a territorial behavior used to communicate with other cats and mark boundaries.</p><p>Indoor cats tend to find similar surfaces indoors to serve their instinct to scratch, often targeting softwoods, carpets, and fabric-covered furnishings.</p><p>In some cases, scratching is a precursor to play, either with another cat in the home or with human companions. It may also be a bid for attention. If a cat is routinely shooed or chased away when it scratches furniture or carpeting, it may come to associate scratching with receiving attention.</p><h2>How to Stop a Cat From Scratching the Carpet</h2><p>Your first option for preventing damage from scratching is to direct your cat's behavior to an acceptable target. Kitty furniture such as scratching posts is designed for that exact purpose.</p><p>What do you do if your cat refuses to use the scratching post or sometimes chooses to ignore it in favor of your carpeting? The best solution is to provide scratching surfaces that are more desirable to your cat than your furnishings.</p><p>Add a horizontal scratching pad. Cats have their own individual scratching patterns and preferences. Those that scratch carpeting may be more inclined to scratch horizontally than use a vertical scratching post. Fortunately, there are scratching pads made for horizontal scratching; some are wedge-shaped inclines and others are flattened out. Experiment to find one that your cat likes.</p><p>Add multiple scratching posts and pads, covered with different materials and different textures. It's possible that the choice of different scratching options will relieve your cat of its need to sharpen its claws on your carpet. Many scratching posts are covered with carpet, but you should add one or two with a different material, such as sisal, corrugated cardboard, or even plain wood. Remember that cats like varying surface angles for scratching, ranging between horizontal and vertical. So ideally, provide at least one of each: a tall vertical scratching post, a flat scratching mat, and an inclined scratcher. Make sure scratching posts are heavy and sturdy so they remain fixed in place while your cat scratches them.</p><p>Cover up the spot where your cat scratches. If possible, move a piece of furniture (or a scratching post) to your cat's favorite carpet spot. A sisal scratching post may be a good choice here. For scratching that takes place in front of an entryway, cover the area with a thin mat. Two-sided tape can act as a deterrent and eventually train your cat to avoid the area, especially on vertical surfaces.</p><p>Infuse the area with scent. Use a feline pheromone plug-in or a spray like Feliway in the area where your cat has been scratching. Although these types of products aren't marketed specifically for this purpose, cat behaviorists have found that the ""friendly pheromones"" in these products can fool cats into believing the area has already been ""marked"" by another cat, often discouraging scratching behavior.</p><p>Consider your cat's anxiety level. A cat may resort to more frequent scratching if it's emotionally stressed, such as when it feels threatened by environmental changes or a new pet (or a new child) has recently become a part of the household. Paying more attention to your cat, including playing with it more often, may offer the reassurance it needs to give up its carpet-scratching habits.</p><h2>Reduce the Damage Done by Cat Claws</h2><p>While you're working on methods to stop your cat's carpet scratching, you'll want to minimize the damage to your home in the meantime. Trim your cat's claws regularly, using a sharp claw-trimming tool. This will help keep the damage to a minimum.</p><p>You may also wish to try a product like nail caps. These should only be applied to cats that allow you to handle and manipulate their paws. If you've never used nail caps before, many veterinarians and most large pet supply stores offer installation and training for a small fee. Your cat probably won't mind them, and they'll prevent the shredding-type of damage your cat sometimes inflicts on your rugs.</p>",1004
32,https://www.thesprucepets.com/crazy-cat-554821,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Reasons Why Your Cat Acts Crazy and How to Stop It</h1>,"<h1>Reasons Why Your Cat Acts Crazy and How to Stop It</h1><p>A cat acting crazy may run around the house or get a nightly burst of energy, complete with a chorus of meows. A ""crazy"" cat can be entertaining to watch, but the behavior could veer into destructiveness, with the cat inadvertently knocking things over, and an increased likelihood that someone gets bitten. The cat may just be embracing its nocturnal or predatory instinct, in which case there are things you can do to support it and minimize the risk of chaos or bodily harm, or the wild behavior could also be a sign that something is wrong with their health.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Act Crazy?</h2><p>No matter the breed, all cats have moments when they run across a room, meow like crazy, and act as if they're on a racetrack being chased. They dart about, faster and faster, looking all over the place and then suddenly stop in their tracks.</p><p>This wild behavior is sometimes referred to as the ""midnight crazies"" when it happens at night. Your cat may entertain itself with wild activity or jump on your bed to paw at your feet, elbows, hair, or face to get you to join in the fun. The reasons for this wild and sometimes-amusing behavior vary.</p><h2>Predatory Instinct</h2><p>Cats are natural predators, and domestic cats retain this instinct to a certain extent. At times, a cat that's acting crazy may actually be exhibiting hunting behaviors, fighting maneuvers, or escape techniques.</p><p>A house cat that doesn't have to hunt for its food still needs to burn its pent-up energy, and it may be in the form of what appears to be crazy behavior. Toys, such as catnip mice, laser pointers, food puzzles, and feather wands encourage a cat to use its natural instincts to grab, chase, and jump. This exercise is especially important for your cat if it doesn't spend time outdoors.</p><h2>Nocturnal Instinct</h2><p>Another reason for your cat 's crazy behavior could be because some cats are nocturnal and become more active at night. If a cat isn't getting enough exercise during the day, it may act especially crazy.</p><p>Many domestic cats spend their days alone indoors while their people are at work. When the cat's person comes home in the evening, the cat may be very active and want to play. If it has no outlet for all this energy, the cat may exhibit some crazy behavior. Kittens are especially energetic.</p><h2>Senility</h2><p>If you have an older cat, it's possible it's acting crazy because of some cognitive dysfunction or senility. As a pet ages, its brain may start functioning differently and cause it to exhibit strange behavior for no apparent reason.</p><h2>Fleas</h2><p>Sometimes a cat acts crazy and looks as if something is biting it sporadically because it has fleas. Particularly when meowing is involved, your cat could be hypersensitive to flea bites or simply have an itch in a place it can't reach.</p><p>If you suspect your cat has fleas, treat all the furry animals in the household with a prescription product specifically for cats, designed to kill and prevent fleas. You should also see your vet to determine if there are any secondary skin infections of allergies from the fleas that need to be treated. You'll also need to treat the environment by vacuuming, doing laundry, and using area sprays or flea bombs if recommended by your vet. Once the fleas are gone, your cat should stop this behavior.</p><h2>Feline Hyperesthesia Syndrome (FHS)</h2><p>Feline hyperesthesia syndrome (FHS) is a rare reason why a cat may act crazy, although it affects mature cats most often and the cause is unknown.</p> <h2>Next Steps</h2><p>Sometimes it's difficult to know exactly what caused your cat to go a little wild all of a sudden. Frankly, cats are hard to interpret! Many people understand basic dog vocalizations and behaviors but don't recognize basic cat behaviors.</p><p>Dogs have expressive faces and body language that's pretty easy to accurately interpret. They wag their tails, make different noises to alert others of their moods, and often follow basic commands to please their people. Cats, on the other hand, are usually known more for their emotional vagueness and standoffish behavior. There is, however, a growing belief that cats are just as expressive as dogs. The problem is that people simply misunderstand or don 't see what or how their cats are trying to communicate.</p><h2>Learn to Read Your Cat</h2><p>When it comes to cats, meows and tail waves can mean a number of different things, depending on the situation. With each purr, yowl, or even blink, your feline is actually trying to communicate with you. The problem is figuring out what it's saying.</p><p>Experts say there 's something to gain from these attempts at communication. For instance, learning to read your cat's body language can strengthen your bond with it and allow you to become more effective at responding appropriately to its needs.</p><p>Every cat is different, so the best thing you can do to start is to simply observe your cat. Take mental notes of the environment and conditions present when the ""crazy"" behavior occurs. Pay attention to body language, vocalizations, time of day, and what your cat just did. Did your kitty just eat, groom, or scratch its back? Was there a playful meow before your cat dashed into the other room?</p><p>With time and careful observation, you'll likely begin to piece together the triggers of your cat's craziness in various situations. This will help you to understand what's normal for your cat and when any unusual behavior could be a symptom of a medical issue worth investigating with your vet.</p>",922
33,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-does-my-cat-bite-when-i-pet-her-553854,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Stop Petting Aggression in Cats</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Petting Aggression in Cats</h1><p>Cat lovers frequently ask for help in stopping aggressive behavior in their cats but there are many kinds of aggression, and a one-size-fits-all program doesn't work.</p><p>Of the several types of cat aggression, none confuses, frustrates, and frightens most owners as much as petting aggression, also called . The cat begs for attention and loves the petting, but then bites you after only a few strokes.</p><p>These cats use the ""leave me alone"" bite to stop interactions such as petting, being lifted or approached, or being moved from a favorite perch. It's a very common behavior in cats, but you can work with your pet to stop it.</p><h2>Why Is Your Cat Aggressive During Petting?</h2><p>Unlike dogs, cats often have a low tolerance for being petted and can become overstimulated quickly. The length of time it takes for petting to go from enjoyable to uncomfortable varies by cat. But when it reaches that point, the cat reacts almost as if it's being hurt or is in pain. Animal behaviorists refer to this as .</p><p>Petting aggression seems most common in young, energetic cats taken early from their litter and left alone for long periods during the day.</p><p>Smacking the cat may make the aggression worse since most cats view physical correction as a challenge and may become even more aggressive during subsequent petting sessions.</p><p>Petting aggression can be explosive and dangerous, especially for well-meaning young children. Learn to identify and avoid situations that might lead to this behavior.</p><h2>Rule out Medical Causes</h2><p>There are some medical conditions that may cause a cat to become aggressive, and you should rule these out before you try to modify your pet's behavior. Have your veterinarian check for signs of arthritis, an injury, or dental problems to make sure it's not any physical pain that's causing your cat to aggressively reject your petting.</p><h2>Common Signs</h2><p>Cat communication varies somewhat among cats, just as human speech may include different accents or colloquialisms.</p><h2>Prevention</h2><p>As long as biting and scratching work, your cat will continue to use them to control interaction. Make these behaviors unnecessary by avoiding situations that prompt them, and/or manage the circumstances so the cat never gets a chance to bite or wield its claws.</p><p>Be consistent, though, and practice tough love. If you give up before you've established the ground rules for petting and aggression, you may have to start the conditioning from square one.</p><p>And remember, a pet's bad habits often become worse just before they go away as your cat tries harder to get the previously successful behavior to work again. Behaviorists call this an , and when it happens, it means you're on the right track.</p><h2>Petting Threshold</h2><p>Cats accept grooming from other cats on the head and neck. But the full-body strokes a human applies may feel unacceptable and make the cat uneasy or uncomfortable. It's this feeling of unease that stimulates the biting.</p><p>Limit your petting to the cat's head or the back of its neck. Then identify its petting threshold. In other words, count the number of strokes your cat allows before aggressing; pay close attention to its body language so you can stop petting before the cat bites.</p><p>It may be three strokes, five, or more. Once you've identified its limit, stop before the cat attacks so that control the interaction. This is the key to reversing this behavior: letting the cat know you're in charge of the situation.</p><p>When you reach the petting threshold, if the cat is sitting on your lap, don't push it off or it may claw at you in an attempt to attack your hands. To end the petting, simply stand up and dump the cat off without touching it. Don't interact with the cat, who may cry to get your attention. Other cats in this situation may simply run away and sulk.</p><h2>Use Positive Reinforcement</h2><p>The goal in these situations is to teach the cat that all good things in life (play, food, attention) must be earned and that you call the shots. Then rewards and resources can be used to motivate the cat to properly respond.</p><p>For instance, teach the cat to ""come"" by using dinnertime to your advantage.</p><p>Before the cat gets the food bowl, say ""come"" in a cheerful, strong voice and then turn on the can opener, shake the bag of kibble, or pick up the treat jar. Your cat has already learned these cues and what time to run to its bowl, so you just teach it to associate the come command with the action. When the cat obeys, reward it with the treat or bowl of food.</p><p>You can also clicker train your cat by pairing food rewards with a clicker that makes a noise. Eventually, your cat will begin to think of the clicker as the reward and treats may no longer be necessary.</p><p>Use a treat or toy to lure your kitty off furniture or out of the way instead of pushing or lifting it, which puts your hands within the strike zone. Say ""move"" and toss the treat on the floor or entice the cat down with a feather.</p><p>If the cat is in your chair, tip or shake it to get the cat to leave on its own. Eventually, you'll just need to say the word and offer a sweeping gesture for the cat to obey and you've avoided an encounter that could otherwise lead to a bite.</p><h2>Desensitization</h2><p>Finally, if you like, you can desensitize the cat and improve its petting tolerance. If it allows three strokes before its ears and tail signal distress, add one more stroke, paired with a reward such as a clicker; then stop and dump the cat off your lap before it can bite. By adding one stroke each week, over time you can increase its threshold while avoiding its teeth.</p>",953

Several common kitty behaviors are seen as undesirable and can affect the quality of life for both owners and their pets. Fortunately, many of these behaviors can be corrected.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Have Behavior Problems?</h2><p>Cats tend to be mysterious, so discovering the cause of certain feline behaviors can be a challenge. To further complicate things, there's not necessarily one single reason behind a particular behavior, and every cat has a distinct personality.</p><h2>Vocalization</h2><p>You've finally fallen asleep when suddenly you hear your cat howling and crying at the top of its lungs outside your bedroom door. This happens all the time with cats, and this behavior may be completely normal for your kitty. After all, cats are nocturnal, like their wild relatives, so they may be more active at night while you're trying to sleep, though it may also be a sign that something's wrong.</p><h2>Scratching</h2><p>Cats scratch to mark their territory. If your cat is scratching objects that you prefer it wouldn't, you can redirect the behavior by providing scratching posts and other toys your kitty can dig its claws into.</p><h2>Chewing</h2><p>Cats are not known to be the voracious chewers that dogs can be. Yet some still manage to do quite a bit of damage with their teeth. Chewing behavior in your cat may be caused by boredom, aggression, a nutritional deficiency,teething in kittens, or having been weaned too young. It might also simply be because your cat is playing or likes the texture or taste of the item.</p><h2>Urinary Problems</h2><p>Cats can have a variety of urinary issues. Infections, inflammation, bladder stones, stress, tumors, and other factors can cause a catto urinate outside its box, spray,or be unable to urinate. Conflicts between cats or other pets and changes in the house (e.g., construction, family members leaving, new family members arriving) can stress cats and lead to litter box issues as well.</p><h2>Aggression</h2><p>Cats may become aggressive toward other pets and people, and it's a major behavioral problem. The aggression can be caused by stress and anxiety or by a medical problem that causes pain or hormonal changes in a cat.</p><h2>Obsessive-Compulsive Licking</h2><p>Chronic licking in cats typically stems from pain or stress and anxiety. While all cats lick themselves, excessive licking may be serious and should be addressed without delay.</p><p>A cat that's in painmay lick an area on its body until it's hairless and raw and it isn't always in the area that's causing pain. A stressed or anxious cat may lick its belly until it has no fur or obsessively overgroom other parts of its body.</p><h2>How to Stop Behavior Problems</h2><p>Some behavioral issues stem from a cat's instincts, but it's best to begin by ruling out medical problems with your vet. If you suspect your cat is ill or in pain, seek veterinary care. Discuss supplements, medications, pheromones, special diets, and other things that are designed to help older cats or curb excessive licking.</p><p>After that, you can start to address and discourage certain behaviors such as jumping on counters or help your cat overcome whatever issue is the cause.</p><h2>Excessive Vocalizations</h2><p>Providing your cat with something to keep it busy while you sleep may help prevent night howling. You could also provide more exercise during the day so it's less active at night.</p><p>Your cat may howl when it wants food, to go outside, or to be petted. The response you give your cat (e.g., giving in to its demand for a treat) will train it to continue to make these vocalizations to get what it wants.</p><h2>Unwanted Scratching</h2><p>Entice your cat to use a scratching post by sprinkling catnip on it and placing it in front of the items you don't want it to scratch. Some cats like certain fabrics and materials more than others, so you might need to try scratching posts that offer various textures. If your cat doesn't like its current post, try one made with carpeting, rope, or corrugated cardboard.</p><p>Aside from scratching posts, you can use pheromones and nail caps on an ongoing basis. Nail caps are small plastic nail coverings that are glued over your cat's nails to protect your furniture. Pheromones are available as sprays, wipes, and diffusers to help calm your cat and discourage any scratching behavior that's due to stress or anxiety.</p><p>Declawing which is actually an amputation is a controversial subject but is also sometimes performed to prevent cats from scratching furniture. This nonreversible surgery should be researched thoroughly and discussed with your vet.</p><h2>Problem Chewing</h2> <h2>Litter Box Issues</h2><p>If you spot your cat straining or unable to urinate, it needs immediate veterinary care. Special litter, diets, pheromones, supplements, and medications can all help with urinary behavioral problems in your cat. When medical reasons have been ruled out, then it's oftentimes a behavioral problem that needs to be addressed.</p><h2>Aggressive Behavior</h2><p>Observe your cat for any triggers that cause it to be aggressive. If you can figure out what the trigger is and get rid of it, this is the easiest way to deal with aggressive behavior.</p><p>Quite often, your cat may have to learn to live with the trigger. Again, pheromones, supplements, medications, and special diets may help. You can also give your cat other things to focus its energy on, like exercise-inducing toys. Try other simple solutions, such as setting up dividers between food bowls and litter boxes.</p><p>Černá P, Gardiner H, Sordo L, Tørnqvist-Johnsen C, Gunn-Moore DA.

35,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-reasons-why-cats-slap-each-other-5208741,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>4 Reasons Why Cats Slap Each Other</h1>,"<h1>4 Reasons Why Cats Slap Each Other</h1><p>For a long time cats have held a reputation of being solitary and while they certainly aren't as social and gregarious as dogs are, cats can live in the same home and do well together. They can even become bonded to one another. One behavior you may see from time to time if you live in a multicat home is one cat slapping another cat. Why do cats do this? Are they fighting with one another? Or is something else going on?</p><h2>Why Do Cats Slap Each Other?</h2><p>A cat may slap another cat for a multitude of reasons. The trick to determining why your cats are slapping each other is to look at the rest of the body language and behavior of your cats. Cats slapping one another is a normal behavior for them, even if some of the reasons for it are less desirable.</p><h3>Initiating Playtime</h3><p>Playful, energetic cats may slap each other as in invitation to play. Cats that are inviting play by slapping will have body language fitting a playful cat. Their whiskers will be forward and their attention given to the situation at hand. Their claws will be retracted for the slap so as not to hurt the other cat. There will be no yowling, screaming, or hissing from the cat that's doing the slapping. All of these nonverbal cues indicate to the other cat that the slapper wants to play.</p><h3>Predatory Instincts</h3><p>Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require animal protein in their diet. This means they are also tiny little predators and, as such, they have a high prey drive. In fact, a lot of toys on the market actually tap into this. Feather wands, jingle balls, and laser pointers all exploit your cat's predatory instincts. Cats that don't have an appropriate outlet for these instincts may start to act out by pouncing on their housemates, or you. If your cat slaps another cat with all the hallmarks of playful body language but you feel they are still a little too exuberant about the slapping, they may be doing because of a pent-up instinct to hunt.</p><h3>Illness and Pain</h3><p>If a cat isn't feeling well or if they are experiencing pain, they may slap other cats to get them to stay away. Cats suffering from chronic pain or chronic illness tend to be more guarded with other pets in the home.</p><p>They could be fearful of other pets accidentally hurting them. Cats don't necessarily show arthritic changes outwardly like dogs do. In fact, a study showed that 61% of cats over the age of 6 years had arthritic changes that could be seen in at least one joint on x-ray and 48% had changes in multiple joints.</p><p>It's important to note that the arthritis in these cats were diagnosed not by changes the owners had noted, but by x-rays. An older cat that has seemingly normal activity at home may be harboring arthritic pain. This could explain why a cat seems to get crankier with age; they could be in pain.</p><h2>How to Stop Cats From Slapping Each Other</h2><p>Even though cats slapping one another is considered to be a normal behavior, that doesn't mean it's desirable for your cats to be slapping each other. There are ways you can minimize the incidence of cats slapping one another.</p><p>If your cats are slapping each other because of play and instinct, instilling scheduled and structured play times can help. A cat that has the same scheduled twenty minutes every day to hunt and pounce on its favorite wand toy or chase the elusive red dot may be less likely to slap its housemates for play. It's important to remember that part of the fun of the hunt is catching the prey at the end. Laser pointers don't allow for this, so if your cat loves playing with them, end each play session with tossing them a kicker toy that that can jump on and bunny kick to 'kill'.</p><p>Keeping your cat up-to-date on its annual exams can help ensure there aren't any illnesses brewing that may be causing pain or discomfort. Cats tend to be nervous at the vet, and it can be difficult for your vet to accurately assess them to see if there are subtle signs of arthritis. Get a video on your phone of your cat walking around or jumping up on things; this can be a great help for your vet to determine if your cat has early arthritis. As your cat ages, consider starting them on a joint supplement. Your vet can recommend the best product for your cat.</p><p>Intercat aggression isn't always a quick-and-easy fix, but there are some things you can do to make home life less stressful for your cat. Ensuring there are an adequate number of litter boxes is a great start. Most behavior experts recommend the number of litter boxes in your home equals the number of cats you have, plus one. So, if you have two cats, you'd ideally have three litter boxes.</p><p>Experts also recommend that litter boxes be on every level of your home and not all clumped together on one floor or in one location. You can also minimize intercat aggression by increasing the number of vertical spaces in your home. Cat shelves and cat trees, especially in high traffic areas such as hallways, can relieve the stress of living in tight quarters while also giving cats a more appropriate outlet for their stress.</p>",904

Chin biting is definitely one of these. Truly, though, most chin bites can be more accurately described as mouthing as they rarely break the skin.</p><p>It can be alarming, though, if you are enjoying a snuggle session with your cat and they, seemingly out of the blue, start to nibble on your chin.</p><h2>Reasons Why Your Cat Might Be Biting Your Chin</h2><p>Although some cats may nibble on their owner's chins as a sign of play or affection, it can also sometimes be a sign that they are stressed or need space. Observing the subtleties of your cat's body language and behaviors can help you understand if it is something you need to be worrying about.</p><h3>Petting-Induced Aggression</h3><p>Petting-induced aggression is an interesting behavior in which a cat, who is seemingly enjoying his/her pets, suddenly lashes out with a swat or bite. Oftentimes, although it may seem like this swat or bite comes out of nowhere, there are actually subtle signs that your cat is reaching their petting limit that you might not have spotted.</p><p>Not all cats 'enjoy' being petted in the first place. The follicles in your cat's fur can be sensitive, and excessive petting can become irritating or even painful for them.</p><h3>A Sign of Affection</h3><p>Most people know that purring and kneading (or 'making biscuits') are both signs of a happy, content cat. These aren't the only behaviors your cat will exhibit if they love you, though.</p><p>Cats will groom one another as a sign of affection. This is a behavior known as allogrooming and can include licking and biting. If your cat starts to nibble on your chin, especially if it is preceded with a few licks, it could just be an episode of allogrooming.</p><h3>Boredom or Over-stimulation</h3><p>If you have been playing with your cat, they may start to nibble on your chin if they get a little too carried away. It may not be a sign of aggression, but it isn't a good idea to encourage this rough type of behavior if your cat is over-aroused.</p><p>For other cats, they may be feeling bored and this type of bitey play may be a way to stay entertained.</p><h3>A Sign of Stress or Illness</h3><p>If your cat is feeling stressed or unwell, it may be more prone to showing signs of aggression, including biting. They may want you to give them more space if you are crowding them or they are in pain.</p><p>In rare cases, a cat may even have a condition known as hyperesthesia, where they are extremely sensitive to touch. Cats with hyperesthesia have follicles that are even more sensitive than normal. You may notice your cat's skin crawl as you pet them along their back if they are overly sensitive to the sensation of being pet.</p><h2>What To Do If Your Cat Bites Your Chin</h2><p>If your cat is just being affectionate and the biting is gentle, then you may be happy to let them display their love for you in this way. If it is sore, aggressive, or just too much then there are a number of aspects to consider.</p><h3>Don't Punish Your Cat</h3><p>The biggest thing to remember when your cat bites your chin is to punish them by yelling, swatting, etc. If your cat bites you from petting-induced aggression or stress this will only exacerbate the issue. If your cat bites you because they just love you so much they may get confused if they are then punished for their quirky way of showing their affection.</p><h3>Give Your Cat the Space They Need</h3><p>Learn to read your cat's body language and other signals that they might be giving you to tell you they don't want to be petted.</p><p>Unlike in dogs, a tail that is swishing quickly or harshly back and forth is not a sign of happiness in cats. It can actually be a sign of anger, frustration, and even overstimulation. Your cat may also go from having a nice, relaxed, slow-blink face to a tense face and may even turn their head to watch your hand as you pet them. These are all ways your cat is telling you, 'I would like you to stop petting me now'.</p><h3>Provide Options for Redirection and Alternative Enrichment</h3><p>Providing toys for your cat to play with can allow them to more appropriately burn off all their excitement if they are prone to overstimulation. Puzzle feeders, whether homemade or purchased from a pet supply store, can provide your cat with plenty of mental stimulation and enrichment.</p><p>Some DIY options include encouraging your cat to forage kibble or treats out of a cup, ice cube tray, or folded over toilet paper tube. Wand and feather toys and paper bags with catnip inside give your cat an appropriate outlet for their predatory instincts.</p><p>Also, if they are biting because they are overstimulated, try not to instinctively jerk back. Your amped-up cat may see this sudden and quick movement as an invitation for more play!</p><h3>Ensure There is No Underlying Behavioral or Medical Condition</h3><p>If your cat is normally seeking out affection and now noticeably withdraws or shows signs of aggression when you try to pet them, this could be a sign that they are feeling unwell. Keep an eye out for any other signs of illness and seek advice from your vet if the problem persists.</p><p>If your cat is exhibiting signs of stress, they may be needing more help to make them feel comfortable in their own environment. Apart from giving them the space they need, think about whether there have been other changes in their environment or routine that could have contributed to this.</p>",936

Many animal lovers who find themselves in contact with a feral cat wonder if they can be domesticated, trained, and ultimately welcomed into their home as a pet, particularly if you 've discovered a cat living outdoors in either cold weather, or a heavily trafficked and/or potentially unsafe environment.</p><p>The good news is that, yes, feral cats can become your new live-in feline friend. But there are several very important steps that must be taken first, as domesticating a feral cat is certainly not a task for the faint of heart and will require an enormous amount of time and patience.</p><h2>What to Do If You Find a Feral Cat</h2><p>Whether it found its way into your yard or you frequently spot a particular homeless cat lurking around your neighborhood, if you somehow find yourself in the company of a feral cat, there are some steps you can take to ensure both your safety, as well as the kitty 's. Keep in mind that because these cats have never had the pleasure of bonding with a human in any meaningful way, they often consider all people as large predators and are generally not afraid to act accordingly by biting, hissing, or even scratching or otherwise attacking you.</p><p>You should also never approach a cat that seems sick, even though you likely want to do everything in your power to help the poor kitty. If a feral cat has randomly shown up at your back door, there 's a decent chance he or she has rabies, and it 's far safer to call local animal control and avoid the risk of being bitten or scratched and requiring medical attention.</p><p>Above all, it 's important that anyone who considers taming a feral cat should know that it will likely take several weeks-or even longer, if you 've found a particularly skittish kitty-so patience is of utmost importance.</p><h2>How to Tame a Feral Cat</h2><p>There are several factors that will determine your ability to tame a feral cat, including the age and personality of the cat, as well as the kinds of experiences the cat has had on the street (as well as previous encounters they 've had with other humans).</p><p>But there is one thing we humans have in our arsenal that will greatly increase your chances at training a feral cat-and that 's food. It 's widely understood that wild cats became domesticated in the first place because they became content with the idea of having access to regular meals, so if you 're thinking about taming a feral cat in your neighborhood, you 'll want to begin by establishing some sort of routine around food. For example, be sure to offer some cat food to the cat at the same time and in the same place every day, perhaps in a certain area on your porch or patio.</p><p>However, try not to make eye contact when you spot the cat (like dogs, eye contact can be perceived as a threat). Instead, remain still and quiet and either sit or stand quietly in the general vicinity while the kitty eats. After a few days, you can build up to speaking to your cat in a calm and reassuring voice.</p><p>If it seems like the cat is letting down its guard and beginning to trust you, try moving the food a little bit closer to you each day. You can also try offering a few special treats along with the meal. It 's important to keep in mind that you won 't want to touch the cat until you 're very confident that he or she will allow it. When you're ready to give it a go, try reaching out to pet the cat without making any sudden movements. If the cat backs away from your touch, give it a few days before trying again. Also, try letting the cat sniff your finger or the back of your cupped palm (with fingers bent inward to face yourself) beforehand. Eventually, you can gradually progress to petting the cat and even gently picking it up. However, remember to always wash your hands and arms thoroughly after handling any feral animals.</p><h2>Safety and Other Considerations When Bringing Home a Feral Cat</h2><p>While the next step may seem like you can finally open your door to your new feline friend, you 'll want to avoid bringing it inside, particularly if you have other pets (or children). Instead, take the cat to the veterinarian to have a full checkup, vaccinations, as well as to be spayed or neutered (this will, of course, require the cat trusting you enough to put it into a crate for the trip). This step may take several attempts, but it 's absolutely essential for your health and safety, as well as for your new cat 's.</p><p>If you have the all-clear from your vet and you're ready to welcome your new kitty home, you'll want to start with a special quiet, somewhat secluded space that's set aside just for the cat. Consider furnishing your cat's new living area with some cat trees and towers and scratching posts, as well as places to hide and sleep. And, of course, don't forget the basics like a cat food and water bowl and a litter box. Fortunately, even cats who have spent their entire lives outdoors can generally grasp the concept pretty quickly.</p><p>Be sure to keep your interactions brief, until your new cat seems comfortable with its new surroundings. In time, your new cat should forget their days on the street and be more than content to relax and play at home with their new family.</p>",965
38,https://www.thesprucepets.com/aggression-towards-people-551796,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Stop Cats From Biting and Scratching</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Cats From Biting and Scratching</h1><h2>Cats may need to be retrained from behaviors they learned as kittens</h2><p>There are several basic kinds of aggression based biting and scratching behaviors in cats, and some of them are traceable to behavior they learned from their owners or interactions with their owners. Kittens learn to bite and scratch as a normal part of development, and if not trained early, will not know when using their claws and teeth is not appropriate.</p><h2>Establish Boundaries</h2><p>One of the first rules for human companions is: don't teach your cat that hands are toys. This is a behavior that you must develop and correct when they are young kittens. If you ignore this advice, those tiny claws and teeth will soon grow into razor-sharp ""meat hooks,"" and you'll bear the scars. Do not use your hands as toys and rough house with them as they will not likely hurt you when they are kittens, but once fully developed they will think they can still play this way despite having larger and stronger jaws and claws. Hands should only be used for petting and carrying. It should be established early that any ""mouthing"" is painful to you, even when it may not be painful. Once this is established, you will need to direct playful behavior onto other objects.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Bite and Scratch?</h2><p>Aggressive biting often happens during a petting session, when the human companion either doesn't understand or ignores the cat's body language. While some cats love to be petted for hours on end, sometimes a cat becomes overstimulated for one reason or another and want to opt out of the petting session, but don't know how to tell you when to stop.</p><p>An annoyed cat signals its feelings with narrowed eyes and ears pulled back. If you wait for the inevitable tail lashing, you've waited too long, and you may be rewarded with a bite. The rule here is to watch the cat's signals and stop whatever you're doing to prevent an escalation. Once you know what your cat's triggers are for aggression you can limit these interactions or prevent them entirely. For some cats the trigger may be petting them on the belly, petting them for too long, or being too ruff when petting them near the base of the tail. Learn what your cat enjoys and doesn't and follow their lead when petting them.</p><h2>Other Animals</h2><p>Your cat may become upset at seeing a strange cat through a window and react by attacking the first thing it sees in the immediate vicinity-either you or another cat-a classic case of redirected aggression. This kind of behavior will require creative thinking on your part.</p><p>First, remove your cat to an area where it can't see the strange cat. Next, reassure your cat; spend extra time carefully petting and playing with it. Give your cat extra treats when it's able to interact calmly. In extreme cases, your veterinarian may prescribe medication to help your cat feel less anxious. If you know who owns the cat, you may also politely ask your neighbors, to keep the animal indoors to prevent the episodes of redirected aggression.</p><h2>Medical Causes</h2><p>When new and unusual behavior problems arise in your cat, including aggressive biting and scratching, it could be a sign of an underlying illness. Medical causes range from undetected wounds, to distress from mites or fleas, to a hormonal imbalance such as hyperthyroidism.</p><p>If an otherwise docile cat exhibits sudden and unexplained aggressiveness toward you, especially when being handled, a visit to your veterinarian is in order. They will likely look for sources of pain or discomfort as well as recommending bloodwork.</p><h2>Hyperesthesia</h2><p>Hyperesthesia is a rare condition that is a seen in bursts of exaggerated and repetitive grooming or aggressive behavior in some cats. This condition first shows up in cats around a year old and is prevalent among Siamese, Burmese, and Abyssinian cats. Among the symptoms of hyperesthesia are excessive grooming and self-mutilation, unexplained and sudden aggression, and in extreme cases, seizures.</p><p>Although there's some debate about what causes it, some veterinarians believe hyperesthesia is a neurological condition similar to panic attacks in humans, some experts believe the attacks are triggered by stress, and others associate it with a type of seizure disorder. In any event, a cat with sudden aggressive behavior (such as biting) who experiences seizures should receive a neurological exam from a veterinarian or a veterinary specialist.</p><p>To prevent or stop episodes of hyperesthesia once they've started, dropping a towel or blanket over the cat can help contain it or disrupt it. In some instances, your vet may prescribe antianxiety or antiseizure medication to help curb the seizures and other behaviors.</p><h2>How to Stop Biting and Scratching</h2><p>Sometimes if a cat is in the habit of biting and scratching, it's difficult to train it out of this behavior. It will take patience and time, but you can teach your cat that you prefer not to be the target of its attacks, even if the cat views it as playtime.</p><h2>If Your Cat Is Still Biting</h2><p>Make an appointment with your veterinarian. They will likely have many questions to ask about the type of behavior, circumstances of the behavior, the household environment, and your technique in correcting them. In some cases they will ask to run bloodwork for specific conditions that can cause elevated aggression. If they can't help eliminate the behavior they may refer you a behavior specialist.</p>",895
39,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cats-chewing-plastic-553932,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Why Cats Eat and Chew on Plastic</h1>,"<h1>Why Cats Eat and Chew on Plastic</h1><p>Some cats are a lot like puppies and enjoy chewing on objects. Plastic items are some of those objects that many cats take a liking to, but why? And is it dangerous if a cat chews on or eats plastic?</p><h2>Normal Cat Chewing Behaviors</h2><p>Cats that are teething are more likely to chew on items than adult cats and this is completely normal. Kittens lose their baby teeth and grow a full set of adult teeth between 3.5 and 7 months of age. Different teeth will fall out at different times, but the drive to chew may be stronger during these 4 months while your kitten attempts to get relief from the 30 new teeth that are coming in.</p><p>Kittens love to play with small objects and sometimes they grab these objects, such as bottle caps, bottle nipples, or rubber bands, and put them in their mouths. Once they feel the texture of the items, they often continue the behavior and seek out items with a similar texture.</p><p>Adult cats may take a liking to chewing on certain textures. The attraction to a specific item may have started after it was covered or filled with catnip, treats, or another tasty edible, or it may have blossomed out of pure curiosity. Some cats are more adventurous than others and may lick or bite items to see what happens and when the item makes a fun noise or has an interesting taste, they continue.</p><p>Adult cats may also start chewing on plastic if they experience dental pain in an attempt to soothe their hurting mouth. If you suspect your cat has dental disease or discomfort, be sure to get it examined by your veterinarian.</p><h2>Abnormal Cat Chewing Behaviors</h2><p>Pica is a term used to describe an eating disorder where items of no nutritional value are consumed like litter or dirt. Since plastic has no nutritional value, you could argue that a cat that chews and then consumes plastic has pica. Most cats that lick or chew plastic, though, start doing so because the object tasted good or they enjoyed playing with it, not because they have an eating disorder. But stress may cause a cat to do irrational things and therefore develop pica as a response to being stressed. Cats may also turn to this behavior out of boredom.</p><p>Cats that have aggression issues may begin chewing on plastic cords and other items around the house in an attempt to express their emotions. These aggressive behaviors can be a sign of pain, poor socialization, and stress, among other things.</p><h2>Problems With Chewing Plastic</h2><p>Your cat may chew on some plastic items without an issue, but many items pose a potential danger to your feline friend. Plastic items that are small enough for your cat to fit completely in its mouth pose a swallowing or choking hazard. They could also cause injury to the teeth and gums.</p><p>Plastic items can cause gastrointestinal obstructions and prevent food and water from passing through the body or puncture or tear the stomach or intestines if the item has sharp edges or corners. If your cat consumes plastic, it will need to be removed. Sometimes your veterinarian will recommend making your cat vomit the item up, but this is not the case for all plastic items, and inducing vomiting is not always successful in cats. If there is concern for gastrointestinal obstruction or damage, surgery or endoscopy to remove the item from your cat should be performed by your veterinarian. These procedures require general anesthesia and are not without their risks, so it is always best to prevent your cat from eating plastic in the first place.</p><h2>Preventing Your Cat From Chewing Plastic</h2><p>Stress and anxiety can be lessened and sometimes prevented in cats. Pheromones and supplements can help reduce the stress of environmental changes. Medications can ease serious cases of anxiety. By helping to decrease the amount of stress your cat experiences, you will hopefully lessen the likelihood of them picking up the bad habit of inappropriate chewing. Allowing your indoor cat to slowly adjust to new things, providing safe spaces, avoiding the line of sight with outdoor cats by closing the blinds, and other techniques can also help avoid stressing out your cat.</p><p>It may be obvious, keeping plastic items out of your cat's reach is key to prevention. Pick up and dispose of plastic items such as rubber bands, plastic lids, milk jug rings, and plastic bags that are within a cat's reach to eliminate the opportunity for your cat to get its paws on it. If you don't want your cat to chew on an item, then hide it or get rid of it.</p><p>Finally, a great way to relieve boredom and keep a cat disinterested in plastic items is to attract them to items that are not plastic. Provide your cat with fun and safe toys of different textures and fabrics, use feather wands and laser pointers to entertain it, and use catnip or treats to attract it to other items you want them to play with or chew on.</p>",839
40,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-does-my-cat-stare-at-me-while-i-sleep-5225569,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Why Cats Stare at You While You Sleep and How to Stop It </h1>,"<h1>Why Cats Stare at You While You Sleep and How to Stop It </h1><p>If you've ever been rudely woken up from a deep and serene sleep thanks to a heavy cat sitting on your chest and wafting cat breath into your face, you're not alone. Staring at humans while they sleep is a common cat behavior, albeit a puzzling (and sometimes annoying) one.</p><p>As it turns out, catsstareat people a lot, not just while they're sleeping. Cats often stare at you while you're awake for the same reasons they stare at you while you're peacefully sleeping. Cats sometimesstare at wallsor other innominate objects, but that's often a sign of a cognitive issue (and something to get checked out by your vet if you notice it happening).</p><p>Let's take a look at some of the top reasons a cat might be staring at you while you sleep, and learn some helpful tips for putting a stop to this behavior (if you want to!).</p><h2>Hunger</h2><p>Hunger is one of the biggest reasons you might wake up to a cat staring at you while you sleep, eyes boring deep into your face, especially if this occurs in the early morning hours. Almost nothing motivates a cat more than an empty food bowl. If you notice that your cat is routinely waking you up in the early morning hours, then racing over to the food dish, you can bet that it's ready for breakfast.</p><p>There are a few ways to stop a hungry cat from staring at you and waking you up before you are ready. One solution is locking your cat out of your room while you sleep (this one has its drawbacks no warm, purring cat to cuddle with at night). This doesn't always work anyway. Some cats are determined to get to you no matter the barrier, and will paw or scratch at the door or meow loudly until you give up and let them in.</p><p>Another option is to invest in an automatic feeder that dispenses breakfast right on time so your cat doesn't feel the need to wake you up. You can also fill some puzzle feeders with some of your cat's regular meal and leave them in various places in the house for your cat to ""hunt"" for its food.</p><h2>Boredom</h2><p>If you wake up in the middle of the night to your cat staring you down in the dark, chances are she wants to play. Cats are crepuscular, which means they are naturally most alert and active at dawn and dusk. This can be problematic for a cat living with humans, who often prefer to sleep past sunrise. Luckily, cats sleep a lot about 13 hours a day on average. This means your cat won't be up the entire night, though it might feel energized for part of the night. Your cat may entertain itself by prowling around the house or hitting up the food bowl (see above should the food bowl go empty). But some cats, especially kittens, can't resist the temptation to try to wake you up, too, so they can have someone to play with.</p><p>The key to getting your kitty to sleep more at night involves engaging it in more activity and play in the early evening hours. From the time you come home from work, make it your mission to play with your cat, using feather wands, tossing fuzzy mice or balls to chase, or having a fun session with the laser pointer (be sure not to shine the light into your cat's eyes). Later, when it's closer to bed time, wind things down with some quiet cuddling and pets on the couch. With enough activity in the evening, your cat should be ready to settle down to sleep when it's time to get into bed.</p><h2>Fear or Pain</h2><p>If your cat is afraid or feeling anxious, she might sit close to you and stare in an attempt to communicate its concern. Cats might also crawl close and stare intently at you if they are experiencing pain. If your cat doesn't usually stare at you while you're sleeping, but suddenly begins to do it regularly, take a closer look at the situation. If you have another cat in the house, make sure your cat is not being pestered, ambushed, or even attacked. If your cat is limping, resists being touched, stops eating or drinking, or experiences changes in its litter box habits, schedule a visit with your vet for a checkup.</p><h2>Love</h2><p>If your cat stares at you while you sleep, it might simply be conveying its deep love and affection for you. If the staring is accompanied by purring, head butts, slow blinks, and facial rubbing, you can be certain that she's expressing her love. This reason for your cat staring at you while you sleep is harder to resolve than some others, and maybe you don't want to, especially if your cat is not disturbing your beauty rest. After all, cats can be choosy with their affection, so roll over, pull up the covers and consider yourself blessed to be loved by your feline friend.</p>",840
41,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-wake-up-calls-554049,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Reasons Why Your Cat Meows at Night</h1>,"<h1>Reasons Why Your Cat Meows at Night</h1><p>Cats aren't usually as noisy as dogs, but that doesn't mean they don't vocalize. Cats will meow, scream, yowl, cry, and make other noises. Sometimes these noises are during the day in response to various stimuli, but many times they are at night when you are trying to sleep.</p><h2>Why Won't Your Cat Sleep at Night?</h2><p>Cats are naturally active and awake at night while you are trying to sleep. They might want to play, explore, eat, scratch, or get your attention and sometimes these actions are quite noisy and we wake up. Some cats are also especially lazy during the day. These cats will have a lot of energy to burn at night since they didn't expend much of it at all while you were awake.</p><h2>Meowing for Attention at Night</h2><p>If your cat is active, curious, and loves to play, then they may be waking you up at night with their meows seeking your attention. Cats will do many things to get attention, including scratching at your bedroom door, pawing at you, bumping into you, flopping down on the floor in front of you and, of course, meowing. If your cat is crying for your attention while you're trying to sleep, the best thing you can do in the moment is to ignore them. This is of course hard for some people, but if you give your cat attention while they are meowing for it, you will only be reinforcing the unwanted behavior. Even if you give your cat negative attention by yelling at it, you are still giving it attention. Earplugs may be your only solution until you can prevent the nightly meowing.</p><p>The next day, make sure you are wearing your cat out during the day by giving it toys to play with. Puzzle toys, feather wands, laser pointers, and battery powered chase toys are great solutions. There are even laser pointers on some pet cameras that can be controlled by you when you are away at work, so you can play with your cat even when you aren't home. By exhausting your cat and giving it all the attention it needs during the day, it will be less likely to want to meow at night.</p><h2>Meowing for Food at Night</h2><p>Did you forget to feed your cat? Cats often cry for food or treats and a hungry cat at night is not a quiet cat. You won't get much sleep if your cat is hungry, so make sure you feed it before going to bed. Do not get up in response to its cries at night, as this will only teach your cat that you will feed it when it meows at you. If you have a difficult work schedule or are concerned about forgetting to feed your cat, consider an automatic cat feeder that controls the meal time and amount of food your cat will get. This will guarantee a regular feeding schedule and your cat is less likely to associate you with getting fed. Also make sure that your cat always has access to clean water to eliminate thirst as a reason for nighttime activity and noise.</p><h2>Meowing Because of Cognitive Dysfunction</h2><p>Similar to people with dementia, cats can develop cognitive dysfunction that affects their ability to understand what's going on around them. It is not fully understood in cats, but we do know that elderly cats who appear confused and meow for no apparent reason often get worse at night. If you suspect your cat has some sort of cognitive dysfunction, get a definitive diagnosis and discuss treatment options with your veterinarian. Special foods and nutritional supplements may be recommended to help keep your cat's brain functioning as best as it can.</p><h2>Meowing Because of Anxiety, Stress, Discomfort and Pain</h2><p>Any health condition or situation that leads to anxiety, stress, discomfort or pain can make pet restless and more vocal than normal. Talk to your veterinarian if your cat develops behavioral changes or physical symptoms of illness that appear during the day or night.</p><h2>Meowing Because of Eye Sight Issues or Deafness</h2><p>If a cat cannot see or hear well, they may be scared or confused. At night your house is usually darker and quieter than it is during the day, and if your cat's eye sight is failing or they are deaf and can't see you, they may meow to receive help or comfort. Your cat may also not be aware that they are meowing loudly because they cannot hear themselves well. Eye sight can deteriorate with age and disease, as can hearing, so if your previously well-sighted and hearing-capable cat seems to be losing its senses, get it checked out by your veterinarian.</p>",776
42,https://www.thesprucepets.com/stop-cat-marking-554043,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Train Your Cat to Stop Urine Marking</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Cat to Stop Urine Marking</h1><h2>There are many reasons why cats may mark their turf</h2><p>A cat urinating outside the box can be marking behavior, where a cat feels the need to mark its territory. But there are some underlying health conditions which may cause a cat to urinate outside the litter box and some environmental causes as well.</p><p>If this behavior has happened more than once or twice, you may want to bring your cat to the vet to rule out any health issues. If it is, in fact, marking behavior, there are steps you can take to curb it.</p><h2>Marking Their Turf</h2><p>Cats use urine to mark territory that's important to them. Cats often get along quite well until they reach social maturity between 2 to 4 years of age.House-soiling usually involves squatting and depositing urine or feces on a horizontal surface, while urine marking tends to target vertical surfaces.</p><p>However, cats can urine-mark on either horizontal or vertical surfaces. Intact male cats are the more typical culprit for urine-spraying, but neutered cats of either sex can decide to baptize the house.</p><h2>Check the Litter Box</h2><p>Cats will snub the litter box if it's in the wrong spot (too near food or sleeping spots); if it's not clean, or sometimes when they have to share with another cat. They may not want to ""go"" after another kitty or want a different box for solids and another for liquids.</p><p>Cats also have very specific preferences for the types of box filters or surfaces, and sometimes the box may be too small to accommodate a big-tailed feline.</p><h2>Reduce Stress</h2><p>Spreading the scent of urine around actually helps lower cats' stress levels.Cats like routine and anything that disrupts their normal day-to-day could put their tails in a twist. That could be anything from new drapes, a stray cat that patrols outside the window, or even your work schedule being unpredictable.</p><p>In the spring when stray cats go into heat, the scent and sound can prompt indoor cats to become more stressed and increase territorial marking.</p><p>In addition, stress can make any medical or behavioral problems worse. So whether your cat's issue has to do with health issues or strictly territorial marking, a stress-reduction program should help.</p><h2>Use Feliway and Rescue Remedy</h2><p>If you have more than one cat, your cats may be at the age when they've reached social maturity and may be jostling for position within the household. The Feliway synthetic pheromone can be helpful because it signals the cat that its environment is safe. Rescue Remedy also works for a percentage of cats for reducing stress.</p><h2>Eliminate Odor and Create New Associations</h2><p>Pay attention to where your cat urine marks. A black light should make urine glow, so you can clearly see any soiled areas. Clean thoroughly with an odor neutralizer product such asAnti-Icky-Poo, which eliminates the odor that draws cats back to the scene (and scent) of the crime. Ammonia and bleach also work well. The goal is to remove the odor so the cat doesn't think it's OK to ""go"" there again.</p><p>Next, change the association of the place by placing toys, a cat bed, or food bowls right on top of the spot. Cats won't want to spray where they play, sleep, or eat. Spraying the Feliway on the inappropriate spot also can deter a repeat.</p><h2>Add Another Litter Box</h2><p>With multiple cats, you may need to coddle twice as much (or more). Offer at least one litter box per cat, and space these in different parts of the house. Make sure they are extra big because some cats just like the added space to maneuver.</p><p>Similarly, provide scratching objects and resting places for each cat in a variety of places throughout the home. Extra vertical space can allow cats to climb and get away from each other, while each ""owns"" its own resting spot.

43,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pooping-in-the-sink-or-bathtub-554003,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Pooping in the Sink or Bathtub</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Pooping in the Sink or Bathtub</h1><p>There are a few explanations as to why your cat might suddenly have abandoned its litter box and started pooping in the shower, bathtub, or sink. It's a frustrating, smelly, and all-around unpleasant turn of events. Fortunately, if your kitty is healthy, you can probably stop this unwanted behavior by changing up things in your bathroom and making the litter box more inviting.</p><p>Feline bathroom behavior varies between cats, and litter box issues may stem from underlying health conditions, stress, environmental factors, or a combination of any of these. It's helpful for you to take some time to review your cat's emotional and physical health so you can determine what the problem is and how best to solve it.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Poop in the Bathtub or Sink?</h2><p>Cats are generally very clean and neat animals. When your cat defecates in an off-limits area after faithfully using its litter box, termed house soiling, it's trying to tell you something. First, check the litter box to make sure it's not full, smells odd, or has tipped over. Also, make sure that nothing has blocked your cat's access to the litter box. Anything about the box that seems off to your cat may prompt it to do its business somewhere else.</p><h2>Health Issues</h2><p>Then, consider a health issue. Cats that make a point of eliminating in front of the owner, squatting to pee or poop in your presence, may be crying out for help. Cystitis (inflammation of the bladder) and bladder stones sometimes prompt cats to defecate (and urinate) in inappropriate places and they may make a point of it by posturing in front of their human. Painful elimination due to constipation, for example, can prompt cats to avoid the litter box if they associate it with discomfort. If you suspect the change is due to a health concern, make an appointment with your vet right away. The vet will likely conduct a physical exam and may also use bloodwork or radiographs to determine if there is an infection or digestive or urinary issue.</p><h2>Behavioral Issues</h2><p>A change in the household dynamics is a frequent cause of stress and anxiety in sensitive cats and may result in their defecating outside the litter box. Examples of this may include an addition to the family such as a new baby or the loss of a family member. Additionally, major changes in your daily routine may trigger stress for your cat, such as a new work schedule, or increased time the cat is left alone. Certainly the addition of a new pet to the house can result in house soiling as well.</p><p>Defecating outside the litter box is rarely a form of marking behavior, which is most frequently demonstrated by urinating on vertical surfaces.</p><h2>How to Stop Your Cat Defecating in the Bathtub or Sink</h2><p>Once health causes have been ruled out, there are a few simple measures you can take to help modify your cat's unwanted behavior. Try the technique that seems to work best for your cat, lifestyle, and situation. Feel free to make a few changes at once.</p><h2>Litter Box Changes</h2><p>Making some simple changes to the actual litter box can help the situation. Add a second litter box, preferably in a different room so that your cat has an option. Empty litter boxes up to 2 or 3 times a day and clean it out once a week. Try to use a larger sized litter box to encourage its use. Base the litter box size on the cat's size and not the location it fits in. The box should be about 1 1/2 times the size of your cat.</p><h2>What to Avoid</h2><p>Make sure the litter box is not near where the cat eats and drinks. Some cats don't like covered or automatic cleaning boxes. The lights, noise, and automatic actions can scare cats and an enclosed box can feel claustrophobic. These may be enough to make a cat avoid using its box.</p><h2>Changes to the Environment</h2><p>Fill the sink and tub with a small amount of water. This water may discourage your cat from entering the tub or sink and prevent the action from occurring. Try a new brand of litter. Some cats don't like the texture, smell, or other factors of certain types.</p><h2>Next Steps</h2><p>If your cat continues this behavior even after environmental changes have been made, a veterinary behaviorist that specializes in felines could be helpful. This person can help reteach your cat the appropriate behavior and may come up with some solutions that are specific to your cat and living situation. Some behavioral issues, especially issues stemming from anxiety, may be alleviated through the use of behavior modifying medications. If the problem persists, discuss this option with your veterinarian. Never give your pet any medication intended for use in humans.</p>",797
44,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pushy-cat-behavior-554063,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>Dealing With Dominant and Anxious Cat Behavior</h1>,"<h1>Dealing With Dominant and Anxious Cat Behavior</h1><p>Cats will wrestle and play with each other and sometimes even get a little rough, but that can be normal cat behavior. Cats who live together and that normally get along will exhibit non-painful ear biting, grabbing, and chasing as a part of their playful activities. These behaviors develop when a cat is a very young kitten and are understood by other well-socialized cats. Cats who were not well socialized may not know how to communicate with other cats, or sometimes dynamics arise within a multi-cat household that alter how even the most well-socialized cats interact with each other. Cats who start to show signs of dominance or anxiety can be challenging to work with, especially in multi-cat households.</p><h2>Dominant Cat Behavior</h2><p>Cats who are more dominant than other cats will display some specific behaviors depending on the situation they are in. Dominance in a cat can appear at a young age but it will become especially apparent once mature or when it's about two to four years of age. This is the age cats typically will test their boundaries with other cats to establish a hierarchy.</p><p>Simple dominance will be exhibited by a cat by marking or spraying urine on territory, stealing and hoarding toys, rubbing its face on items it wants to claim as its own, claiming specific areas to sleep, pushing other cats away from the food bowl, and/or starting at or physically intimidating other cats. Cats who live alone may exhibit some of these behaviors too. A dominant cat that lives with other cats will have more obvious behaviors.</p><p>Dominant cats may attempt to establish their dominance in a multiple cat household by hissing, hitting, and growling. They may also urinate outside of the litter box in areas that the other cats frequent, push other cats out of the food bowl until they are done eating, and make the other cats feel threatened. Dominant cats may also target sick cats in the house. Cats can sense and smell changes in other cats, often before the owner even knows about it. Therefore, they may be more aggressive and act out for no apparent reason towards a cat that isn't feeling well.</p><p>Stress can also trigger a cat to act out. For example, displaced aggression is often observed in multiple cat households when an indoor cat sees an outdoor cat through a window and takes out its anxiety on a cat in the home. Other major household changes may also cause this type of behavior including introductions of new pets or people, moving to a new home, construction in the home, and other stressful events.</p><p>Hierarchy can change with the introduction of a new cat or if you have several cats living together. Some cats will act dominantly in one room with one cat and suddenly switch roles in another room with another cat. Mannerisms from the dominant cat, such as excessive licking, standing on, or sitting on the other cat may be displayed, and swatting and even biting may occur.</p><h2>Why Are Some Cats More Dominant Than Others?</h2><p>While cats can be solitary animals, social hierarchies are also normal when many cats live in the same small area. Some cats are considered more dominant or more submissive and this can be within the normal spectrum of cat behaviors. Additionally, socialization for kittens is an important part of learning how to navigate these interactions with other cats. Kittens who don't have an opportunity to play and interact with litter mates or other cats may exhibit more extreme behaviors because they didn't learn from other cats. Feral kittens, kittens who needed to fight for their food, kittens who were bottle-fed and raised without other cats may also be more at risk for having undesirable behaviors. Finally, some cats can experience a behavior change related to stress or a medical problem which can cause them to exhibit behaviors that are out of character for them.</p><h2>Preventing Dominant Behaviors in Cats</h2><p>You should consult your veterinarian if you notice a sudden behavior change in one of your cats, or escalating aggression toward cats or people. There are some underlying medical conditions that could lead to these changes and your veterinarian can help determine if there is a health problem. And if the problem is strictly behavioral, working with your veterinarian as well as a trainer can be the best way to help your cat and reestablish harmony in your home.</p><h2>Reinforcing Positive Behavior in Cats</h2><p>Positively reinforcing good behaviors is better than trying to punish a cat. When your cats are spending time together, be sure to give them treats and pet them. Play with them together while giving them treats and verbally praise them if they are getting along well. This will reinforce the type of behaviors you want to see in your cats, even if one of them is more dominant or pushy than the other.</p>",811
45,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cats-and-mirrors-553931,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Cat Behavior Problems,<h1>How to Train Your Cat to Accept Mirror Reflections</h1>,"<h1>How to Train Your Cat to Accept Mirror Reflections</h1><p>Cats know they're beautiful but their reaction to a cat reflection in the mirror varies widely. Some cats completely ignore the reflected kitty while others are curious, possibly wondering why this other feline doesn't have a unique scent. Still, other cats may exhibit aggressive or fearful behavior when they see their reflection. If your cat is showing a negative reaction, there are ways you can help.</p><h2>Understand the Possible Cause</h2><p>Quite often, the key to helping a cat overcome a negative behavior to a stimulus is exploring the possible causes of their reaction. In the case of mirrors and reflections, there are a number of reasons a cat may act out, hide from the ""intruder,"" or become genuinely terrified.</p><p>One of the most common is found in young cats who have never seen a mirror. Kittens who have lived their entire life in an animal shelter may not have been exposed to common household things like mirrors, carpet, or TVs and radios. When they are adopted and brought into a home, each of these things can bring on a fear of the unknown.</p><p>Other cats may be familiar with their reflection, then react when seeing another cat in a mirror. For instance, your kitten may be used to seeing its own reflection and associate that with a ""happy"" cat. Then, if you have another cat visit, your kitten can smell the new cat but not the cat's reflection. The absence of a distinct scent for this fourth cat can really throw a kitten off and invoke a reaction of stranger danger.</p><p>Another scenario involves a cat associating a reflection in a glass window with danger outside that window, such as a stray cat who wanders into your yard. A cat who is naturally scared or aggressive may come to associate this shiny surface of a mirror with the negative experience. They may also come to associate this hostility to their own reflection and become suspicious of that intruder, even if it was previously accepted.</p><h2>Observe the Behavior</h2><p>Cats will react to reflections in various ways. It's good to observe your cat for a little bit to determine if it is displaying fearful or aggressive tendencies. For many cats, it's just a passing phase, part of growing up and experiencing their new world.</p><p>Quite often, cats attempt to find the other cat by pawing underneath or at the side of the mirror to ""get around"" the barrier preventing contact. It's similar to what many cats do when they see TV images of birds or other critters, mistaking the screen for a window.</p><p>A mirror-gazing kitty who cannot find the source may become suspicious so its fearful reflection also triggers defensive body language. Then, seeing its own aggressive/fearful/defensive language in the reflection makes it think that cat-in-the-mirror means business, so it reacts accordingly.</p><h2>Cover Up Mirrors</h2><p>Many cats eventually figure out that the reflected cat is not a danger, but others do not. They may take it to the level of attacking the mirror in an attempt to ward off this intruder. The behavior may intensify and possibly become an obsession if it's not addressed.</p><p>In these cases, you may need to remove all reflective surfaces that are at your cat's level. In the least, you can tape paper or hang a cloth over mirrors so your cat can no longer see its reflection and gets to practice the aggressive behavior.</p><h2>Keep Real Intruders at Bay</h2><p>If you have observed that stray cats in the neighborhood are amping up your cat's reactivity to windows and mirrors, you will want to shoo them away. While you employ various tactics to keep cats out of your yard, keep the curtains closed so your cat does not see them. Once you've been successful in your deterrents, you can slowly go back to normal, open the curtains, and your cat may become more receptive to reflections again.</p><h2>Reintroduce Mirrors</h2><p>After some time of taking these preventative steps, you may be able to slowly reintroduce your cat to mirrors. When doing so, be sure the mirror is associated with positive experiences such as toys, treats, or catnip. Lure your cat in front of an exposed mirror with their favorite item and let them enjoy it. They may be distracted enough to ignore the reflection or notice that the reflection is also very happy and is not a threat.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>In time and with more experience, most cats can put mirror-angst behind them. If your cat continues to have anxiety around mirrors, you may need some extra help. Pheromone products like Comfort Zone with Feliway can help calm upset feelings. You can spray this around the mirror or use a diffuser to spread the scent throughout the room.</p>",783
46,https://www.thesprucepets.com/kitten-litter-box-training-555187,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Litter Box Training,<h1>Training Your Kitten to Use the Litter Box</h1>,"<h1>Training Your Kitten to Use the Litter Box</h1><p>When you bring home a new kitten, one of the very first things you will need to teach them is how to use the litter box. Proper litter box training early on will help your kitten develop healthy habits for life.</p><p>Your new kitten may or may not already know how to use a litter box. It all depends on how it was raised by its mother. Kittens learn most of their behaviors from their mother over the first six weeks of their lives. If the mother uses a litter box, then the kitten will likely learn this before being adopted into a new home. Howevers, if the kitten was raised outdoors or was separated from the mother too early, it might have no knowledge of litter boxes or even proper elimination habits. This is where you come in and begin litter box training.</p><h2>Choosing a Litter Box</h2><p>Your kitten needs an easily accessible litter box, so choose something with low sides that it can easily step into. It should be big enough for the kitten to turn around and eliminate in more than one spot as well. A basic small plastic litter box can work well. However, you may wish to start with something like an old baking pan or a shirt box with a liner, especially if your kitten is very tiny.</p><p>Covered litter boxes may or may not work for your kitten. In the beginning, it may be best to use an open box so you can observe your kitten in it. Once your kitten learns to use the box, you may wish to try covering one box and leaving another open so you can learn if your cat has a preference. Some cats prefer the privacy of a covered box, while others dislike the closed-in feeling.</p><p>If you have multiple cats, a good rule of thumb is to have one litter box per cat, plus one extra. It's still a good idea to have two litter boxes if your kitten is the only cat in your home. In a multi-story home, put a litter box on each level. </p><h2>Types of Litter</h2><p>The type of litter you choose can make a big difference in how well your kitten takes to litter box training. The texture of scoopable litter is generally preferred by cats over the larger non-scoopable clay style. Unscented litter is best because perfumes can overwhelm your kitten's sensitive olfactory system.</p><p>Be aware that some kittens will eat cat litter when they are first introduced to it. This can lead to dangerous gastrointestinal problems. For this reason, you may wish to choose corn- or wheat-based scoopable litter.</p><p>You may also wish to get a mat to place outside the box to catch litter particles as kitty steps out. Make sure you choose something that will feel soft and comfortable on your cat's paws. Rough or spiky surfaces are likely to deter your cat from entering the litter box.</p><h2>Creating A Safe and Clean Environment</h2><p>The litter box should be placed in a private yet accessible area of your home. Avoid cramped spaces like under cabinets or in small closets. Make sure the box is not next to a loud appliance or something else that makes scary noises.</p><p>The litter box should not be placed near your kitten's food and water dishes, nor should it be too close to your kitten's favorite sleeping spots. Kittens and cats naturally prefer not to eliminate near their food and beds.</p><p>Maintain a clean litter box and keep the surrounding area as clean as possible. Scoop the litter box once or twice a day. Immediately clean up any accidents made outside the box and sweep up stray litter pieces regularly.</p><p>A clean, neutral-smelling litter box is much more inviting to cats and kittens. A dirty litter box can easily lead to unwanted elimination behaviors, like peeing on laundry or rugs.</p><h2>Training Steps</h2><p>The litter box area should be all set up before you bring your new kitten home. It is usually advised to start new kittens out in a ""transition room"" that is safe, comfortable, and keeps the kitten isolated from other areas of the home. This can also really help with litter box training.</p><p>Set up the food and water on one side of the room and put the litter box as far away as possible. Keep your kitten in the room for the first several days to weeks until it seems comfortable in the environment. Once you let kitty out to explore the rest of your home, it's best to return it to this room when you are not home.</p><p>Right after your kitten eats or drinks, place it in the litter box and do this each time. You may even try scratching at the litter to show the kitten what to do. If you see your kitten sniffing or scratching the ground, place it in the litter box.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If your kitten is peeing or pooping in the room and not in the box, gently place it in the litter box. Do not scold or punish your kitten for eliminating outside the box. This will only make it associate the litter box with negative things and deter kitty from using it.</p><p>If your kitten uses the litter box, offer praise with petting or even a toy or treat. First, let the kitten explore the area and make its own way out of the litterbox. Don't scoop up the area right away; let the scent remain as a reminder to your kitten later.</p><h2>Problems and Proofing Behavior</h2><p>Most kittens will learn to use the litter box fairly quickly. It may take longer for some kittens, so try to be patient. If your kitten has one or two specific areas in the house where it likes to eliminate, move the litter boxes to these areas. If this does not work, try changing the litter box or the cat litter brand or type.</p><p>When considering litter boxes, try to put yourself in your cat's position. Is there something in the area that is frightening or distracting? Perhaps there is a sight or sound that makes your cat want to avoid the area. Maybe the litter box has a strong plastic smell to it. Perhaps the litter does not feel good on the paws or has an odor kitty dislikes. You may need to make several small changes before your kitten will accept the litter box.</p><p>Remember, never punish your cat for accidents. Be consistent about moving the kitten to the litter box if you catch it in the middle of an accident. Try not to get angry or frustrated. Stress in the environment is the main cause of behavioral litter box issues. This means you may need to assess your kitten's environment. Are there other pets in the home causing stress? Is your kitten acting anxious or restless? Perhaps it needs more exercise or vertical space.</p>",1138
47,https://www.thesprucepets.com/help-with-cat-pooping-on-rug-554023,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Litter Box Training,<h1>How to Stop Cats From Pooping on Rugs</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Cats From Pooping on Rugs</h1><h2>Dealing With Inappropriate Elimination in Cats</h2><p>Litter-trained cats may be trained to do their business in the litterbox, but if your cat is pooping outside the box and on your rug, that's a sign of inappropriate elimination. Litter box problems are among the most common behavioral issues experienced by cat owners, and this frustrating behavior can be difficult for cat owners to manage.</p><p>The key to solving the problem is figuring out why your cat is pooping in inappropriate places, like your nicest rug. Find out why cats could be prone to defecating on rugs and how to resolve the behavioral issue.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Poop on Rugs?</h2><p>Out of all the places in a home, it seems that rugs are popular targets for inappropriate elimination. There's something about the fabric that attracts cats. Perhaps it's the fact that rugs are easy to knead and paw at like litter, or maybe it's the scent. Absorbancy is likely a factor as well. You may never know for sure why your cat seems to prefer the rug, but many cat owners report this same issue.</p><p>Cats are often mysterious, so getting to the bottom of the problem will take careful observation. You'll need to eliminate the potential causes one at a time.</p><h2>Causes of Cats Pooping on Rugs</h2><p>No matter where your cat is pooping, if it's outside the litter box, there are a few possible explanations for it.</p><h3>Medical Issues</h3><p>Before you assume the inappropriate elimination is a behavior problem, it's important to have your cat's health evaluated. During the checkup, your vet will talk to you about your cat's behavior and ask if there are any other signs, such as vomiting, diarrhea, change in appetite, or lethargy. The vet will thoroughly examine your cat for signs of a health problem. Lab tests and/or radiographs (X-rays) may be recommended as well.</p><p>Something as simple as constipation may cause a cat to defecate on a rug or in another inappropriate spot. For example, your backed-up cat suddenly has the urge to relieve himself, but he might not be able to get to the litter box in time.</p><p>Pain or discomfort may also account for inappropriate pooping. Maybe your cat has trouble getting in and out of the litter box and waits to defecate until he can't hold it anymore. Perhaps the posture the cat finds most comfortable is easier to achieve on the living room rug. Your vet may discover a condition such as arthritis and offer a treatment that makes your cat more comfortable.</p><p>Be aware that older cats may develop dementia. This can affect your cat's habits and even cause him to ""forget"" years of training. Your vet may be able to recommend medications or supplements to help in this situation too.</p><h3>Behavioral Causes</h3><p>Once you've ruled out a health problem, it's time to consider behavioral causes. There are a few reasons your cat's habits may suddenly have changed.</p><h2>How to Stop Inappropriate Pooping</h2><p>It's difficult to break the habit once your cat has started pooping outside the litter box. There are several steps you'll need to take to break this bad habit and you'll need to keep up with your cat religiously to stop this behavior.</p><h3>Clean Up the Evidence</h3><p>Start by making sure to thoroughly clean the areas where your cat has pooped. If you're unable to get the area clean enough, your cat will continue to be attracted to the spot. Launder any items that can go in the washing machine. If your cat has pooped on a bathmat or inexpensive rug, you might just need to get rid of the item. For best results, use a high-quality enzymatic cleaner for pet messes.</p><h3>Reevaluate the Litter Box</h3><p>Cats want to use ultra-clean litter boxes and tend to prefer roomy, open boxes. Try switching to jumbo litter boxes without covers. You can even consider turning a large plastic under-the-bed storage box into a king-sized makeshift litter box. If you only have one litter box, add a second one in a different area. Consider putting the second box near the place where your cat has been pooping inappropriately. If you have multiple cats, you may need to add even more litter boxes. A good general rule of thumb is that there should be one more litter box in the house than there are cats. There should also be litter boxes on every floor of the home.</p><h3>Consider the Litter</h3><p>If you're using scented litter, switch to unscented right away. While humans may prefer the scented litter to cover up odors, many cats find artificial scents overwhelming and repulsive. Remember that your cat has a much more sensitive nose than you do. Your cat may also dislike the texture of the litter. Use a new type of litter in the second box and see if your cat prefers it. Consider the size of the litter particles as well as whether the litter is clumping or non-clumping. You can also consider a litter specially designed to appeal to cats, like Dr. Elsey's Cat Attract.</p><h3>Work on Training</h3><p>Your cat may need a refresher course in litter box training, particularly if the cat is young or was recently adopted.</p><h3>Deter Your Cat From Using Inappropriate Areas</h3><p>If there are a couple of specific places where your cat tries to poop, attempt to make these areas as unattractive as possible. Lay down aluminum foil or double-sided tape until your cat stops trying to approach these areas. Do your best to make the litter box the most appealing option.</p><h3>Reduce Stress in Your Home</h3><p>If there's a new cat in the house, make sure you properly introduce the two of them. If it's another animal or even a human, you may need to gradually desensitize your cat to the source of the stress. Make sure your cat has a safe place to retreat when needed. Also, be sure there's enough space so that the food bowl and the litter box aren't next to each other.</p><h3>Improve Your Cat's Environment and Play With Your Cat Daily</h3><p>Learn about feline enrichment to make your cat's world more fulfilling. Consider adding vertical space, like a cat tree or wall shelves to give your cat more places to go. Try leaving interactive toys around when you are out. Play with your cat as often as possible. A frustrated, bored cat is much more likely to act out.</p><h3>Be Patient and Consistent</h3><p>Change won't happen overnight, so don't stress out. Just work hard to clean the soiled areas, keep the litter box clean and attractive, and maintain a happy and fun environment for your cat.</p><h3>Contact Your Vet</h3><p>If things aren't improving and you're at your limit, don't give up. Ask your vet for a referral to a veterinary behaviorist or applied animal behaviorist. It will be worth the investment to have an expert weigh in.</p>",1120

You might be tempted to take strong action, such as yelling at the cat, rubbing its nose in the mess, or even rehoming your pet. But resist those urges, and instead, consider possible medical conditions or behavioral issues, because most often, one of those is the root of the problem.</p><p>Common reasons for cats to stop using their litter boxes include urinary tract disease or other health issues, a litter box that isn't cleaned often enough, or stress caused by a change in the household, such as a new pet or family member.</p><p>Cats are sometimes accused of being spiteful, but it's unlikely that that's why your feline family member is refusing to use its litter box. Urinating outside the litter box is an unfortunately common feline misbehavior that often leads to the owner giving up the cat. Before you go down that road, however, you should know that there's hope for your kitty.</p><p>Not only can you learn how to best deal with urinary problems in your cat, but you may be able to prevent some urinary issues in the first place. Find out below why your cat is urinating outside of its litter box and how to stop inappropriate litter box behavior.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Pee Outside the Litter Box?</h2><p>Before you can begin to correct a litter box problem, it's important to understand why your cat is peeing inappropriately. A cat urinates outside its litter box for one of two general reasons: a medical problem or a behavioral issue.</p><h2>Medical Problems</h2><p>If your cat is peeing inappropriately, the first step is to visit your veterinarian. The vet will do a physical exam of your cat and check a urine sample. Based on the results, your vet will recommend treatment.</p><p>When one or more urinary issues are chronic, the condition is typically called , or FLUTD. If your cat is diagnosed with FLUTD, your vet may recommend a special urinary diet and/or supplements to support the urinary tract.</p><p>Urinary problems can lead to a serious, urinary obstruction, especially in male cats. If your cat is experiencing urinary issues, don't delay the trip to the vet. If your cat is posturing to urinate and little or no urine is coming out, your cat might have a blockage or partial obstruction. In this case, get your cat to a vet immediately as this condition can quickly become life-threatening.</p><p>In some cases, inappropriate urination occurs when a cat has a nonurinary health problem. Your cat may be peeing outside the box because of pain or discomfort elsewhere in the body. It's a good idea to have your vet order comprehensive lab work to look for a health issue if none is found during the initial exam or urinalysis. Lab work can reveal serious health problems like diabetes or kidney disease, allowing your vet to begin treatment immediately.</p><h2>Behavioral Reasons</h2><p>If no medical cause is found for your cat's inappropriate urination, then it's important to determine what factors are causing your cat to behave this way.</p><h2>Dirty Litter Box</h2><p>Cats are particular about their toilets. The litter box may simply be too dirty for your cat. Or it may be perfectly clean but otherwise uncomfortable to use. For example, the box may be too small for your cat to use comfortably. Or it may be in a location that your cat doesn't like. If it's covered, this may bother your cat. Perhaps the litter has a strong scent or an annoying feel on your cat's paws. Cat's like choice so too few litter boxes can also be an issue.</p><h2>Stress</h2><p>Your cat may be trying to tell you it's stressed out at home. It may be unhappy with another animal in the household and is marking its territory to send a message to the other animal. Or your cat may sense that it's too dangerous to access the litter box if the other animal is out and about. Your cat may also ""act out"" if there is a new human in the home.</p><p>Cats are sensitive to the smallest of changes in their environments. No matter what the source of the stress is, make sure your cat has a quiet place where it can get away. The new animal or human should not have access to this place of refuge.</p><h2>Old Urine Smells</h2><p>If your cat has peed in an area, the smell might remain even after you clean up the accident. A cat's sense of smell is much better than yours. If old urine odors remain in your home, there's a very good chance your cat is returning to the area because of the smell.</p><h2>How to Stop Inappropriate Litter Box Behavior</h2><p>Perhaps the most common reason cats urinate inappropriately is that they dislike the litter box. If your cat is peeing everywhere and you've ruled out medical issues, then it's time to reassess your litter boxes.</p><p>In general, the key to stopping inappropriate urination in cats or avoiding it altogether is as simple as being a responsible, attentive cat owner. Keep your cat healthy and visit the vet for routine care and as soon as issues crop up. Minimize anxiety in your cat's environment and try to keep a cat-friendly, low-stress home.</p><p>Cats can go up to two days, or 48 hours, without urinating.</p><p>Figuring out the reason your cat is peeing on the bed might bring along the answer: does it have its own box? If it's sharing, try giving each cat its own box. Is the litter box in a well-trafficked area? Give it some privacy! Have other pets also peed on your bed? That might be just the invitation this one needs. Wash your linens with an enzymatic cleaning solution to be sure no odor remains. Are your cats fighting? This may be how one is ""marking"" its territory. Make sure each has enough of its space, and try a pheromone-diffuser to keep the peace. Finally, and most importantly, a cat is peeing on your bed might be because it has a UTI or other medical problem involving the bladder, and an urgent vet visit is in order ASAP.</p><p>There are a number of reasons your cat could be peeing blood, otherwise known as hematuria: feline lower urinary tract disorder, cystitis, bladder stones, and more. This is an urgent problem, and you need to go to your veterinary emergency room sooner rather than later.</p>",1086

It is used instinctively by a cat to bury its urine and feces, but some owners have preferences for what type of litter they'd like their cats to use.</p><p>Historically, clay cat litter was the only option for absorbing urine and allowing a cat to practice the natural behavior of burying its waste matter, but, now, many different options are available.</p><p>Price, odor control, the amount of dust, absorbency, how well it clumps, availability to purchase, scent or lack thereof, and other factors may play a role in the type of litter you or your cat prefer.</p><p>In addition to the following types of cat litter, some people will also temporarily use cat litter substitutes that they find lying around their homes. Dirt, sawdust, wood shavings, various small animal beddings, pet chicken feed, sand, and moss have all been used. However, concerns with smell, dust, parasites, and other problems do not make these items good long-term solutions for cats.</p><p>A final, and important, consideration to make when choosing a litter is whether or not your cat likes it and will use it. Many cats will refuse to use some kinds of litter and will instead go outside the litter box. This, of course, is not ideal for anyone, so the ultimate factor in deciding what kind of cat litter to purchase may lie with your cat and its preferences.</p><h2>Clay Litter</h2><p>Clay cat litter is the most popular litter choice for cat owners, probably in part because it is also one of the most well-established and easy to come by.</p><p>Low dust and dust-free options are available along with scented or unscented varieties. Some of these litters are made up of large pieces of clay and others are finer clay particles, but they all absorb urine and turn into a softer, wet cement-like texture when they do. There are even clay litters that contain attractants to entice a difficult cat to use the litter box more.</p><p>There are two main types of clay cat litter: clumping and non-clumping. Clumping cat litter is often preferred by many cat owners who like to scoop the urine waste out of the litter box regularly, but others like the lower cost of non-clumping litter and will dump the entire litter box contents when necessary.</p><p>Some disadvantages of clay litter include the fact that it is not environmentally friendly, the amount of dust that is present, the heavy weight of the litter, and how much the litter tracks through the house. However, the price point and availability of most clay litters still make it a popular choice for cat owners.</p><h2>Silica Gel Litter</h2><p>Growing in popularity, silica gel cat litter is made by several different companies. Most companies advertise that silica gel litter is not as dusty as clay, traps urine without having to scoop it out of the litter, lasts longer than the same amount of clay litter, offers excellent odor control, and is sometimes even preferred by cats over clay litter.</p><p>Silica get litter is usually more expensive than a clay litter bag of the same weight, but since it lasts longer, some pet owners do not see a significant price difference. Some types of silica gel litters, like Pretty Litter, even have color-changing indicators in them to help monitor a cat's urinary system health.</p><h2>Pine Litter</h2><p>Pine litter is popular because of its natural ability to fight off odors. Being made from pine trees, it is also lightweight, has low dust, is absorbent, and is softer than clay litter.</p><p>Some cat owners like the fact that it is more environmentally friendly than clay litter and that it could provide better odor control. There are both clumping and non-clumping options available. Non-clumping pine litter typically comes in a cylindrical pelleted form while the clumping form is a ground-up pine litter that looks more like sawdust.</p><h2>Wheat Litter</h2><p>Similar to pine litter, wheat litter is also an environmentally friendly alternative to clay litter, but it is made from processed wheat. It clumps, helps control odors, and is even flushable. There are not usually any added dyes or perfumes to this ground-up, granular product. When a cat urinates on wheat litter, it turns to a sawdust-like material and can be scooped out of the box.</p><h2>Grass Litter</h2><p>Less commonly available than most of the other types of cat litter, grass litter is another natural alternative to traditional clay cat litter. It looks similar to pine or corn litter and is a dried, biodegradable, grass seed litter. It clumps so that waste can be scooped out and typically does not contain dyes or added chemicals that some cat owners try to avoid. It is also naturally low-dust and softer and lighter than clay litter.</p><h2>Corn Litter</h2><p>Another natural cat litter option is corn litter. It may come in a scented variety but it is still a biodegradable option. It clumps and absorbs urine, is lightweight when compared to clay litter, and is composed of dried corn kernels. There are even some corn litter options that contain cat attractants.</p><p>Some concerns with corn litter include mold growth, specifically aflatoxins, since corn can easily produce this type of toxin, and decreased clumping capabilities. Aflatoxins can be deadly to pets, so while some companies guarantee their litters are safe and most owners have never had an issue with corn litter, some pet owners choose other options. The lower level of clumping of corn litter has also been discussed among cat owners, but most still consider it functional.</p><h2>Walnut Shell Litter</h2><p>Natural cat litter options have expanded to include walnut shell litters. These ground-up walnut shells have high absorbency when compared to clay litter, work well for odor control, and clump too. Low dust makes this type of natural cat litter extra appealing but some brands seem to give off red or brown dust depending on how much a cat likes to kick it around.</p><p>Granular in appearance, walnut shell cat litters are low-tracking and biodegradable. Some cat owners even feel this type of litter lasts longer than the others they've tried in multiple cat households.</p><h2>Paper Litter</h2><p>Popular for cats with injuries to their paws, paper litter can be processed, recycled paper material, or simply shredded newspaper. These litters have little dust or concern for irritating wounds, no fragrances, are softer than clay litters, and are absorbent. Unfortunately, these litters do not clump or control odors very well though so they are often only used short-term.</p>",1065
50,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cats-tracking-poop-553999,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Litter Box Training,<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Tracking Litter and Poop</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Your Cat From Tracking Litter and Poop</h1><h2>Cats sometimes do their business outside the box</h2><p>Cats are fastidiously clean animals. They constantly groom themselves, don't like to be wet or dirty, and bury their waste matter when they use the litter box. But sometimes cats end up tracking their litter and poop outside of their box. Thankfully there are a few things you can do to keep the mess to a minimum.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Track Litter and Feces?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why your cat might track litter and feces. Some of these problems are easier to resolve than others.</p><p>Kittens learn many behaviors by watching their mothers and litter-mates. Bottle-fed kittens and young rescue kittens miss out on being properly taught how to use a litter box. Many simply benefit from a quick poop-covering lesson. When your cat is in its box, gently take its paws and show it how to cover its poop.</p><h2>Medical Issues</h2><p>If a cat is in pain it can have difficulty entering or exiting a litter box, or pain covering up its waste. Declawing is an example of a surgery that causes both acute and chronic limb pain in a cat, resulting in reluctance to use its paws or legs to cover poop.</p><p>Arthritis, hip dysplasia, or other chronic ailments make it uncomfortable for cats to jump in an out of litter boxes, cover their poop, or self-groom. Talk to your vet if you think your cat is in pain. They can prescribe pain medications or suggest environmental modifications to help your painful cat use their box. For example, switching the location of your cat's box could make it easier for them to use it. Litter boxes with ""walk up"" entrances, or low-bottomed entryways are easier for cats to use than boxes they have to hop in and out of.</p><h2>Litter Box Issues</h2><p>Cats are notoriously fastidious and many will not use a litter box that is less than pristine.</p><p>You should have one more litter box than you do cats. This means if you have one cat, you should have two boxes; or if you have two cats, you should have three litter boxes. Boxes should also be placed far enough away from each other that the cat can only see the litter box it's using.</p><p>If you determine your cat has an issue with the litter box, chances are you can put a stop to any poop tracking.</p><h2>Tips for a Cleaner Litter Box</h2><p>A clean litter box means no poop can be tracked around the house. Some people have success stacking a few litter boxes of the same size on top of each other, with holes in alternating places along the bottom of the box.</p><p>When you lift the top box, clean litter is sifted into the box below. You can dump waste collected in the top box into the trash. You then replace the empty litter box on the bottom of the stack, making sure the holes in the bottom of the box are not in the same location as the box immediately on top. For some people, this is a quick alternative to scooping a box. Automatic litter boxes can scare a cat and cause litter box avoidance.</p><p>Simple rugs can help keep litter and poop from being tracked throughout your house and there are even specially designed mats that help catch the litter particles. Place one of these mats at the edge of your cat's litter box so that they will walk on it when they exit their litter box.</p><p>Some types of litter are designed to help keep litter tracking to a minimum. If your cat is not particular to the litter you are currently using, consider trying one of these products. Different pet brands offer litter that isn't made from clay and might be the solution to your litter problems.</p><h2>Get a Larger Litter Box</h2><p>Litter boxes sold in pet stores are often designed for kittens or small cats, not large, full-grown adult cats. If your cat is having trouble finding the right spot in its small litter box, hanging over the edge to eliminate its waste matter, or you are finding urine or feces on the side of the box or outside it, you probably need a larger litter box.</p><p>Storage containers, utility tubs, kiddie play pools, and sandboxes all can be used as large litter boxes. Don't feel restricted to what the pet store has available. If you can put litter in it and your cat can easily get into it, then you can use it as a litter box.</p><h2>Trim the Fur on Your Cat's Feet</h2><p>Long-haired cats often have a lot of fur in between their toes. If you can keep the fur on their feet trimmed, this means less material for litter and poop to stick to.</p><h2>Stool Consistency</h2><p>Cat poop should be formed, firm, and consistent. If it is watery or especially soft, talk with your vet about your cat's poop consistency.</p><p>Soft stools and diarrhea could indicate a health problem such as inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal parasites, food allergy or other issue. Dietary changes, certain cat foods, and stress can also cause loose stools in your cat. Any of these conditions can cause stool to be softer than normal and contribute to poop being tracked around the house. Formed, normal cat stool is more difficult to make a mess of than diarrhea.</p><h3></h3>",883
51,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-sleeping-in-litter-box-4797034,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Litter Box Training,<h1>Why Is My Cat Sleeping in Their Litter Box?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is My Cat Sleeping in Their Litter Box?</h1><h2>Learn whether the issue is medical or behavioral</h2><p>Cats can sometimes be found napping in some of the strangest locations. What if your cat has taken a sudden liking to napping in her litter box, though? There are medical reasons as well as behavioral reasons for a cat to suddenly start lounging where they go to the bathroom. Your vet can help you figure out the underlying reason for your cat's questionable choice in sleeping arrangements.</p><h2>Medical Causes</h2><p>In the world of pet care, a behavioral reason for anything is a diagnosis of exclusion. This means that all possible medical reasons be ruled out first. Cats can get urinary tract infections, urinary crystal formation, and bladder stones frequently, so any urinary related symptoms you are seeing at home are medical in origin until proven otherwise. Urinary tract infections and urinary crystals or stones can make the lining of the bladder so inflamed that even the smallest amount of urine collecting in the bladder can make your cat feel like she has to urinate right then. A cat with a severe UTI or urinary crystals may lounge in her litter box simply because she feels like she has to use the box so frequently.</p><p>Sometimes a urinary crystal or stone can become lodged in your cat's urethra, causing an obstruction. These cats will go to the box frequently, trying to urinate but producing nothing and will cry or yowl with discomfort. This is life-threatening and a medical emergency. You should take your cat to your vet or a 24 hour emergency hospital immediately if you suspect your cat has a urethral blockage.</p><p>To rule out medical reasons for your cat sleeping in her litter box your vet will want to check her urine, an x-ray and/or ultrasound, and a blood panel. A urine test will show if there are any bacteria or crystals in your cat's urine causing a UTI. Imaging, such as an x-ray or ultrasound, will show bladder stones. Some stones can form without forming crystals in the urine and sometimes crystals in the urine won't aggregate into a stone, so it is important for your cat to have an x-ray or an ultrasound regardless of what the urine tests showed.</p><p>A blood panel will give insight into how your cat's kidneys are functioning. If your cat has early renal disease, an affliction common in senior kitties, she may start to urinary more frequently. There are also other disease processes unrelated to the urinary tract that can cause your cat to drink more and urinate more. Diabetes, for example, can be common in older cats and diabetic cats will have increased drinking and urination. A blood panel will check your cat's glucose levels and a urine test will check for the presence of glucose and ketones in the urine. An elevated blood glucose, especially in combination with glucose and ketones in your cat's urine are indicative of diabetes.</p><p>When it comes to house cats that is, those cats that are actually living in a home and not an animal shelter, animal hospital, or boarding facility a medical cause is going to be the most likely reason for litter box napping. If your vet has checked your cat's urine, blood, and images and everything comes back normal, though, then the reason for your cat's litter box naps truly is behavioral.</p><h2>Behavioral Causes</h2><p>A cat that finds herself under excess stress may hunker down in her litter box because it is a convenient place to hide, it makes them feel more secure, and because it smells like them and is, thus, familiar to them. Things like giving them a cozy box with blankets and pheromones to nap in instead of the litter box may be all these cats need.</p><p>Offer your cat a variety of beds and blankets to choose from. Some cats may like a bed that is a cubby-style versus your average, run-of-the-mill pet bed. Other, older cats may appreciate a more joint-friendly bed. One that utilized memory foam may be just what they are looking for. Just with dogs (and people) cats can get arthritis as they age. The most common locations for your senior or mature adult cat to have arthritis are her hips, back legs, and tail  all things she would use for jumping! So even if you have perfectly suitable beds, they may no be accessible to her anymore. If your cat has suddenly snubbed her longtime favorite bed on the back of the couch for her litter box, it may be simply because she can't to her favorite bed anymore. Try moving her bed to a lower location and add some feliway, catnip, or silver vine to pique her interest.</p><p>Cats can curl up for a nap in seemingly bizarre locations and in impossibly uncomfortable looking positions. If your cat has taken a sudden liking to her litter box, though, there are things you can do to help coax her out of her smelly sleeping location. Your veterinarian can help you figure out the best way to help you cat out of the box and back into her bed.</p>",851
52,https://www.thesprucepets.com/keep-cats-out-of-sandbox-554840,Cats > Cat Behavior & Training > Litter Box Training,<h1>How to Stop Cats From Using a Sandbox as a Litter Box</h1>,"<h1>How to Stop Cats From Using a Sandbox as a Litter Box</h1><p>If cats are using your child's outdoor sandbox as a litter box, then you have a few options for stopping the behavior. For instance, you can put up a barrier, use cat deterrents, or consider keeping your cat inside if your cat is the culprit. It's not an easy task, but the one thing you don't want to do is ignore the problem because it can pose a danger to the children who play in the sandbox.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Use a Sandbox as a Litter Box?</h2><p>In the wild, cats naturally excrete in soft or sandy soil to facilitate easy burial. They use their paws in a backward sweeping motion to cover their feces. In the backyard, the sandbox is a natural outlet for this instinct in cats who pass through or hang out in your yard. It isn't that much different from your cat's indoor litter box.</p><p>If you don't stop cats from defecating in the sandbox, though, it can be harmful to people. During playtime, children may be exposed to parasitic diseases such as round worms andtoxoplasmosis that can be carried in cat feces. Most cats that have parasites don't show any symptoms either. And even if your cat is healthy, you can't account for strays or your neighbors' outside cats that may be carrying these diseases.</p><h2>How to Stop Cats From Eliminating in a Sandbox</h2><p>While the cause behind this behavioral issue is simple, the solution isn't. Every cat is different, so you might have to try a few deterrents or combinations of deterrents before you find a solution that works in your situation. This is especially true if you're dealing with stray or neighborhood cats whose behavior you can't control.</p><h2>Clean It Up</h2><p>It's plain unsanitary and disgusting to have cat fecesor urine in a sandbox that kids play in, and the odor may attract more cats to your yard. Clean it up ASAP by removing the contaminated sand, scrubbing the sandbox with a mixture of 3/4 cup household bleach to each gallon of water, and letting it dry completely before refilling it with fresh, clean sand.</p><h2>Cover the Sandbox</h2><p>The easiest solution to keeping cats out of your kid's sand is to make it a habit to cover the sandbox whenever children aren't playing in it.</p><p>A store-bought sandbox may come with a cover that's designed to keep rain and animals out when it's not in use. You can also fashion a homemade cover using wood, lattice or screening, or heavy outdoor fabrics.</p><h2>Employ Sprinklers</h2><p>Installing a device such as a motion-sensitive water sprinkler is another way to keep animals away. These are often used for gardens, so you can usually find them in the gardening section of hardware or big-box stores.</p><p>If you put a sprinkler right next to the sandbox, the cats will likely get the message. A disadvantage of this method is that, depending on the direction of the spray, it may also get the sandbox wet.</p><h2>Use Natural Deterrents</h2><p>There are several natural deterrents that you can use around the sandbox to discourage cats from entering. Any of these substances either used alone or combined with others can make for an anti-kittycocktail that's not harmful to animals or people. You will, however, need to reapply them frequently as their potency fades due to rain, sun, and wind.</p><h2>Spray Store-Bought Repellents</h2><p>A variety of commercial sprays designed as cat repellents are also commonly used by gardeners. They contain preparations that are offensive to cats but not harmful to either cats or children. Do be sure to carefully read and follow the manufacturer's directions on the product label.</p><p>This type of spray may be effective when applied around the border of a sandbox. Rain and sunlight will dissipate the spray over time, so you'll need to reapply frequently.</p><h2>Transition Your Cat to Indoor Only</h2><p>If your cat seems to be the cause of the sandbox mess, you might need to transition it to being an indoor-only cat. To start the process, provide the cat with at least two litter boxes inside the house and train it to use them. The rule of thumb is one box per cat, plus one extra in the beginning. Once the cat is trained, you can drop down to one box.</p><h2>Supervise Your Cat's Outdoor Time</h2><p>If your yard is safe from your cats and predators and other cats can't get in, you can still let your cat outside periodically, but this will only work if you're able to supervise the cat at all times. You can even teach your cat ways to play outside; similar to their canine counterparts, some cats love to play fetch.</p><p>Whenever you notice your cat heading toward the sandbox, pick it up and move it elsewhere. Use your disciplinary tone and find some sort of distraction that's more tempting than the sand. Eventually, your cat will learn to stay away from the sandbox.</p>",808
53,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-weight-loss-tips-5094380,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness,<h1>7 Ways To Help Your Cat Lose Weight</h1>,"<h1>7 Ways To Help Your Cat Lose Weight</h1><p>Cats who are a healthy weight are happier, more agile, and tend to live longer. Obesity, which is generally viewed as 20 percent or more above normal weight, is the most frequently observed nutritional disorder in domestic cats and, in many cases, this is preventable!</p><h2>Why a Healthy Weight is Important for your Cat?</h2><p>Obesity can result in a reduced quality of life. Overweight cats tend to physically interact less with their families and are often less energetic, less playful, and more lethargic.</p><p>They can also have an increased risk of developing a number of serious health conditions, including those listed below.</p><h2>Causes of Cat Obesity</h2><p>Similar to humans, there are a variety of causes and contributing factors to obesity in cats, it isn't always as simple as just overfeeding. It 's important to identify if there are potential underlying medical causes for obesity prior to beginning a weight loss program.</p> <h2>How To Help Your Cat Lose Weight</h2><p>Managing a weight loss programme for a cat usually involves a multifaceted approach, typically in conjunction with veterinary professionals.</p><p>A healthy plan won't offer any quick fixes and it will involve you adjusting routines in and around the house to best support your cat. Some of the top tips for helping your cat to shed the pounds are detailed below.</p><h3>1. Rule Out Underlying Medical Conditions</h3><p>The most important aspect of any weight loss journey is to first establish if there are any underlying medical conditions that could be contributing to your cat's weight gain. Ruling out, identifying, and treating problems associated with weight gain is paramount.</p><h3>2. Listen to Your Vet's Advice</h3><p>If you haven't noticed your cat putting on a few pounds here and there, don't take offence if, at their annual exam, your vet comments that they could do with shedding a few pounds. Your vet knows what they are talking about and you should heed their advice.</p><p>If no underlying causes for your cat's weight gain are apparent, your vet will typically recommend an overall suggested weight loss to work towards gradually. In extreme cases, they may recommend a special prescription weight-loss diet. Regular weigh-ins at their clinic to monitor progress may also be suggested.</p><h3>3. Consider What Your Are Feeding Your Cat</h3><p>The quality of over-the-counter cat foods varies dramatically. Some can have unnecessary added sugars, others are particularly high in fat.</p><p>Canned food is lower in calories than dry kibble, contains a large amount of water, is easier for your cat to digest, and many cats enjoy it. Some owners choose to switch to feeding a larger proportion of wet food in comparison to dry as part of the programme. There are also over-the-counter weight-loss diets available in pet stores. These are not designed to have a miraculous effect and measuring of quantities is still required, but they can help in a small way.</p><p>Take a look at what you are currently feeding your cat and make a gradual change over if you discover it is not as healthy as you thought. Your vet or a qualified pet nutritionist can offer additional advice if needed.</p><h3>4. Measure Out Your Cat's Daily Food Allowance</h3><p>A very common cause of cats being overweight is simply them being overfed. A great starting point is to begin by measuring their daily portions with a cup or scales.</p><p>Transition away from free feeding, which is leaving food out all the time, and gradually move towards scheduled feedings. When there 's a bottomless bowl of food you have no way of monitoring how much each cat is eating. It may seem convenient at first, but it is a leading cause of obesity.</p><p>As you make the transition away from free-feeding start by doing more frequent, scheduled, smaller meals and making a big announcement when it 's mealtime so the kitties can get used to the new routine. You could also consider using an automatic feeder that dispenses a measured amount of food at pre-programmed times.</p><p>Creating individual feeding stations for your cats can be helpful as well. Cats are not big fans of eating together, can have resource guarding issues, and mealtime should not be a stressful experience.</p><h3>5. Daily Play Sessions For Increased Exercise</h3><p>In addition to monitoring calorie intake and providing quality nutrition, exercise is crucial to a healthy weight for your cat. There are lots of options for upping the exercise of cats - even if they don't venture outdoors.</p><p>Exercising their prey drive with interactive play is a crucial part of your cat 's development and contributes greatly to their quality of life. It is also a wonderful way to exercise your cats.</p><p>Scheduled playtimes occur within the same hour or two every day and provide your cat with structure and a consistent schedule. It is a good idea to have a variety of interactive toys available at all times, and some that are kept specially for play sessions.</p><p>Having two or three wand or mouse on a string toys that only come out during these times will help to keep them novel and fun. These are great for simulating prey and help tap into your cat's natural drives.</p><p>It's really important to let your cat ""catch"" their prey during the play session. Otherwise, they will get frustrated and either stop playing with you or act out in response to her unfulfilled urges. If you play with a laser pointer, be sure to have some kitty play sessions with a toy she can catch, too.</p><h3>6. Use Puzzle Toys and Feeders</h3><p>Puzzle feeders help to slow down greedy eaters, prevent boredom, and can provide additional exercise. They allow cats to eat more instinctively by allowing them to forage and huntfor their food.</p><p>There are various food dispensing toys for cats that you can purchase, and you can even make your own. Start with an easy puzzle and work up to more difficult types based on your individual cat 's preference.</p> <h3>7. Regularly Assess Progress</h3><p>Keep a written log of food intake (including all treats), exercise, and weekly weight. Weigh your cat on the same scale at the same time of day every week. It is sometimes helpful to plot out this information (dates and weights) on a graph.</p><p>Remember, you may hit 'plateaus' in which your cat seems stuck at a certain weight. This is common. Do not despair, but continue with the weight reduction program, making sure no one in the household is 'cheating.'</p><p>Typical minimum weight loss per month for a healthy adult act is 0.5-lbs. Ideally, your cat will lose close to one pound per month. Some cats may need to go slower, while others may shed the pounds more quickly.</p>",1089
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/normal-temperature-for-cats-3384948,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness,<h1>Cat Health: What Is Considered Normal?</h1>,"<h1>Cat Health: What Is Considered Normal?</h1><h2>Cat Health For All Stages of Their Life</h2><p>Become familiar with what is normal for your cat's life stage, so you can anticipate what changes to expect as they grow older. Being aware of life stage changes can help you stay on top of your pet's health and keep them happy and healthy throughout their lifetime. Here's what to expect and what steps you should take as a cat owner in each life stage.</p><h2>Kittens</h2><p>As expected, kittens are packed with all the curious energy their little bodies can contain! A rule of thumb is that the first year of life is devoted to kittenhood and after they become full-fledged cats. By 12 weeks old a kitten begins losing their baby teeth and by 9 months old a kitten will have their full set of 30 adult teeth.</p><p>At each veterinary visit during kittenhood your pet should have their heart listened to as part of their physical exam. While not as common as in puppies, kittens can have heart murmurs or abnormal blood flow sounds, and your vet will want to monitor the murmur to make sure it is not increasing in severity. Heart murmurs heard past 4 months of age may be investigated further by a veterinary cardiologist to make sure your cat does not need any early interventions or specialized care.</p><p>With boundless energy and curiosity, kittens should be engaging with family members daily and explore their surroundings with (sometimes) mischievous vigor! Interact with your kitten in fun ways by using extension toys that allow you to play at a distance and minimize confusion for your kitten. While it is completely natural for kittens to pounce and bite hands and feet, mimicking what they would do to prey, in a home setting you want to separate that confusion and use your hands for gentle pets while the toys sustain pouncing and swatting. Make sure your kitten has elevated resting spots, hiding spots where they can retreat to and feel safe, and food, water, and litter boxes - ideally all in separate areas that are quiet and have low foot traffic.</p><p>With all the development in the first year expect a vigorous appetite for most kittens. A sudden decline in appetite or energy levels warrants a trip to the vet to make sure there are no major issues. One of the most common reasons kittens can become lethargic is from eating an object they had played with such as string or plastic. If you suspect your kitten has eaten a toy or some other object, always steer on the side of caution and take them to the vet to make sure there isn 't a blockage.</p><h2>Adult Cats</h2><p>Cats become adults from 1 to 10 years old. Typically most cats are done physically growing around one year of age but certain large breeds, like Maine Coons, may not physically mature until two years old.</p><p>A growing problem most adult cats face is obesity from overeating and lack of exercise. Your vet may recommend measuring out food and limiting treats- every calorie counts! Still engage your cat with play and provide enrichment opportunities for them to work out. While some may think of cats as lazy, they are great problem solvers and puzzle feeders can help them burn a few calories and also keep them mentally engaged.</p><p>The adult life stage is typically the longest life stage we will see our pets in with the average lifespan being 15 years. Preventative care including annual vet visits is important for all adult cats, even indoor cats.</p><h2>Senior Cats</h2><p>A cat reaches their senior milestone at age 11 and remains there until 14. One of the biggest differences for caring for senior cats is that all seniors should receive twice a year vet visits and baseline lab work to check organ function, abnormalities in blood cells, and monitor thyroid levels. While they may not be receiving vaccinations at every exam, as they age things can progress quickly, and staying on top of any minor issues can help prevent more down the road.</p><p>Extra considerations regarding arthritis and dental disease should be noted for all seniors. Signs of arthritis can include a reluctance to jump up or down from favorite spots or a newfound reluctance to being pet in certain areas that once were not a problem. Adapting to more gentle pets can be in order for senior cats. The once agile and graceful cat may be a bit slower moving than previous years but that is to be expected to a certain degree.</p><p>A change in appetite may also happen, whether due to dental disease, decreased scent receptors, or gastrointestinal changes. Dental disease is extremely common in senior cats. Those 30 teeth are lasting a lifetime and old age can test its limits. Cats may need to switch to a canned version to make eating more comfortable but at your biannual vet visits, your vet can discuss if dentistry can improve your cat's comfort.</p><h2>Geriatric Cats</h2><p>Cats that have reached the milestone of 15 and beyond are bestowed as geriatric. Their considerations are as senior cats but amplified. Changes that are less specific can be how older cats communicate with you and interact with their environment. Is your cat more vocal than in previous years? Naturally fastidious groomers, older cats may become unkempt for a number of reasons. Arthritis can prevent a cat from doing its usual acrobatics in grooming. If you assist with grooming, be very gentle as aging skin is more fragile, and slicker brushes that were used in years gone by may cause discomfort or even injury now.</p><p>Cognitively, just like in people, older cats can have memory and recognition changes that impact their daily life. Cats may not adapt to new household changes as well as when they were younger. Try and keep consistent placements for their necessities and familiar items like their bed and toys.</p><p>Cats sleep on average 15 hours a day and are typically awake at dusk and dawn, their natural hunting schedule. Fortunately, most people develop routines for feeding, playing, and socializing with their pets in the evening and this serves as a great time to do a daily nose-to-tail once over.</p><p>Taking note of your pet's routines at all life stages can be great for comparison if you notice changes in energy, litter box habits, eating habits- whether eating more voraciously and begging for food or eating less, and engagement levels among others. Cats are the world 's masterminds at hiding pain or discomfort so trust intuition if you feel there is something offwith your cat and have them examined by your vet.</p>",1100
55,https://www.thesprucepets.com/upper-body-of-a-healthy-cat-555010,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness,<h1>Signs Your Cat Has a Healthy Upper Body</h1>,"<h1>Signs Your Cat Has a Healthy Upper Body</h1><p>The well-toned upper body of a healthy cat will give the impression of supple strength, which in movement translates to speed, agility, and grace. To see a cat crouched down on the hunt for prey, and moving in a slow motion ""crawl"" is poetry in motion. His frame is aligned perfectly, and every muscle, tendon, and bone move in tandem.</p><h2>The Muscular-Skeletal Structure of a Healthy Cat</h2><p>Standing at rest, in profile, a healthy cat will look evenly balanced. His head will be held high, supported by his neck and strong shoulder muscles. His rib cage encloses and protects the heart, lungs, liver, and gallbladder. At a healthy weight, a cat's ribs may be felt, but are not prominently visual. The bone structure is covered and supported by systems of muscles, ligaments, and tendons, which work together to give the healthy cat's limbs strength, mobility, and speed.</p><h2>The Front Legs and Feet of a Healthy Cat</h2><p>The front legs of a healthy cat are used for balance, running, climbing, and catching prey. The elbows are held close to the body while standing and thrust forward when walking. When a cat is stretching laterally or scratching a scratching post vertically, the front legs may be fully extended, forming an almost straight line.</p><h2>Walking Pattern of a Healthy Cat</h2><p>Unlike humans who walk on the heels and balls of our feet, cats walk on their toes with the ""heel"" never touching the ground, which makes them digitigrade mammals. Dogs and horses are also mammals; animals who walk on the whole sole of the foot, including humans, rabbits, and bears, are called mammals. Cats have a unique way of walking, by moving the front and back legs forward in parallel tandem. This is an instinctive protective measure, which leaves a much smaller and quieter track, making it harder for predators to scent and follow.</p><h2>Cats' Front Toes and Claws</h2><p>A healthy cat usually has ten toes in front. The exceptions are polydactyl cats, often called ""Hemingway Cats,"" which have multiple toes. Cats' toes are very strong; they use them to grip and hold surfaces when climbing, to pull their body upward. A cat chasing a rubber ball (or a mouse) can easily catch it with his toes, then hold it by curling his toes and claws inward.</p><p>The cat's claws are an integral part of his feet. They are the original ""multi-use tool,"" invaluable for climbing; capturing and killing prey; and for protection from predators and other enemies. A cat's claw consists of the sharp, visible nail portion, covered with a disposable sheath; connected to the P3 toe bone with ligaments and tendons. To keep his claws sharp, a cat scratches rough surfaces, such as trees, wood posts, sisal, and sometimes furniture or carpeting. The clawing does not actually sharpen the claw as much as dislodging the protective transparent sheath. You may occasionally find these abandoned sheaths on the floor.</p><h2>Scratching: Healthy Exercise for Cats</h2><p>Observe a cat using a tall scratching post. He will stretch his spine and forelegs to the top of the post, hook his claws into the substrate, and pull strongly downward. This activity combines two kinds of exercise: a range of motion and resistance, and builds strong, supple muscles and healthy joints and tendons.</p><h2>Declawing a Healthy Cat</h2><p>Sometimes cat owners who worry about their cat clawing furniture think declawing is the logical solution. Some veterinarians agree; others buy into the ""otherwise we'll put the cat to sleep"" argument. Some veterinarians even offer to declaw routinely, as a ""combo"" with a spay/neuter surgery, under the premise that the cat only needs to be anesthetized once.</p><p>Many people (this writer included) believe that declawing is an inhumane procedure, with no redeeming value to the cat; unlike spay/neutering, which both provide medical as well as social benefits. Take a look at the accompanying image. Now imagine chopping off those entire first toe joints with a guillotine. That is what declawing is about: a completely unnecessary surgery, especially when there are so many humane alternatives. Occasionally, a medical professional might advise ""getting rid of the cat"" or declawing it to an immunocompromised person. No two such cases are alike and everyone must make his own choices. In my opinion, that is one of the only legitimate reasons for declawing (The other is emergency surgery to repair a badly injured foot.)</p><h2>A Healthy Cat's Coat</h2><p>Whether you call it ""hair"" or ""fur,"" a healthy cat's coat should be clean, shiny, and free of mats. You can help keep your cat's coat shiny with a healthy diet. A cat fed a diet of ""grocery store"" food will often develop a dry, coarse-looking coat. I've read story upon story of the amazing change in cats' coats after a few weeks of eating premium cat food. All of the ""coat supplements"" in the world will not compare to the every-day feeding of a superior diet.</p><h2>Hairballs, Mats, and Grooming</h2><p>Unless a cat travels the show circuit, he will rarely require human assistance with bathing. Cats do an admirable job of keeping their coats clean with frequent, short grooming sessions throughout the day. The barbs on their tongues act as fine-toothed combs, and both clean the individual hairs, but also pull loose hairs out, helping to prevent mats. Unfortunately, those loose hairs are often swallowed by the cat and can clump together forming nasty hairballs, which can lead to bowel obstruction, if not prevented. Hairballs tend to develop more often in longhair cats or cats with dense undercoats, although no cat can be truly free of them.</p><h2>Unsightly, Painful Mats</h2><p>Occasional small mats can be quickly dealt with if you catch them early enough. Here's how to de-mat a cat. Large hair mats can develop quickly in older arthritic cats who can't easily groom certain areas of their bodies. Mats are not only aesthetically unpleasing, but they are also downright painful for these cats. They pull against the skin, making it painful for a cat to lie down in a normal position. If you've somehow missed seeing these mats, the sight of an older cat sleeping sitting up is a red flag for possible mats. They are not only painful but provide a breeding ground for fleas, skin irritation, even fungus infections.</p>",1033
56,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rear-quarters-of-a-healthy-cat-554855,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness,<h1>How to Tell If Your Cat's Rear Quarters Are Healthy</h1>,"<h1>How to Tell If Your Cat's Rear Quarters Are Healthy</h1><p>The profile of the rear quarters of a healthy cat should give the impression of strength and support. The body profile will taper down slightly toward the tail end, while remaining well-muscled, particularly around the haunches. A slight belly pouch is normal, although it is more prominent in heavier cats, or in obese cats who have lost weight. The haunches and back legs are sturdy, poised for running or jumping. The entire rear quarters are covered with fur, which may be sparser in the very last part of the tummy. When walking or running, the rear limbs of younger cats should flow smoothly with no evidence of stiffness or pain.</p><h2>Organs in the Lower Body</h2><p>The organs of the abdomen and lower half of the cat include the liver, stomach, spleen, kidneys, bladder, small intestine, colon, and reproductive organs (testicles or uterus). Unlike the upper body of the cat, except for part of the liver, these organs are not protected by the skeleton.</p><p>Cats showing any of the signs above should be taken to their veterinary clinic without delay to ensure proper examination, diagnosis, and treatment.</p><h2>Spinal Column</h2><p>The spinal column runs the entire length of the body, from where it joins the head to the middle of the tail. Also called the spinal canal, it consists of the backbone (vertebral column), which encloses the spinal cord. This spinal cord is the ""message center"" of the body and operates through nerve endings to control the functions of all parts of the body. Nerve endings also convey sensations of feeling, such as heat, cold, and pain. The spinal cord is one of the most important organs of the body.</p><p>The spinal column in a healthy cat is extremely flexible, which allows for the agility for which cats are famous. A falling cat can right itself by twisting its spine to be able to land upright on its feet. The spine of a cat in a relaxed four-legs stance will be fairly straight and parallel to the ground, sloping down slightly from the front shoulders and again toward the base of the tail.</p><h2>Tail</h2><p>The cat's tail is used for balancing and conveys the emotions of a cat at any given time. A rapidly lashing tail means trouble, and it's best to respect that signal.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Never pull a cat by its tail. You can cause serious injury to the cat, which may cause serious injury to yourself. Tail trauma is a veterinary emergency. Some cats have to undergo tail amputation if the injury is severe. Some tail injuries can heal themselves or be surgically repaired. Injuries resulting in paralysis of the tail may be accompanied by fecal and/or urinary incontinence due to damage of the nerve supply to the area.</p><p>Manx cats are born without tails. Some Manx kittens are born with ""Manx Syndrome,"" which is a genetic condition that causes malformation of their spinal cord. This causes neurological signs in the rear limbs as well as urinary and fecal incontinence and in some cases, spina bifida, a more severe deformity of the spinal cord.</p><h2>Back Legs and Feet</h2><p>The rear haunches, back legs, feet, and claws complete the anatomy of the rear quarters. Flexible hips and the strong bones, joints, and powerful musculature of the cat's back legs give enormous strength for both running and jumping, which are essential for catching prey in the wild.</p><p>In older cats ( less than 8 years old), slowness or hesitation in mobility, can be a sign of arthritis, particularly if the cat has difficulty in jumping up on furniture or using their litter box. Excess weight contributes to arthritis, as well as other medical conditions. A program of slow weight loss recommended by your veterinarian is essential for obese cats. Hip dysplasia, which is seen more frequently in certain breeds (Persian, Siamese, and Maine Coon) can predispose cats to arthritis. Your veterinarian can also recommend medications to help soothe sore joints and prevent progression of arthritis. The supplements glucosamine and chondroitin are commonly recommended and are combined in the product Cosequin (R).</p><p>The back legs, paws, and claws are as important as those in the front. Their strength enables the cat to push forward and quickly reach a high speed for pursuing prey or running from predators. The back claws are powerful for delivering painful ""rabbit kicks,"" both in play and in self-protection. Although front claws should be clipped routinely, it is not recommended to clip the back claws of cats that spend time outdoors, because of their use for protection.</p><p>The body of a healthy cat is poetry in motion. It is the perfect balance of form and function, with the bonus of beauty and grace. Your charge when you take cats into your home is to make sure that they receive a wholesome, nutritious diet, an adequate exercise in the form of play, and a planned program of veterinary care, to help ensure that they stay healthy for as long as possible.</p>",824
57,https://www.thesprucepets.com/third-eyelid-in-cats-5072264,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness,<h1>What Is a Third Eyelid in Cats?</h1>,"<h1>What Is a Third Eyelid in Cats?</h1><p>Did you know that cats have more than just two eyelids on each eye? In addition to the upper and lower eyelids, there is a third eyelid that you normally don't see. In some cases, a protruding third eyelid is actually a sign of illness or injury.</p><h2>What Is the Third Eyelid in a Cat?</h2><p>Cats and many other mammals have a third eyelid called the nictitating membrane. This membrane is located in the corner of each eye towards the center of the face. The third eyelid is typically retracted and not visible. Certain situations may cause the third eyelid to protrude and partially cover the eyeball.</p><h2>Reasons for a Cat's Third Eyelid to Appear</h2><p>It is uncommon to see your cat's third eyelids. In many cases, the appearance of the third eyelid indicates that there is something wrong.</p><p>There are several reasons for a protruding third eyelid in cats. Some are considered normal while others are problematic. In general, if you notice your cat's third eyelid protruding for more than a few hours, you should contact your veterinarian.</p><h3>Sleepiness or Relaxed State</h3><p>It is normal for part of the third eyelids to show when a cat is very relaxed or tired. You may notice that the third eyelids are up while your cat sleeps or right after waking. The third eyelid should retract as soon as the cat is awake and alert. If the third eyelid stays up for longer than</p><h3>Sedation or Anesthesia</h3><p>If your cat was given anesthesia or sedation for a medical procedure, the third eyelid will appear and partially cover the eye due to extreme physical relaxation. The effect may last for several hours after waking but should gradually go away. This is considered normal and is not a problem unless the third eyelid remains up after the day of the procedure.</p><h3>Conjunctivitis</h3><p>The conjunctiva is a thin, transparent mucous membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the front part of the eye. Sometimes called ""pink eye,"" conjunctivitis simply means inflammation of the conjunctiva. It may be caused by an infection, allergies, injury, or an eye irritant. It is not uncommon for conjunctivitis to cause inflammation and protrusion of the third eyelid. Cats with conjunctivitis will typically be treated with medicated eye drops or ointment that contain antibiotics and/or steroids.</p><h3>Corneal Ulcers</h3><p>Thecorneais clear and covers the front of the eye, including the iris and pupil. A corneal ulcer is a wound to the cornea that causes pain and inflammation in the eye and may make the third eyelid appear. Corneal ulcers are usually caused by an injury to the eye, like a scrape, scratch, or puncture wound. Irritating or abrasive substances can also cause corneal ulcers. A corneal ulcer can quickly become very serious and requires veterinary treatment. Cats with corneal ulcers often need one or more types of eye medications and possibly oral medications too.</p><h3>Uveitis</h3><p>The uvea is the middle part of the eyeball and contains many blood vessels. Inflammation of the uvea is called uveitis. It often makes the eye appear very red and is sometimes painful. The third eyelid may or may not be affected.</p><h3>Glaucoma</h3><p>Glaucoma is a painful eye condition that causes pressure to build up in the eye. This occurs because the aqueous humor (fluid within the front part of the eye) is unable to drain properly. Excess pressure causes damage to the optic nerve and may result in blindness. Third eyelid inflammation may sometimes accompany glaucoma.</p><h3>Cherry Eye</h3><p>The third eyelid contains a gland that can become swollen and look like a round protrusion from the inner corner of the eye. This is called prolapse of the nictitating membrane, or cherry eye. It is relatively uncommon in most cats but common in Burmese cats. Surgery is the treatment for cherry eye.</p><h3>Eye Growths</h3><p>Growths, tumors, masses, and cysts in and around the eye can lead to inflammation and protrusion of the third eyelid. Contact your vet if you notice an abnormal growth or swelling in or around your cat's eye before it causes more trouble.</p><h3>Horner's Syndrome</h3><p>Horner's syndrome is a neurological disorder that is caused by a dysfunctioning nerve. It affects the eyes and facial muscles, making the eyes appear asymmetrical. The third eyelid is often very prominent in one eye. The eyelids droop and the eye itself appears ""sunken in."" Horner's syndrome may be caused by trauma or a tumor, but sometimes the cause cannot be determined. The condition may resolve on its own.</p><h2>What to Do If You See Your Cat's Third Eyelid</h2><p>If you notice your cat's eyelid protruding, and it doesn't seem to be caused by sleep, relaxation, sedation, or anesthesia, then it probably means there is a problem. Contact your veterinarian as soon as possible to seek advice. If your cat is showing other signs of illness, then it's best to get your cat to the vet for an examination. Do not attempt to put anything in the eye without your vet's recommendation as this can make things much worse. Eye problems can easily go from bad to worse, so do not delay in seeing your vet.</p>",841
58,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lifespan-of-cats-552035,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness,<h1>What Is the Average Lifespan of the Common Cat?</h1>,"<h1>What Is the Average Lifespan of the Common Cat?</h1><p>Cats can live a long time. The average lifespan of a cat is about 15 years, so they often outlive most of our pet dogs. A teenage cat, or even one in their twenties, is not uncommon to see. Many factors can play a role in determining how long your cat might live.</p><h2>History of Domesticated Cats</h2><p>Cats have been kept as pets for thousands of years. Theyoriginate from the Near East countries where they were domesticated from wild cats to help control rodent populations. These cats spread throughout the world as pets, and we eventually started selectively breeding them for specific traits, thus creating different breeds. The primary cat breeds were originally bred using cats from four major regions; the Arabian Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, South Asia, and Western Europe. These four regions have produced cats that have different genetic markers based on what region, or race, they are from.</p><h2>Cat Breeds and Lifespan</h2><p>While it is impossible to know exactly how long a cat will live, some breeds of cats are known to often live longer than others. The Siamese and Manx cat breeds are two that often outlive their cat competition, but other breeds have been recorded as living into their 20s and even 30s. Both purebred and domestic mixed-breed cats have the potential to surpass the average lifespan of the species.</p><h2>Cat Nutrition and Lifespan</h2><p>Cats primarily eat meat, so they are considered obligate carnivores, and this should be reflected in the food we feed them. A lot of research has been done to determine the dietary needs of a house cat, so the food options that are available to cat owners are plentiful.</p><p>But not all foods are created equal. Adult cats cannot digest large amounts of carbohydrates or lactose, so these are unnecessary ingredients in their food. Carbohydrates can even decrease how much protein is digested, so they are, in fact, harmful to a cat. Proteins, on the other hand, are very important to a cat. Cats require a large amount of protein when compared to a dog, due to their unique digestive system. Adult cats should receive at least 5.5 g/kg of protein a day. This means the average eight-pound cat needs to consume at least 20 grams of protein each day and often much more.</p><p>Essential amino acids are also very important to a cat. Taurine, methionine, and cystine are some of these essential amino acids, and without them, important vitamins, and the proper amount of protein, a cat's health may suffer greatly.</p><h2>Cat Health and Lifespan</h2><p>Of course, a cat that doesn't eat a healthy diet may develop health issues, but parasites and diseases can also affect their health. Some diseases have long term effects on cats and may also shorten their lifespan.</p><p>Poor genetics, immune-compromised cats, and cats that have compromised organ functions might not live as long as healthy cats.</p><h2>Cat Lifestyle and Lifespan</h2><p>Some cats are considered indoor pets, others are strictly outdoor pets, and others still will be indoor/outdoor pets that split their time between environments. The daily risks that outdoor cats take are much higher than those of an indoor cat, so the lifespan of an outdoor cat is often cut short. Avoiding getting hit by vehicles, hurt by wild animals and eating toxins, finding food, surviving the elements, and being exposed to various parasites and diseases may all be daily challengesfor an outdoor or indoor/outdoor cat. The more time a cat spends outside, the greater the risk is of an injury or illness from that environment.</p><p>Indoor cats are not exposed to as many risks since they are sheltered inside a secure home. Wild animals and vehicles pose no threats to an indoor cat, their diet is typically controlled, and toxin, parasite, and disease exposures are lessened, especially if they are vaccinated and on preventative medications.</p><p>The same is true for big cats like lions, tigers, ocelots, and other wild cats. These cats that reside in zoos often outlive their wild counterparts.</p><h2>Oldest Cat Recorded</h2><p>Guinness World Records lists the oldest cat as having lived 38 years and three days. Crème Puff was a domestic shorthair cat that was sometimes fed odd things such as asparagus, eggs, and heavy cream. She was born in 1967 and died in 2005 in Austin, Texas. It is unknown exactly how Crème Puff was able to live to be such an old cat, but a combination of loving care, good genetics, and a safe environment were probably key factors.</p><p>While we never have complete control over our cat's lives, we can be sure to offer them a safe, healthy, and loving environment to increase the odds of them living a long life.</p><p>Cozzi, Bruno et al.

But how long does a cat nurse for and when does its milk supply dry up?</p><h2>Cat Pregnancy and Lactation</h2><p>Cats can get pregnant before they are a year of age and are pregnant for about two months. Lactation will begin when they are about to give birth. Cats usually have eight teats and they will all produce milk. Cats that are not pregnant, and sometimes even spayed, can produce milk and this is called a false or pseudopregnancy. Hormones in a cat's body control this production of unnecessary milk. If your cat is not pregnant but is lactating, do not allow it to pretend to nurse items such as toys or socks, as this will prolong the pseudopregnancy.</p><p>Pregnant cats will experience swelling to their teats about halfway through pregnancy but they will not begin to lactate until a few days before they give birth. Their appetite will increase during pregnancy to help provide the extra nutrition that their bodies need to produce milk. Once they give birth, the kittens will need to receive the first milk that the mother cat produces called colostrum. Colostrum is rich in nutrients and antibodies that help support the kittens' immature immune systems.</p><h2>Weaning Kittens</h2><p>Once the kittens have been nursing for about a month, they will begin to wean off of their mother. A liquefied kitten food should be offered to the kittens freely while they still have the ability to nurse from their mother. Over the course of the next 6 weeks, the kittens will slowly eat more kitten food and nurse less. The kitten food will go from a liquid to a watered-down canned food, to regular canned food, then moistened kitten kibble, and finally hard kibble during the weaning time until it is ready to leave its mother at 12 weeks of age.</p><p>You should limit the time a kitten has to nurse the older it gets if it is eating on its own. If a kitten is eating well on its own but still wants to nurse a lot, you will have to restrict the kitten from accessing its mother for part of the day.</p><h2>Cat Milk Supply</h2><p>Adequate nutrition is important for a cat to be able to produce enough milk for all of their kittens. Cats typically have about five kittens per litter but if a cat has an exceptionally large litter it may need supplemental nutrition in order to help its body produce enough milk for its young, or the kittens may need supplementation if they aren't getting enough feeding time with so many litter mates. Cats that are nursing should be fed kitten or growth diets that are rich in calories, fat, and calcium to accommodate the additional stress of feeding kittens and energy requirements of lactation. If you are concerned about the nutritional needs of a mother cat, discuss what you can do with your vet.</p><p>At weeks three or four of nursing, the mother cat is at its most stressful and demanding point of lactation. The mother cat's body has been producing milk continuously for about a month now, but it is also about to slow down. Since the kittens are starting to wean off their mother's milk at this time, less milk will be needed.</p><h2>The End of Lactation</h2><p>Mother cats will continue nursing as long as they have kittens to feed. This is helpful if you have a litter of orphaned kittens that need to be fed and have been abandoned by their mother but it is not necessary if you only have kittens who are now eating solid food.</p><p>Once kittens are eating solid food, they usually don't try to nurse so the milk production will dramatically decrease in the mother cat. The milk should be completely dried up after a couple of weeks but this is a gradual process. The teats will still be swollen initially and produce milk. Then the milk will stop coming, the swelling will decrease, and after one to two weeks, the mammary glands should no longer be swollen under the teats.</p><h2>Problems After Lactation</h2><p>If your mother cat's teats have remained large, red, and swollen after a week of not nursing, you should have your veterinarian take a look at them. Mastitis is a serious and painful condition if left untreated and may require medications.</p><h3>Watch Now: What Is Your Cat Saying to You?</h3>",746

Some conditions may be congenital or inherited, while many others are infectious including viral, bacterial, or parasitic infections. Fortunately, vaccinated kittens are protected from many of the most deadly diseases.</p><p>Feral cat mothers and their kittens may be more at risk for certain health problems.</p><h2>Panleukopenia (Feline Distemper)</h2><p>Panleuk, as it is commonly called, is a highly contagious parvovirus. It is especially dangerous in large groups of unvaccinated cats where it can spread quickly. It targets cells of the bone marrow as well as the cells that line the intestine, which can lead to severe vomiting, diarrhea, dehydration, and sepsis.It is transmitted through bodily secretions and can survive in the environment for a long time. Treating Panleukopenia requires hospitalization with intensive care in most cases, and many cats do not survive. The best approach is prevention and luckily, the vaccine for Panleukopenia is very safe and effective.</p><h2>Upper Respiratory Infections</h2><p>Upper respiratory infections caused by viruses include Rhinotracheitis, a.k.a. Feline Herpes Virus and Feline Calicivirus. There are core vaccines for both of these viruses. These viruses can cause sneezing, nasal discharge, and conjunctivitis (commonly known as pink-eye).They are highly contagious and most cats will be exposed to them at some point. For cats who are already vaccinated, they tend to have milder symptoms if they are exposed later in life.</p><p>Some upper respiratory infections are also caused by bacteria, with the most common causes being , , and species. Cats with bacterial infections tend to have nasal discharge that appears more milky in color due to a combination of pus and mucus. These cats will likely need to be treated with antibiotics. The Chlamydia infections seen in cats is not the same as the sexually transmitted disease of humans, but it can cause conjunctivitis in humans in rare cases.</p><p>Many cats will not need medical treatment if they have symptoms of a respiratory infection, however, if they stop eating, seem to have difficulty breathing, or have signs of conjunctivitis (squinting their eyes, holding their eyes shut, or rubbing at their eyes), they should be examined by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Fading Kitten Syndrome (FKS)</h2><p>FKS is the term used to describe death of a neonatal kitten due to a number of causes. Anyone who has fostered mother cats and kittens, or orphaned kittens who need to be bottle fed, is likely familiar with this syndrome, which may appear shortly after birth or up until kittens are weaned. There is no single cause but many factors which may play a role including infections, congenital abnormalities, being exposed to extreme temperatures (hot or cold), and/or poor nutrition . In many cases the cause is not identified as the kitten may decline rapidly and pass away before any diagnosis can be made.</p><h2>Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)</h2><p>FIV is transmitted by bite wounds (saliva to blood), or during gestation (in-utero) or from nursing mothers to their kittens. The virus is a retrovirus that attacks the immune system. Cats with FIV are more likely to get secondary infections because of their compromised immune systems. Many cats with FIV may live normally for years before they become ill and many studies have shown it does not shorten their lifespan.Cats with FIV may also be more prone to certain dental conditions and should be monitored closely by a vet for this condition. There is a non-core vaccine for FIV that is not appropriate for all cats, however, those at high risk of acquiring FIV including outdoor cats or cats who live with FIV+ cats may benefit from being vaccinated.</p><h2>Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV)</h2><p>FeLV is a retrovirus that is extremely contagious and can be spread through casual contacts, such as shared food dishes or litter boxes, grooming each other, as well as in-utero from a mother cat or during nursing. FeLV suppresses the immune system and causes a number of other syndromes that are nearly always fatal. In some cases cats may have a regressive infection where the virus is not actively replicating and this will cause some tests to become negative. These cats tend to have lower risks of developing FeLV-related diseases, however the virus can become reactivated. There is a non-core vaccine that can be used to prevent FeLV infection and this is most appropriate for outdoor cats who are at high risk of contracting FeLV.</p><h2>Deafness</h2><p>Some kittens are born without hearing, known as congenital deafness. This condition, while incurable, does not limit a cat's quality of life, however owners may notice that a deaf cat will vocalize more loudly, or play more aggressively with other cats. White cats with two blue eyes are at a higher risk of being deaf since these traits are often inherited together.Deaf cats do not require much specialized care, however, owners should be aware that they may startle awake since they won't hear someone approaching, so they should be gently roused. They should not be allowed outside since they cannot hear approaching danger.</p><h2>Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)</h2><p>FIP is a strange disease in that it is a mutated form of a very common infection in cats caused by Feline Coronavirus. Feline Coronavirus is a very common virus in cats and most cats will have very mild symptoms which completely resolve on their own. However, in rare cases, this same Coronavirus can mutate into FIP, which is almost always fatal. Cats who live with many other cats may be more at risk, and certain purebred cats also seem to be more likely to develop FIP including Ragdolls, Abyssinians, Rexes, Himalayans, and Bengals. Symptoms can vary as there are multiple forms of FIP. but many times owners will notice a kitten that is lethargic, not eating much, or losing weight.</p><h2>Hip Dysplasia</h2><p>Hip dysplasia is thought to be a genetic disease, although it does not always show up immediately. It is rare in cats compared to dogs, and it is a deformity that can, in many cases, be corrected through surgery.Many cats with hip dysplasia will not be symptomatic for the disease, and in those cases, no medical intervention may be needed.</p><h2>Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia (FCH)</h2><p>FCH is caused by a neurological birth defect that occurs in-utero. A common cause for this can be feline distemper (Panleukopenia virus), contracted by the mother while she is pregnant, but other exposures can also cause FCH. Kittens with CH usually show signs of an underdeveloped cerebellum including poor balance, tremors, and a wobbly gait. There is no treatment for the condition but many of these kittens learn to compensate very well and can have a good quality of life. The best prevention is to make sure cats are up to date on their vaccines to prevent the spread of Panleukopenia. Pregnant cats should not be vaccinated with a modified live form of the vaccine, however, since this could induce FCH in the kittens.</p><h2>Flea-Transmitted Diseases</h2><p>Several parasites are carriers of dangerous diseases to kittens.</p><h2>Hemotropic Mycoplasmosis</h2><p>Hemotropic Mycoplasmosis, formerly called Hemobartonella, a.k.a. hemobartonellosis, is a parasite of red blood cells that can cause anemia. It is potentially deadly (particularly in kittens), and infected cats may even need blood transfusions as part of the treatment.The exact modes of transmission are not well-understood but it is thought that it can be transmitted through fleas and mosquitos, as well as between mothers and kittens, and through bite wounds.</p><h2>Anemia</h2><p>Even if a kitten doesn't get Hemotropic Mycoplasmosis from fleas, a large enough infestation of fleas dining on the kitten's blood over a period of time can cause a different type of serious anemia if enough blood is lost to the fleas.This condition may also require a blood transfusion in addition to aggressive treatment of the flea infestation.</p>",1283
61,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fiv-in-cats-p2-552157,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Feline immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, is a virus in the same family as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, but it only infects cats. Like HIV in humans, FIV weakens the immune system, making it difficult for the animal to fight off other infections. This can lead to a wide variety of symptoms, such as weight loss, swollen lymph nodes, fever, and diarrhea. However, many cats do not show any symptoms at all.</p><p>While any cat can catch FIV, it is most common in outdoor cats that get into fights with other cats, or in kittens that become infected before birth or from their mother's milk after birth. It is not easily spread between cats sharing the same home.</p><p>Although it can be fatal if left untreated, a positive test for FIV is not a mandatory death sentence for your pet. With a high-protein diet and aggressive treatment of secondary infections, an FIV-positive cat can lead a reasonably normal life for a number of years after diagnosis.</p><h2>What Is Feline Immunodeficiency Virus?</h2><p>FIV is a retrovirus that only affects cats. It can be treated but not cured. As a result, cats with FIV are likely to have a shorter lifespan than healthy cats, but they can still be wonderful pets.</p><p>In the U.S., approximately 1.5 to 3 percent of healthy cats are infected with FIV. Most cats with FIV live outdoors and are thus more likely to experience bites from infected feral cats. FIV cannot be transmitted to human beings.</p><p>Once infected with the virus, cats go through three phases. In the first, called the acute phase, which occurs roughly one to three months after infection, the virus enters the cat's lymph nodes, and from there, penetrates white blood cells. These blood cells are a critical component of the immune system. During the acute phase, the cat might have swollen lymph nodes, a low-grade fever, lethargy, and loss of appetite. These symptoms can be very mild and easily missed by the cat's owner, however.</p><p>During the second phase, called the latent or asymptomatic phase, the virus very slowly replicates within the cat's immune system. However, the infected cat doesn't show outward signs of illness during this phase, although blood tests can be abnormal. The asymptomatic phase can last from months to years. Some cats never progress beyond this phase.</p><p>In the third phase, called the progressive phase, the cat's immune system declines greatly, allowing secondary infections to take hold. Urinary tract infections, skin infections, gum disease, cancer, and upper respiratory infections are all common during this phase, which is sometimes referred to as feline AIDS. Most cats only survive for a few months after reaching this phase.</p><h2>Symptoms of FIV in Cats</h2><p>Symptoms of FIV often don't show up until years after infection. The following are some of the most common symptoms in FIV-positive cats.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>It can be difficult to spot FIV early on, because the symptoms, such as diarrhea, lack of appetite, and low-grade fever, can be mild and easily attributed to other causes. That's why it's so important to take your cat to the vet should it show several signs of illness that last more than a day or two, even if the symptoms are mild.</p><p>In cats that have progressed to full-blown feline AIDS, numerous secondary infections, as well as cancer, are common, although it's important to note that it isn't the FIV itself directly causing the symptoms. The breakdown of the cat's immune system caused by the FIV indirectly leads to the development of secondary health problems and<br />diseases.</p><h3>Weight Loss</h3><p>Because cats with FIV tend to lose their appetites, they usually lose weight. This can be one of the first symptoms you notice.</p><h3>Disheveled Coat</h3><p>Cats with FIV can look a bit ratty. This is partly because they don't pay much attention to grooming themselves when they don't feel good and partly because the various secondary diseases that underlie FIV often cause the skin and fur to be less healthy or even cause fur loss.</p><h3>Lack of Appetite</h3><p>Most cats in the early stages of FIV lose their appetites. You'll notice the food bowl stays full, or your cat stops eating after a few bites. In the last phase of the disease, your cat might once again stop eating due to a secondary infection causing pain, discomfort, or general malaise.</p><h3>Diarrhea</h3><p>In both the first and last phase of FIV, your cat might have soft or watery stools and might pass feces more often than normal. Most healthy cats have only one or two bowels movements per day.</p><h3>Conjunctivitis</h3><p>Conjunctivitis is redness affecting the whites of the eyes. It often occurs in cats who have progressed to the third stage of FIV, as they are prone to eye infections and eye inflammation. It it is not common in cats in the early stages of the disease.</p><h3>Discharge from Eyes or Nose</h3><p>Cats in the last stage of FIV are very prone to upper respiratory infections, which typically present with runny eyes or nose. The discharge can be watery or goopy and you might also see dried crusts around the cat's nose and eyes.</p><h3>Changes in Behavior</h3><p>Cats that don't feel well often become lethargic, meaning that they sleep more than usual or don't seem to have much energy. Your cat might also hide, have little interest in playing or being petted, become irritable, or just seem ""off"" in mood.</p><h3>Urinating Outside the Litter Box</h3><p>Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common in cats that are in the late stage of FIV. Because UTIs are painful and cause the cat to need to urinate more often than normal, your cat might not make it to the litter box in time or might start associating the litter box with pain, thus causing the cat to urinate in other places around your home. You might also notice your cat strains to pass urine, due to the pain and inflammation of the UTI.</p><h2>Causes of FIV</h2><p>A cat generally develops FIV after being bitten by an infected feline, as the virus primarily sheds through the infected cat's saliva. When an infected cat bites a non-infected cat, the virus is injected directly into the non-infected cat's bloodstream. FIV can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected blood. It can also be transmitted from an FIV-positive cat to her kittens during birth or while nursing.</p><p>It's very rare for a cat to develop FIV by sharing food bowls or simply being around an FIV-positive cat, so there's no need to be worried if you have one cat in your household that's FIV-positive and another that's not. However, it's prudent to test all cats in the household if one is diagnosed is FIV, just to be sure.</p><h2>Diagnosing Feline Immunodeficiency Virus in Cats</h2><p>FIV is primarily diagnosed through a blood test called an ELISA test (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). A positive result means that the cat has produced antibodies to FIV and most likely is infected with the virus. However, it can take up to eight weeks after exposure for a cat to test positive, so it is possible to get false-negative results.</p><p>More commonly, a cat can have a false-positive result on the ELISA test if it was vaccinated against FIV, as the vaccination causes the cat to produce antibodies against FIV even though it isn't actually infected with the virus. Young kittens might also have a false-positive result if their mother was infected during pregnancy, as the mother's milk can transfer antibodies to the nursing kittens.</p><p>If your cat has a positive ELISA test, your veterinarian might recommend a second test that is more definitive, called the western blot test or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test.</p>",1260
62,https://www.thesprucepets.com/heart-disease-in-cats-3384855,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Heart Disease in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Heart Disease in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>While heart disease is considered more common in humans and pets like dogs, cats are still susceptible to developing these health concerns. In fact, feline heart disease is often a ""silent"" disease at first because cats are experts at hiding signs of illness. If left untreated, heart disease can cause other serious symptoms in the body and potentially be fatal. Different types of heart conditions can affect many breeds of cats, but some like Maine Coons, American and British Shorthairs, Persian cats, Ragdoll, Sphynx, Burmese, and Siamese cats are more susceptible to certain problems including cardiomyopathy. Heart disease can be present from birth due to heart defects, but it can also be acquired later in life from causes like other feline health problems. If you notice symptoms like lethargy, changes in appetite, breathing problems, pale gums, or even collapse, it's important to take your cat to the veterinarian right away.</p><h2>What Is Heart Disease?</h2><p>The term ""heart disease"" is a general way to describe a number of different disorders that cause abnormal cardiac function and affect the heart. Cats can experience one or more types of heart disease at the same time.</p><p>The heart is divided into four chambers: The left atrium and right atrium are the upper chambers; the right ventricle and left ventricle are the lower chambers. Oxygenated blood from the lungs enters the left side of the heart and is then pumped throughout the body, delivering oxygen to the tissues and cells.</p><p>When any kind of heart disease is present, it affects the heart's ability to properly circulate blood. Heart disease of the muscles can prevent the muscles of the heart from contracting as needed. Valvular heart diseases can make blood flow in the wrong direction.</p><h2>Symptoms of Heart Disease in Cats</h2><p>Heart disease can cause a large variety of symptoms.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Heart Murmur</h3><p>A heart murmur does not always indicate the presence of heart disease in cats (and not all cats with heart disease have murmurs). This occurs due to turbulence in the blood flowing through the heart. A murmur sounds like swishing or whooshing through a stethoscope. This may occur secondary to a heart condition, but it can also be caused by stress. If your vet detects a heart murmur, it's a good idea to do further testing to rule out heart disease.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>If your cat is acting lethargic, it may also be accompanied by symptoms like weakness, exercise intolerance, or even collapse. Heart disease prevents the heart from functioning normally, so any type of physical activity may cause your cat's energy levels to significantly decrease.</p><h3>Changes in Appetite or Weight</h3><p>Your cat may lose its appetite or become anorexic (refusing to eat) when dealing with heart disease. This can also lead to weight loss, which can happen quickly depending on the severity of the condition.</p><h3>Irregular Breathing</h3><p>Labored or rapid breathing is common in cats with heart disease when the heart is unable to transport oxygen normally throughout the body. Shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing may also occur, though coughing is a less common sign of heart disease in cats than in humans or dogs.</p><h3>Pale or Blue Gums</h3><p>Pale gums are a telltale sign of heart disease in cats and many other animals. This is because the heart cannot pump normal levels of blood throughout the body, leading to blood loss in tissues.</p><h3>Arrhythmia</h3><p>Arrhythmia means that your cat's heartbeat is irregular. This can be caused by heart disease, but doesn't necessarily mean that your cat has heart disease. An irregular heartbeat should always be further diagnosed by your veterinarian.</p><h3>Acute Weakness or Paralysis</h3><p>In its hind limbs, your cat may experience acute weakness or paralysis, which is caused by blood clots (thromboembolism). This is a serious sign that can lead to heart attacks.</p><h3>Distended Abdomen</h3><p>Heart disease commonly affects other organs like the liver. This can cause the liver to become enlarged, which in turn makes your cat's abdomen appear swelled (distended).</p><h3>Stunted Growth in Kittens</h3><p>If your kitten is not growing at a normal rate, heart disease may be the underlying reason. Always monitor the growth of kittens with supervision from your veterinarian.</p><h3>Sudden Death</h3><p>Because heart disease can lead to conditions like arrhythmia and blood clots, it's possible for cats with these diseases to experience heart attacks that may be fatal. These serious conditions should always warrant a prompt visit to the veterinarian to begin diagnosis and treatment as early as possible.</p><h2>Causes of Heart Disease</h2><p>Feline heart disease is either congenital (present at birth) or acquired in adulthood. There are many different types of heart disease that affect cats. Some types of heart disease develop secondary to another health condition, while others are hereditary and known to affect certain cat breeds.</p><h3>Congenital Heart Disease</h3><p>Congenital heart defects are uncommon in cats. These disorders may or may not be genetic, and many are discovered during a routine examination or cardiology exam.</p><h3>Acquired Heart Disease</h3><p>Most forms of heart disease in cats are acquired in adulthood. Some develop due to genetic predisposition while others may be connected to other health issues like obesity, hypertension, kidney disease, and hyperthyroidism.</p><p>Most cardiac disorders diagnosed in cats are called cardiomyopathies. The term ""cardiomyopathy"" simply means a disease or disorder of the heart and is used to describe structural or anatomical abnormalities in the heart.</p><h3>Congestive Heart Failure</h3><p>The term ""congestive heart failure"" broadly refers to heart disease that is so severe that the heart is unable to pump blood forward through the body, causing fluid to back up and accumulate in the lungs or abdomen. CHF is a life-threatening condition. Any of the above conditions can lead to CHF in cats.</p><h2>Diagnosing Heart Disease in Cats</h2><p>If your cat has any signs of heart disease, it's important to get to the vet as soon as possible. Your veterinarian will gather information about your cat's history and current clinical signs, then perform a physical examination. If the vet hears a heart murmur or otherwise suspects a heart problem, further testing will be needed.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The appropriate treatment for your cat's heart disease depends on the type and severity of the heart disease. Unless there is a congenital defect that can be corrected with surgery, feline heart disease is typically treated with medication. Medication does not fix a diseased heart but tries to help support the heart and body.</p><p>Your vet may prescribe diuretics to reduce fluid buildup around the lungs or in the abdomen. ACE inhibitors can help relax the blood vessels, enabling the heart to pump blood with less effort and lowering blood pressure. Pimobendan can help improve the force of heart contractions, while blood pressure medications are used when a cat has high blood pressure as this can worsen heart disease. Your veterinarian may also recommend medications to prevent blood clots or supplements such as antioxidants to support cardiac function.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Heart Disease</h2><p>Because there are so many types of heart disease, your cat's prognosis will depend upon the specific condition that is diagnosed. Some forms of heart disease are mild and require only lifestyle changes or medication for the cat to live a happy, healthy life. However, severe forms of heart disease can be life-threatening and require aggressive treatment, and fatalities are still possible.</p>",1180
63,https://www.thesprucepets.com/fatty-liver-disease-in-cats-5070427,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Fatty Liver Disease in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Fatty Liver Disease in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Fatty liver disease or syndrome, more properly known as hepatic lipidosis, is a disease that affects a cat's liver. It is one of the most common acquired liver disease in cats, and it can be life threatening if not treated promptly. Symptoms can include lethargy, loss of appetite, jaundice, weight loss, weakness, and vomiting.</p><p>The majority of cats that develop fatty liver disease are middle-aged, overweight or obese cats that suddenly develop anorexia, or a refusal to eat, due to an underlying illness or extreme stress. The condition can quickly lead to liver failure and death without treatment. With treatment, however, which can be a lengthy process, most cats will recover from the condition.</p><p>Knowing how to recognize the signs of this serious disease, as well as how to prevent it, can help save your cat's life.</p><h2>What Is Fatty Liver Disease?</h2><p>The liver is a vital part of the digestive system. This organ performs a variety of critical functions related to digestion, including processing fats and carbohydrates to make energy, synthesizing proteins and vitamins that are crucial to healthy cellular function, serving as a storage space for vitamins and iron, producing several different hormones, and breaking down toxins in the bloodstream so they can be eliminated from the body.</p><p>When a cat, especially an overweight or obese cat, develops anorexia, or a refusal to eat, for more than three or four days, the stage is set for the development of hepatic lipidosis. The cat's liver turns to the rapid breakdown of stored fats to serve as a source of energy, but if the liver is unable to process fats as quickly as they are broken down, the liver cells become engorged with fat. This causes the cells to swell and impairs liver function. If fatty liver disease is left untreated, it can progress to complete liver failure, which is often fatal.</p><h2>Symptoms of Fatty Liver Disease in Cats</h2><p>Most often, fatty liver disease is preceded or accompanied by a cat suddenly developing an aversion to its food and refusing to eat. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including underlying illness or extreme stress. The refusal to eat causes the cat to rapidly lose weight-it is not unheard of for the feline to lose as much as 25 percent of its weight-which is often the first symptom of the disorder. Other symptoms develop as the liver struggles to process fat.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>You'll likely first notice that your cat isn't eating as much as normal or is even refusing to eat anything at all. The cat might also refuse to drink. This anorexia quickly leads to weight loss, which can be extensive, especially if your cat was overweight to begin with.</p><p>As the liver begins to fail, jaundice often appears. This is a yellowish tint to the cat's eyes and skin caused by a buildup of bilirubin in the blood due to liver impairment. The cat might have diarrhea or vomiting, and will generally appear lethargic and weak. Your cat might become shyer than usual or hide.</p><h2>Causes of Fatty Liver Disease</h2><p>Any scenario that causes a cat to suddenly stop eating can cause fatty liver disease. While occasionally the reason might be intense environmental stress, such as a recent move, new member of the household, or a change in schedule, most often it's an underlying illness that causes the cat to lose interest in its food.</p><p>Some of the more common underlying illnesses that can lead to hepatic lipidosis include cancer, other diseases of the liver, diabetes, pancreatitis, hyperthyroidism, and kidney disease.</p><p>As a carnivore, a healthy cat's diet should contain a minimum of 50 percent protein, at least 30 percent fat, and less than 10 percent carbohydrates. A healthy feline liver has no problem in processing that fat as the cat consumes it, breaking the fat down and converting it into energy that's sent throughout the body.</p><p>When a cat suddenly stops eating, however, the liver tries to make up for the shortfall of calories by pulling fat out of storage and breaking it down into a usable source of energy. Unfortunately, if the cat has an underlying health problem, the liver can be too sluggish to break down the fat quickly enough, and so the fat begins to clog up the organ's cells. This reduces the liver's ability to function even further, and can eventually cause it to fail altogether.</p><h2>Diagnosing Fatty Liver Disease in Cats</h2><p>If you suspect your cat has fatty liver disease or it has stopped eating for more than a day or two, it should be seen by a veterinarian as soon as possible. A veterinarian will perform a full physical examination, take a full history, and obtain a blood sample to perform a complete blood count and check organ function, as well as look for signs of underlying illnesses.</p><p>Specific enzymes in the blood can provide information that helps the veterinarian determine whether or not the liver is functioning well. These enzymes may provide an indication that your cat has fatty liver disease or another problem causing the same symptoms. Your vet might also want to do an ultrasound of the liver, which can reveal swelling due to hepatic lipidosis.</p><p>In order to definitively diagnose a cat with fatty liver disease, however, a biopsy of the liver is required. This is usually performed by inserting a long needle through the cat's skin and into the liver to retrieve a small sample. If the cat has hepatic lipidosis, microscopic examination of the liver sample will reveal excessive fat in and around the cells.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Because many cats with fatty liver disease are dehydrated when first brought to the animal hospital, they are often started right away on IV fluids. Once the cat is rehydrated, the process of restoring food intake begins. But because these cats are typically unwilling to eat enough to sustain themselves, the standard treatment consists of surgically implanting a feeding tube either into the cat's esophagus or directly into its stomach.</p><p>A special liquid diet that is formulated for cats recovering from fatty liver disease is introduced slowly through the feeding tube, allowing the cat's liver to gradually recover from its strain while still supplying the needed calories and nutrients. Typically, your cat will remain in the veterinary hospital for a week or so. During this time, it will be fed through the tube and may also receive medications to help heal the liver, extra fluids through an IV, and any treatments required to stabilize underlying health issues.</p><p>Once your veterinarian feels that your cat is stable enough to leave the hospital, you will be instructed on how to continue the tube feedings at home. Generally, this involves using a syringe to inject a special prescription food mixed with water into the feeding tube three to five times per day, and then flushing the feeding tube with sterile water to keep it free from clots.</p><p>Most cats require at least six to seven weeks of tube feeding. During this time, your vet may advise you to also offer your cat its favorite food by mouth once a week or so. This will allow you to determine when the cat's normal appetite returns. As your cat begins to eat normally, you will reduce the amount of the tube feedings, as per your veterinarian's instructions.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Fatty Liver Disease</h2><p>If your cat receives prompt treatment before the hepatic lipidosis progresses to full liver failure, its prognosis is good. Most cats recover from the condition and do not experience another episode. However, if your cat has a serious underlying condition that triggered the fatty liver disease, and that condition is not treatable, then your cat's prognosis is more guarded</p>",1271
64,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-treat-stomatitis-in-cats-4768670,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Stomatitis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Stomatitis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2> <p>If you notice your cat exhibiting unusual behavior or discomfort, especially in and around the mouth, consider feline stomatitis, an aggressive inflammatory disease, as a possible cause. The cause of stomatitis in cats is unclear, but contributing factors include dental disease and immune disease. Symptoms of stomatitis in cats may include decreased appetite, excessive drooling, redness in the gums, and an unkempt coat. While stomatitis in cats is an incredibly painful condition, most cats respond well to medical management, regular oral care, and surgical intervention. If stomatitis is left untreated, it can be life-threatening. If you think your cat may have stomatitis, visit your vet.</p><h2>What Is Stomatitis?</h2><p>Feline stomatitis is a severe, painful inflammation of a cat 's mouth and gums. Stomatitis should not be confused with gingivitis, a common, less painful inflammation of the gums. Stomatitis refers to more generalized inflammation of the mucous membranes within the mouth. In most cases, the condition causes painful ulcers and lesions to form in the mouth. These ulcers can develop on the lips, tongue, gums, and back of the throat.</p><h2>Symptoms of Stomatitis in Cats</h2><p>One of the most common stomatitis symptoms is severe pain. This can manifest in a variety of ways. In some cases, a cat suffering from stomatitis may be in too much pain to open its mouth to eat. If your cat can open its mouth, dry food is likely too painful to chew, so wet food is a better option. In some cases, due to the chronic pain, your cat may exhibit behavioral changes such as acting withdrawn or irritable. This can be confused with your cat being a picky eater when in fact, it has mouth pain.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Excessive Drooling</h3><p>While drooling in dogs is common and perfectly healthy, it is not normal in cats. If you notice your cat drooling, you should take it to the vet for further examination.</p><h3>Bad Breath</h3><p>If your cat has unusually bad breath, it could be a symptom of stomatitis. The bad breath can be attributed to mucus membrane inflammation and a build-up of plaque and tartar. It's also possible that the build-up could have preceded the stomatitis, contributing to the development of the disease. In either case, pay attention to the smell of your cat's breath.</p><h3>Weight Loss</h3><p>Weight loss in cats is a possible symptom of stomatitis, as severe mouth pain will deter your cat from eating its food. Even if your cat can physically eat, stomatitis can cause loss of appetite.</p><h3>Pawing at Face or Mouth</h3><p>If you notice your cat pawing at its face, it may be a symptom of oral discomfort caused by stomatitis. Pay attention to accompanying symptoms that may connect the pawing to stomatitis.</p><h3>Decreased Appetite</h3><p>Decreased appetite is a common symptom of stomatitis. In addition to oral pain making chewing too difficult to eat, the pain itself can cause a decrease in appetite.</p><h3>Unkempt Coat</h3><p>Your cat may not be keeping up with typical grooming habits. Licking its coat may be too painful. If your cat's coat looks unkempt, or you notice your cat grooming less often or not at all, consider stomatitis and related oral pain as a cause.</p><h3>Red and Inflamed Gums</h3><p>Stomatitis in cats can cause severely inflamed, reddened gums as the oral mucus membranes become damaged. Gingivitis can also cause redness and inflammation, so consider taking your cat to the vet to get the correct diagnosis.</p><h3>Pain When Its Face Is Touched</h3><p>If your cat has stomatitis, its face will likely be sensitive to the touch. Oral pain from the disease can permeate throughout the face, affecting your cat's response to facial touch.</p><h3>Lethargy Due to Pain</h3><p>Chronic pain due to stomatitis can exhaust your cat. Additionally, lack of nutrition following a loss of appetite will lower your cat's energy and lead to lethargy.</p><h3>Difficulty Swallowing</h3><p>Difficulty swallowing may be a symptom of stomatitis in your cat. This could be a result of excessive salvation, another stomatitis symptom. Mouth inflammation also contributes to difficulty swallowing.</p><h2>Causes of Stomatitis</h2><p>Unfortunately, the causes of stomatitis in cats are not yet completely understood. In many cases, the cause is assumed to be immune-mediated, meaning that the cat 's immune system attacks its oral tissues as an abnormal response to bacteria in the mouth.</p><h2>Diagnosing Stomatitis in Cats</h2><p>If your cat is exhibiting any of the above symptoms, schedule an exam with your veterinarian. Your vet will begin with an exam of your cat and basic bloodwork, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and chemistry panel, to look for any underlying systematic disease. Your vet may also recommend specific testing for underlying conditions such as FeLV and FIV.</p><p>Examining the mouth of a cat with stomatitis can be difficult because the cat is reluctant to open its mouth due to pain. Your veterinarian may recommend sedation to facilitate a more complete and comfortable examination.</p><p>The diagnosis is commonly based on a combination of clinical signs and physical examination findings. A dental examination and dental X-rays can help your veterinarian determine the extent of periodontal disease. Sometimes, a veterinarian may recommend submitting a small tissue sample from the mouth for biopsy.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Management and treatment of stomatitis can be challenging due to the cause of the disease not being fully understood. Stomatitis treatment will vary depending on the stage and severity of the condition and a cat's response to therapies.</p><p>Regular dental care and medical management are typically the first lines of treatment. Your vet should perform a routine dental cleaning and dental x-rays under anesthesia to address any inflammatory dental disease, remove plaque and tartar, and clean the tissues beneath the gum line.</p><p>Ideally, you should brush your cat's teeth regularly after the dental cleaning. However, cats with stomatitis often have too much oral pain to tolerate brushing. Oral rinses or gels may be of benefit.</p><p>The goal of treatment is to manage pain and decrease inflammation. Some cats will respond to routine dental cleanings under anesthesia and at-home care like chlorhexidine rinses or gels.</p><p>If medical management is not helping, your veterinarian may recommend extractions of affected teeth or all teeth under anesthesia. It might sound drastic, but cats do very well without teeth. Tooth surfaces provide areas for bacteria to attach. Removing the teeth can help control periodontal disease and minimize the bacteria that provoke the immune system in cats with stomatitis. Cats continue to eat and live happy lives without teeth.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Stomatitis</h2><p>Stomatitis is a challenging (and often expensive) disease to handle. Stomatitis in cats can be difficult to treat and can potentially be life-threatening, but many cats are responsive to treatment. This may include non-surgical therapies, but cats will usually require a combination of surgery and medication. There is no cure for stomatitis in cats, but you can successfully manage it with care and attention. Although it is considered a therapy and not a cure, no additional medical treatment will be necessary if you elect your cat to have a full mouth extraction. If your cat responds well to treatment, you can look forward to an overall improvement in the quality of its life.</p>",1159
65,https://www.thesprucepets.com/effective-treatments-for-arthritis-in-cats-3384622,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Arthritis In Cats</h1>,"<h1>Arthritis In Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Just as in humans, cats often develop arthritis as they age. Arthritis occurs when the cartilage between bones deteriorates. This makes joints less flexible causing stiffness and pain with movement, and sometimes even while at rest if the deterioration is accompanied by severe inflammation.</p><p>Until recently, cats were thought to be unlikely to develop arthritis. We now know, however, that they are affected by this disease, just like dogs and other animals. But while dogs with arthritis show lameness and pain, cats are lighter, more agile, and smaller than dogs, allowing them to compensate for compromised joints. Cats also tend to conceal signs of pain and only show subtle indications of discomfort until the pain becomes too great to hide. Still, there is no reason for your aging pet to suffer, and there are quite a few treatments to ease the discomfort of your cat's arthritis.</p><h2>What Is Arthritis?</h2><p>Arthritis, also called osteoarthritis or degenerative joint disease (DJD), is a painful and progressive bone disease. In osteoarthritis, the cartilage that normally provides protection between bones wears away, causing inflammation and painful bone-on-bone grinding. Cats develop arthritis of the shoulders, wrists, knees, elbows, and hips most frequently, but any joint can be affected. Although a very common condition amongst senior cats and other mammals, arthritis is not merely a ""normal part of aging."" With proper care and treatment, your cat can comfortably enjoy its golden years, although there is no way to reverse the degeneration in the joints.</p><h2>Symptoms of Arthritis in Cats</h2><p>Cats tend to hide signs of pain quite effectively, which makes sense if you consider their ancestry as solitary hunters. A sick animal in the wild is vulnerable to predators, so any sign of weakness must be hidden. This instinct makes it difficult for owners to know their cats are affected and whether treatment is necessary.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The most obvious sign of arthritis in an aging cat is the loss of interest in jumping up to high places to explore, or often, even to jump up onto furniture or a bed that was once a favorite sleeping spot. You might notice that your cat walks with a stiff or uneven gait, walks slowly, and stops frequently to rest. Many cats will sleep more than usual, or simply remain still to avoid painful movements.</p><p>Arthritic pain tends to also cause behavioral changes, including irritability. Your cat might no longer enjoy being petted, and will likely lose interest in playing. Pain often prevents an arthritic cat from using its scratching post, which can lead to overgrown nails. Often, an arthritic cat will stop grooming itself, as it is too painful to bend and twist. You'll notice that your cat's coat is not as clean and neat as it once was. Some cats will even stop using the litter box, and instead, relieve themselves in inappropriate places around the house.</p><h2>Causes of Arthritis in Cats</h2><p>The most common cause of arthritis in cats, particularly senior cats, is the wear-and-tear on joints called osteoarthritis. In fact, as much as 90 percent of cats over the age of 12 show signs of osteoarthritis in x-rays. Obesity is also strongly associated with the development of arthritis. However, there are other less-common types of arthritis in cats. Hip dysplasia is a genetic condition that causes the hip joint to develop abnormally. The malformed hip joint deteriorates faster than other joints in the body and is more vulnerable to the development of arthritis. Trauma, autoimmune disease, diabetes, and hormonal disorders can also make a cat likelier to suffer from arthritis.</p><h2>Diagnosing Arthritis in Cats</h2><p>Your veterinarian will perform a full physical examination on your cat and probably order blood or urine tests as well. Occasionally, x-rays might be ordered to look for signs of wear-and-tear or other damage to your cat's joints. But for the most part, a diagnosis of arthritis in a senior cat is made based on characteristic symptoms that can't be attributed to another cause.</p><h2>Treatment of Arthritis in Cats</h2><h3>Medications</h3><p>It's best to work with your veterinarian to discuss pain relief treatments for your cat. Your vet will assess your cat and may prescribe medication to relieve pain.</p><p>Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are sometimes prescribed for feline arthritis, which is similar to how the condition is treated in humans. NSAIDs are highly effective at controlling pain and inflammation of joints. Side effects of NSAIDs include vomiting, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. If you notice any of these side effects, call your veterinarian right away.</p><p>Note: Pet owners must be cautious when administering medications and only use those prescribed by a veterinarian. Never give a cat medication intended for a human. A standard dose of an NSAID for a human could cause major kidney damage or death in a cat. Acetaminophen (sold under the brand name Tylenol) is another common drug given to humans to treat arthritis that should never be given to a cat under any circumstances; there's no safe dosage of this medication for cats.</p><p>Other options for an arthritic cat include dietary supplements, such as glucosamine, chondroitin, and omega-3 fatty acids. These supplements help support the joints and should be used with a veterinarian's approval.</p><h3>Weight Control</h3><p>Because excess weight puts more stress on aching joints, it's important for your arthritic cat to maintain a healthy weight. If your cat needs to lose weight, you should cut back on treats, consider offering meals just twice a day rather than leaving food available at all times and talk to your vet about prescription cat food, which is specially formulated to cut calories while still offering peak nutrition.</p><p>And although older cats, particularly those with arthritis, aren't always as playful as they were in their younger days, it's still important to encourage your cat to stay as active as possible by providing toys for solitary play as well as interactive playtime with you. Exercise helps to lubricate the arthritic joints and also helps with weight loss.</p><h3>Alternative Treatments</h3><p>These alternative methods carry a minimal risk for your cat, though they can be costly. The combination of medication and non-medical therapies can provide more effective pain relief for an arthritic cat.</p><p>For older cats, a heated bed or blanket or even a hot water bottle may provide relief from the pain and stiffness of arthritis. It may take some coaxing, but once your cat is acclimated to the heated bed, it should be a source of comfort.</p><p>Other ways to help reduce your cat's discomfort include raised food and water bowls, a ramp to help reach favorite sleeping spots, such as the couch or your bed, and rugs or other nonslip coverings on hard floors to make walking easier for your aging pet. A litter box with low sides makes it easier for an arthritic cat to climb in and out and may help ward off inappropriate elimination around the house.</p><h2>Preventing Arthritis in Cats</h2><p>Maintaining your cat at a healthy weight is essential. If an arthritic cat becomes overweight, this places additional strain on already painful joints. If your arthritic cat is already overweight, talk with your veterinarian about how to safely encourage weight loss. Regulating your cat's diet and encouraging exercise are the best ways to maintain your cat's body weight. Your veterinarian may recommend a specific diet that promotes weight loss. Ration your pet's food and treats, and experiment with different types of toys to figure out which ones your cat prefers and which keep your cat the most active.</p>",1228

It can develop suddenly with severe symptoms in some cats, while others may have more mild symptoms. It 's often caused by a bacterial infection of the gallbladder and bile duct.</p><p>Cats with gallbladder infections will show symptoms like loss of appetite, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. They may also exhibit a yellow tint to their skin and gums. Gallbladder infections aren 't contagious, but they usually occur when bacteria in the blood or the gastrointestinal tract moves into the gallbladder. Gallbladder infections are serious and require medical treatment. Sometimes, surgery is needed to resolve the condition.</p><h2>What Is Gallbladder Infection in Cats?</h2><p>Gallbladder inflammation (also called cholecystitis) has many causes, with bacterial infection being one of the most common. Bacteria move from the bloodstream or intestines into the gallbladder, causing potentially life-threatening infections in cats.</p><p>This condition is not contagious. Rather, it's suspected to occur in cats when the gallbladder becomes inflamed and bacteria have an opportunity to invade and cause infection, or when there 's a primary bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract that enters the gallbladder. In some cases, the definitive cause of gallbladder inflammation is not known. Bacteria that have been identified from gallbladder infections in cats include , , , and.</p><p>Just like in humans, a cat 's gallbladder is located under the liver. The gallbladder stores bile made in the liver, and then releases it through a small duct into the upper intestines. Bile helps with the break down of fats in the intestine and includes wastes that are then excreted. Infections in the gallbladder disrupt these normal processes.</p><p>Gallbladder inflammation and/or infection may be related to disease in nearby organs like the liver, intestines, or pancreas, as well as to systemic diseases like cancer, immune-mediated disease, and/or abdominal trauma. More rarely, gallbladder infection may be caused by obstruction of the bile duct due to gallbladder stones or a tumor. If the bile duct becomes obstructed and bile cannot pass out of the gallbladder, this can lead to further inflammation and tissue destruction as the gallbladder fills up with bile. This creates an environment within the gallbladder that promotes bacterial colonization and growth.</p><h2>Symptoms of a Gallbladder Infection in Cats</h2><p>Cats with gallbladder infections may become suddenly ill, or they may exhibit milder signs that develop over time or come and go. If the infection is mild, they may not show any symptoms.</p><p>Symptoms are often gastrointestinal in nature, and cats may stop eating or have a decreased appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. They may also develop a yellow tint to their skin, called jaundice, which can best be seen on the inside of the ear, whites of the eyes, and on the gums.</p><h3>Lack of appetite</h3><p>Cats may stop eating or eat less of their food. If your cat is sick, you may observe food remaining in bowls when normally the bowls would be emptied, lack of interest in treats, or your cat may sniff the food and walk away.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p>Symptoms of fever include decreased activity, hiding, not eating, and/or not wanting to move or interact with family members. A temperature above 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit would indicate a fever.</p><h3>Jaundice</h3><p>Jaundice occurs when a bile pigment called bilirubin is not properly excreted by the body and builds up in the body tissues, creating a yellow tint. Bilirubin is a component of red blood cells, and when old and damaged red blood cells are destroyed by the liver, the bilirubin is normally excreted into the bile and then exits the body as waste in the feces and/or urine. If there is problem with any part of that pathway, the bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to jaundice.</p><h3>Abdominal pain</h3><p>Gallbladder infection can cause pain in the abdomen. A cat experiencing pain may sit in an abnormal hunched position, hide, resist being handled or petted, or cry out or become defensive when touched. Cats may also appear more restless than normal due to the inability to rest in a comfortable position, and some cats will also lick their bellies excessively when they are in pain.</p><h3>Vomiting and diarrhea</h3><p>Cats may show symptoms of gastrointestinal upset, like vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and weight loss. Cats who are nauseous may also lick their lips frequently and/or drool.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>Cats who are lethargic may sleep much more than usual and show a lack of interest in everyday activities. Cats may also stop grooming themselves and their fur may appear messy and unclean. Pain, fever, nausea, dehydration and weakness can contribute to lethargy.</p><h3>Weight loss</h3><p>Weight loss occurs because cats stop eating and don 't take in enough calories and nutrients. Cats may also lose nutrients and electrolytes through vomiting and diarrhea.</p><h3>Shock</h3><p>In cases where there is very severe inflammation and/or infection of the gallbladder, cats may go into shock. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate emergency treatment. Symptoms of shock include rapid, shallow breathing, rapid heart rate, pale gums, collapse, reluctance to move or stand, and low body temperature.</p><h2>Causes of Gallbladder Infection</h2><p>While it 's not fully understood why some cats develop gallbladder infections, there are several conditions that can predispose a cat to inflammation and bacterial infection.</p><h2>Diagnosing Gallbladder Infection in Cats</h2><p>To diagnose a gallbladder infection, your veterinarian will conduct a physical examination and perform several tests. This includes bloodwork, abdominal radiographs, an ultrasound of the abdomen and in some cases, biopsies and/or bacterial cultures of the gallbladder. Because the signs of a gallbladder infection can overlap with other diseases and conditions, it 's necessary to perform these tests to determine the cause of your cat 's symptoms.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Gallbladder infections can be managed medically, but surgery to remove the gallbladder may be necessary depending on the severity of the condition. Treatment includes correcting dehydration and electrolyte imbalances by providing intravenous fluids if necessary, and prescribing appropriate antibiotics to eradicate the infection. Your cat may need to be on antibiotics for a month or more to ensure the infection is gone. Cats may also need to be given drugs to prevent nausea, stimulate appetite, and support the liver.</p><p>If surgery is indicated, your cat will be hospitalized for a period of time before and after the procedure to be monitored. Your veterinarian may recommend repeating bloodwork and other tests to ensure your cat is recovering properly.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Gallbladder Infection</h2><p>Prognosis depends on the severity of the infection and whether there are additional abnormalities that led to the infection. There is generally a good outlook for cats with mild disease and cats that respond well to antibiotics. The presence of severe inflammation can be a risk factor for poor outcomes.</p><p>Some cases can be fatal, and complications, like bile duct obstruction and rupture, can increase the risk of severe complications and death. If gallbladder infection is suspected, early treatment is crucial. Once a cat has had a gallbladder infection, recurrence is a possibility, so it 's important that you carefully monitor your cat for symptoms and seek veterinary care if they occur.</p><h2>How to Prevent Gallbladder Infection</h2><p>Since the cause of gallbladder infection is not always entirely clear, it 's difficult to know how to prevent it. Seeking immediate veterinary care if your cat exhibits any symptoms, like not eating, vomiting, and/or lethargy, will help with controlling the condition early and improving outcomes.</p>",1213
67,https://www.thesprucepets.com/inflammatory-bowel-disease-in-cats-5093302,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease is a syndrome of chronic inflammation and irritation in a cat's gastrointestinal tract, which includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and colon (large intestine). The most common symptom is chronic vomiting, but in some cats, chronic diarrhea, or both vomiting and diarrhea, occur. It can also cause weight loss, lack of appetite, and lethargy.</p><p>Middle-aged to senior cats are likeliest to develop inflammatory bowel disease, although it can occasionally strike younger cats. The syndrome is not always easy to diagnose, and it has complex causes that are not fully understood, but with treatment, which generally includes both medications and diet modifications, your cat can have a good quality of life.</p><h2>What Is Inflammatory Bowel Disease?</h2><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a gastrointestinal syndrome where the GI tract is chronically inflamed and irritated. It occurs in many animals, including dogs and humans. The cause of this disorder is not well understood, but it is likely due to abnormal interactions between the immune system, dietary factors, bacteria in the intestines, and possibly genetics.</p><p>The chronic inflammation of the GI tract leads to thickening of the walls of the cat's digestive system organs, which makes it more difficult for them to perform their functions of digesting food and absorbing nutrients.</p><p>IBD is a complex condition, and takes many forms. If it predominantly affects the cat's stomach, it is called gastritis. If the inflammation is mostly in the large intestines, the condition is labeled colitis. However, most often it is the small intestines that have the worst inflammation, and this type of IBD is called enteritis. Note that a cat may have inflammation in all areas of the GI tract, however.</p><p>Occasionally, the cat's liver and/or pancreas are also inflamed.</p><h2>Symptoms of IBD in Cats</h2><p>As IBD is a gastrointestinal disease, the most common symptoms are general GI signs. This can be vomiting, diarrhea (with or without blood), a lack of appetite, weight loss, and/or lethargy. If the cat mostly experiences vomiting, many owners dismiss the symptom as nothing more than hairballs or mild stomach upset. However, it is not normal for a cat to experience frequent vomiting. In fact, if your cat vomits more than once a month, that's an indication that there may be an underlying health problem of some type that requires a visit to the veterinarian.</p><p>If your cat has IBD, they may have any combination of these symptoms, or they may only have one symptom, typically chronic vomiting. The symptoms your cat shows will also depend on what part of your cat's GI tract is inflamed. If it's the stomach with the worst inflammation, vomiting is the chief symptom. Severe inflammation of the intestines leads to chronic diarrhea. If the cat has inflammation throughout the entire GI tract, it may experience both chronic diarrhea and vomiting. Symptoms can come and go and vary in severity.</p><h2>Causes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h2><p>The symptoms of IBD are caused by chronic inflammation within the cat's GI tract, but that inflammation is triggered by one or more underlying issues. Because IBD in dogs and humans has a known relationship to genetic abnormalities in the immune system, it is assumed that the same is true of IBD in cats. Other suspected triggers include bacterial infections of the GI tract, infestation with intestinal parasites, and food allergies to various proteins. Often, the underlying cause cannot be determined, however.</p><h2>Diagnosing IBD in Cats</h2><p>Since the symptoms (or symptom) of IBD are also symptoms of other gastrointestinal illnesses, your vet may want to run a variety of tests to rule out other issues.</p><p>Along with a full physical exam, your veterinarian will likely order a variety of blood tests to assess your cat's overall health, including kidney, liver, and thyroid function. A complete blood count can indicate anemia, infection, or allergies, depending on the number and type of white blood cells. Occasionally, your vet might want to test the cat's blood levels of vitamin B12, as decreased levels indicate gastrointestinal difficulty with absorbing nutrients. Often, blood folate levels are checked at the same time, as high levels can indicate an overgrowth of bacteria in the intestines, while low levels indicate intestinal disease.</p><p>When you call to make your appointment you will probably be asked to bring in a fresh stool sample so your vet can check for intestinal parasites. Try to collect your cat's stool the day of the appointment for the most accurate results.</p><p>An abdominal ultrasound is a common component of a workup for a cat suspected of having IBD, as it can show the characteristic thickening of the intestinal walls and stomach and may also rule out cancer or pancreatitis.</p><p>For a definitive diagnosis of IBD, your vet will need to take biopsies of your cat's GI tract. These samples are then sent off to a veterinary pathologist, who will look at the samples microscopically to detect inflammatory changes that are typical with inflammatory bowel disease.</p><h2>Treatment & Prevention</h2><p>Since IBD can sometimes be caused by food allergies, your vet may recommend a special diet for your cat. This could be a commercially prepared, 'limited ingredient' diet or it could be a prescription, hydrolyzed diet.</p><p>If choosing a commercial diet, it is important to pick one that uses a novel protein. This means selecting a protein source that your cat has never eaten before. Most commercial limited ingredient cat diets utilize rabbit, duck, or venison as their protein.</p><p>Prescription diets contain proteins that are hydrolyzed, meaning they are broken down into their individual amino acid components so that your cat's immune system will not recognize them as a potential allergen.</p><p>Whether you start your cat on a commercial diet or a prescription type, it is vitally important that you feed the new diet for a period of 8 to 12 weeks. This means no other food, treats, etc. as these may cause a potential adverse reaction, making you believe the new diet isn't working.</p><p>Your vet may also start your cat on the antibiotic metronidazole to help treat any bacteria that may be causing the IBD symptoms. Corticosteroids such as prednisolone will work to suppress your cat's immune system so that it doesn't overreact to an allergen or something potentially inflammatory. However, long term steroid use in cats comes with its own set of concerns, so your vet will instruct you on how to taper the dosage so that you are giving as minimal amount as possible while still providing relief.</p><p>Because the causes of IBD are often unknown, and so are difficult to predict or control, there is little you can do to prevent your cat from developing inflammatory bowel disease other than feeding it a high quality diet, visiting your vet regularly for checkups, and taking lengthy or frequent bouts of diarrhea or vomiting seriously.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with IBD</h2><p>IBD can be treated, but not cured. Still, with proper treatment, most cats improve and lead happy and normal lives, although occasional flareups of the condition are common. If your cat does well on its special diet, that diet should be continued for the remainder of the cat's life. It's also a good sign when the cat responds well to medical management of the IBD.</p><p>If your cat does not respond to dietary changes or medications, however, the prognosis is not as good. In these cats, further testing may be recommended, as intestinal lymphoma, which is a type of cancer, may have developed.</p>",1226
68,https://www.thesprucepets.com/treating-feline-calicivirus-5075717,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Feline Calicivirus (FCV) In Cats</h1>,"<h1>Feline Calicivirus (FCV) In Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Upper respiratory issues occur fairly commonly in cats and are often caused by infectious diseases. Feline calicivirus (FCV) is is a common virus that usually causes upper respiratory infections in cats, causing sneezing, runny nose and eyes, and sometimes painful sores inside the mouth or even sudden lameness. This highly contagious disease can easily spread throughout a population of cats, making it a major problem in animal-shelter environments. Fortunately, although there is no direct cure for the illness, most cats recover completely with supportive care, although many will become asymptomatic carriers of the virus.</p><h2>What Is Feline Calicivirus?</h2><p>Feline calicivirus is a highly contagious viral pathogen that affects cats. It is part of a family of RNA viruses called . Some other types of calicivirus can affect humans and other animals, but feline calicivirus strains will only affect cats.</p><p>FCV most commonly affects a cat's upper respiratory system and oral cavity. However, the virus can affect other systems in the body on occasion.</p><p>Typically, a cat that is exposed to the calicivirus will go through a two- to six-day incubation period before symptoms appear. Once the illness starts, it generally lasts for two to three weeks. The cat is contagious during this entire period. As many as 50 percent of infected cats will continue to carry the virus even after recovery, and this carrier stage can last from months to the rest of the cat's life. Although feline carriers of FCV often show no symptoms themselves, they are still contagious to other cats. Female cats carrying FCV can pass the disease to their kittens, as well.</p><h2>Symptoms of Feline Calicivirus</h2><p>A cat suffering from FCV generally has symptoms similar to those experienced by humans with a common cold. Stuffy nose, running nose and eyes, sneezing, loss of appetite, and a general malaise are most common, but with more severe infection, the cat can develop equally severe symptoms. Kittens and senior cats are more likely to experience severe illness than young adult or middle-aged cats.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Cats with calicivirus most commonly develop signs of upper respiratory infection, including discharge from the eyes and/or nose, and sneezing. Severe upper respiratory infections can progress to pneumonia.</p><p>Feline calicivirus may also cause cats to develop painful ulcers in the mouth, especially on the tongue. The pain may cause the cat to refuse to eat, and generally will cause the cat to drool, sometimes heavily. FCV is also associated with stomatitis, which is characterized by significant inflammation of the mouth and lips.</p><p>Lameness and fever occur in some cases of feline calicivirus. In addition, some cats may contract a more serious strain-called FCV-VSD-that causes a virulent systemic infection. This may affect the major organs and can lead to more serious issues like skin lesions and ulcers, loss of appetite, fever, and jaundice.</p><p>Feline calicivirus-related infections may be chronic in some cats. They may periodically experience flare-ups of symptoms.</p><p>It is possible for some cats to be carriers of feline calicivirus. These cats may show no signs of disease but can still transmit the virus to other cats.</p><h2>Causes of Calicivirus in Cats</h2><p>There are several strains of feline calicivirus, all of which are highly contagious. A cat contracts FCV via direct contact with an infected cat's saliva, eye/nasal discharge, or aerosolized droplets from sneezes. The virus enters a cat's body through the nose, mouth, or eyes. Infected female cats can also pass the virus on to their kittens.</p><p>Feline calicivirus is most commonly spread in multi-cat environments. Animal shelters, pet stores, catteries, and boarding facilities are considered high-risk spaces, and as many as 40 percent of the cats housed in these high-density places may be carriers-and thus spreaders-of FCV.</p><p>Cats that have received all boosters of the FVRCP vaccine may have some immunity as the ""C"" in this vaccine stands for calicivirus. However, because there are multiple different strains of feline calicivirus, not all are covered in the vaccine. Vaccinated cats can still contract feline calicivirus, but they may experience milder symptoms.</p><h2>Diagnosing Feline Calicivirus</h2><p>Generally, your veterinarian will diagnose your cat with FCV based on clinical symptoms, particularly if your cat has ulcers inside its mouth. Occasionally, however, a vet may decide to take a swab of secretions from the ill cat's mouth, nose, or eyes, and have it tested for the presence of the virus. If your cat develops lameness, the vet may order an x-ray as well to rule out other potential causes of the limp.</p><h2>Feline Calicivirus Treatment</h2><p>There is no cure for feline calicivirus, nor is there a specific treatment for this common disease. However, supportive treatment can help keep your cat more comfortable while it recovers, as well as prevent secondary bacterial infections, such as pneumonia.</p><p>Cats with mild to moderate upper respiratory infections will usually be sent home under your care. Your vet may prescribe nasal decongestants, eye drops to relieve ocular inflammation, and systemic anti-inflammatory drugs. Antibiotics may be prescribed to treat secondary infections. Nasal drops or nebulization may be necessary for cats with severe nasal congestion.</p><p>Cats with FCV often lose their appetite because they cannot taste or smell as well as usual. Plus, oral ulcers can make eating very uncomfortable for some cats. An appetite stimulant may be recommended if your cat is not eating well. It's important to feed strong-smelling foods that appeal to your cat, and soft food is best if oral ulcers have developed.</p><p>Cats with moderate to severe signs may require hospitalization for supportive care. These cats typically receive intravenous fluids to support hydration and injectable medications to manage symptoms. Breathing treatments may be necessary if the cat develops pneumonia. A feeding tube may need to be placed if your cat is not eating.</p><h2>Prognosis</h2><p>Most cats will recover fully from FCV, although there is a good chance that they will become carriers of the virus for at least a short while. However, cats with the most severe form of the disease, FCV-VSD, have a poorer prognosis, with up to 60 percent succumbing to the disease.</p><h2>Prevention of Feline Calicivirus in Cats</h2><p>The best way to protect your cat from feline calicivirus is to vaccinate regularly. While the calicivirus vaccine will not fully prevent contraction of the virus, it will help your cat fight off the infection and experience milder symptoms. Your veterinarian might also recommend a booster if your cat will be spending time in a kennel, groomer, or other location with a high density of cats.</p><p>Cats with feline calicivirus should be kept separate from other cats to prevent the spread of the disease. Multi-cat environments should be cleaned thoroughly and routinely with pet-safe disinfectants to minimize accidental exposure.</p><p>And of course, it's always important to keep your cat in optimal health by feeding it a high-quality, balanced diet formulated specifically for cats, encouraging it to exercise regularly through play sessions, and scheduling regular veterinary checkups to ward off health problems before they turn serious</p>",1134
69,https://www.thesprucepets.com/bronchitis-in-cats-5074558,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Bronchitis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Bronchitis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Feline bronchitis, sometimes called feline allergic bronchitis or feline asthma, is caused by inflammation in the cat's lower airways. The primary symptom is a cough, which might come and go or might be frequent. Although any cat can develop bronchitis, it is most common in cats that are 2 to 8 years old, particularly in Siamese cats or cats that are overweight.</p><p>Although feline bronchitis is usually a chronic condition, there are medications and steps you can take to help your pet live a nearly normal life.</p><h2>What Is Bronchitis?</h2><p>Bronchitis is an inflammation of the lower airways, particularly the bronchi, which are the two main tubes that branch off the trachea (windpipe) into the lungs. Bronchitis is not exclusive to cats, as it is a fairly common condition that affects many other animals, including humans and dogs.</p><p>The inflammation can cause excessive secretions within the bronchi, as well as swelling, making it difficult for your cat to easily breathe in and out. The persistent cough is the cat's body's way of trying to clear the excess secretions from the airways.</p><p>Bronchitis is sometimes an acute process that comes on suddenly and can be reversed with prompt treatment, but most often in cats, it leads to permanent changes in the airways and becomes a chronic condition that can be managed but not cured.</p><h2>Symptoms of Bronchitis in Cats</h2><p>The most common symptom of bronchitis in cats is a dry, hacking cough. Coughing cats will typically squat down low and extend their neck while opening their mouths. If you think this sounds a lot like the position a cat assumes when it is coughing up a hairball, you'd be correct. In fact, the first few times you catch your cat coughing, you may think it is coughing up a hairball. The difference being a true cough won't end in a hairball on your floor.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Other commonly seen symptoms in cats having a flareup of chronic bronchitis include whistling or wheezing with each breath (usually heard more audibly on exhale than inhale) and difficulty breathing, which might display as the cat's sides heaving in and out. A cat that is really struggling to breathe will often pant with an open mouth. Panting is not a normal behavior in cats like it is in dogs, and if you see your cat suddenly panting, you should seek veterinary medical attention immediately.</p><p>As your cat's bronchitis progresses, you may also start to see a decrease in energy, with the cat sleeping more, playing less, and generally appearing fatigued. It's important to note that cats with bronchitis typically won't lose their appetite or have a fever. Your cat's bronchitis symptoms may be cyclical, seasonal, or even constant, depending on the cause.</p><h2>Causes of Bronchitis</h2><p>Basically, bronchitis is inflammation of the bronchi, often accompanied by excessive secretions and swelling. The underlying mechanism of this inflammation is not well understood, but there are many potential triggers of this condition.</p><p>Often, it is not possible to determine the specific trigger for your cat's bronchitis, however.</p><h2>Diagnosing Bronchitis in Cats</h2><p>When you initially bring your cat in for coughing or difficulty breathing, your veterinarian will begin by listening to your cat's heart and lungs. Abnormalities in your cat's lower airways can be heard with a stethoscope in many cases. From there, your vet will likely take an x-ray of your cat's chest to look for any changes that would suggest bronchitis or any other reason for your cat's symptoms.</p><p>Your cat probably will have several blood tests, including a general chemistry panel to assess the cat's overall health. A complete blood count (CBC) is usually ordered to determine your cat's white blood cell levels; an increased level of a certain type of white blood cell called an eosinophil is often associated with allergies. Your vet might also want to check a stool sample in search of lung worms.</p><p>More specialized tests such as a bronchoscopy or a wash of your cat's airway system may be performed. Both of these tests require your cat to be under general anesthesia. A bronchoscopy involves a tiny fiber optic scope passed through your cat's mouth and down into its airways. This lets your vet better visualize your cat's entire respiratory system. Tracheal lavage is a wash of the airways that gathers cells for examination under the microscope in search of signs of chronic inflammation or other abnormalities.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Since feline bronchitis can be caused by a variety of things, and since determining the true cause can be difficult, treatment takes a multimodal approach. This often includes both medications and environmental changes.</p><p>Medical treatment for bronchitis usually includes a bronchodilator such as albuterol, which helps open up constricted airways. Bronchodilators are usually inhaled medications. Corticosteroids, such as prednisolone, are also commonly prescribed to help reduce airway inflammation. Corticosteroids can be injected, inhaled, or delivered in pill form.</p><p>If your cat requires inhaled medications, your veterinarian will help you learn to use an inhaler specially designed for feline patients.</p><p>If your vet determines that your cat has an underlying bacterial infection causing the bronchitis, antibiotics, whether injected or in oral form, will also be required. Parasitic infections of lungworms or heartworms must be treated, as well.</p><p>Removing common airway allergens from your home is also a recommended long-term treatment for bronchitis. Don't expose your cat to cigarette smoke, strong perfumes, essential oils, or scented cleaning supplies. Wash your cat's bedding with a dye-free, fragrance-free detergent. It's often helpful to switch your cat's litter to a low-dust, fragrance-free brand, as well. Of course, all cats have different litter preferences, so keep an eye on your cat's bathroom habits to ensure it accepts its new litter.</p><p>Installing air purifiers and filters throughout your home can also keep airborne allergens to a minimum. Nutritionally, a cat with bronchitis may benefit from a weight loss plan if it is overweight. It's best to discuss an appropriate strategy with your veterinarian.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Bronchitis</h2><p>With treatment, your cat is likely to live a fairly normal life. However, because feline bronchitis is usually chronic, be prepared to take your cat to the vet for checkups more often than a healthy cat would require, and know that you will probably be giving your cat some type of medication for the rest of its life.</p><h2>How to Prevent Bronchitis</h2><p>It is not always possible to prevent bronchitis in cats, as it can be allergy-related or due to an unknown trigger. However, getting your cat treatment for any signs of respiratory infection-including coughing, sneezing, runny eyes, or runny nose-can sometimes ward off bronchitis before it becomes chronic. And keeping your home free of common airway irritants, such as cigarette smoke, strong fragrances, essential oils, and excessive dust can also help prevent allergic responses that lead to chronic airway inflammation.</p>",1114

Cats love to hunt rodents of all kinds and will often bring home what they catch. Unfortunately, they may also bring home rodent illnesses: infections, parasites, or toxins that they contracted from their prey, some of which can be fatal if left untreated. Recognizing the signs of these varied illnesses, which range from gastrointestinal distress to neurological problems, is critical because prompt veterinary attention may be required to save your cat's life.</p><h2>What Are Rodent Illnesses?</h2><p>Rodent illnesses are those infections, diseases, or toxicities carried and transmitted by rodent species. These include toxoplasmosis, plague bacteria, hantavirus, tularemia, intestinal parasites, and rodenticide toxins.</p><h2>Symptoms of Rodent Illnesses in Cats</h2><p>Symptoms of rat-borne illnesses in cats are sometimes severe and may affect multiple bodily systems from head to tail. Many of the following symptoms may occur with more than one illness, so knowing specific characteristics of each illness and what part(s) of the body they affect will help determine the cause and appropriate treatment.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h2>Types of Rodent Illnesses in Cats</h2><p>There are a few rodent illnesses that may affect cats in the United States. The most serious are bacterial diseases, contracted by eating or being bitten by rodents. Parasites are a common and treatable concern, but the presence of these pests can be challenging and time-consuming to treat if a cat frequents the outdoors. Illness due to poisoning (eating a poisoned mouse, for instance) is also concerning because it can be fatal.</p><h3>Toxoplasmosis</h3><p>Toxoplasmosis is one of the most common parasitic diseases in cats. This infection is caused by the parasite. Toxoplasmosis can affect many animals, including humans. However, the cat is the ideal host for because it is the only animal in which this microscopic parasite can complete its life cycle.</p><p>Cats become infected by by ingesting the cysts of this parasite. Most often, this occurs when cats eat mice or rats infected with the parasite. However, they can also ingest it during grooming after coming in contact with infected soil or feces.</p><p>Cats infected with toxoplasmosis will often show no symptoms. In rare cases, cats will develop lethargy, gastrointestinal problems, or even respiratory issues. Many cats will remain silent carriers their whole lives.</p><p>Humans can contract toxoplasmosis after handling cat litter that contains the parasite and accidentally ingesting the microscopic cysts. They can also get it after touching and ingesting contaminated meat.</p><h3>Intestinal Parasites</h3><p>Many rodents are infected with common intestinal parasites like tapeworms, hookworms, and roundworms. Intestinal parasites can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and weight loss. Some intestinal parasites can be passed on to other pets or humans in the home.</p><p>If your cat goes outdoors or is known to catch vermin, routine fecal testing is recommended to check for the presence of intestinal parasites. Your veterinarian can prescribe anti-parasitic medications to de-worm your cat. In addition, some monthly heartworm and flea preventive medications will de-worm your cat with each dose.</p><h3>Plague Bacteria</h3><p>Some rodents carry the plague, an infection caused by the bacteria This is essentially the same bacteria responsible for causing the infamous ""black plague"" of the Middle Ages. Plague is often transmitted by fleas, but cats can be infected by eating the meat of infected rodents.</p><p>Cats infected with may experience lethargy, depression, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, muscle soreness, and fever. The cat may develop lymph node enlargement, lesions in the mouth, and weight loss.</p><p>Treatment involves the use of antibiotics and providing supportive care. The sooner treatment can begin, the better the odds of survival.</p><p>It is uncommon for humans to contract plague. When they do become infected, it is usually through a flea bite. Symptoms and treatment are relatively similar to those in cats.</p><h3>Hantavirus</h3><p>Several types of rodents are known to carry hantavirus. Cats can be infected by hantavirus but will show no symptoms, therefore the virus is not dangerous to them. In addition, cats cannot transmit hantavirus to people.</p><p>However, humans can be exposed through contact with infected rodents. Though serious complications from hantavirus are uncommon in humans, exposure can lead to a serious condition called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome.</p><h3>Tularemia</h3><p>Tularemia is a disease caused by the bacteria carried by rodents and rabbits. Though it is uncommon in cats of North America, it can affect them-most often in late spring and summer.</p><p>Commonly called ""rabbit fever,"" tularemia generally causes sudden high fever, large painful lymph nodes in the head and neck, abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowing of skin, mucous membranes, and the whites of the eyes), and organ failure.</p><p>Tularemia is diagnosed by laboratory tests such as a complete blood count (CBC), a blood chemistry panel, and a urinalysis. An ultrasound may be required to check for masses in a cat's internal organs.</p><p>This infection can be fatal, but cats can survive. Treatment must be early and aggressive, involving antibiotics and supportive care.</p><h3>Rodenticide Toxicity</h3><p>Rodenticide, or rat poison, is highly toxic to cats. This toxicity is not technically transmitted from rodents to cats; it results from contact with poisons designed to kill rodents. Cats may eat rat poison that has been placed in and around the house. More commonly, cats are exposed to poison after eating all or part of a rodent that has ingested it.</p><p>Rodenticide is dangerous to cats, even in small amounts. These poisons may cause lethargy, gastrointestinal upset, pale gums, loss of coordination, and seizures.</p><p>If you suspect your cat was exposed to rat poison, seek veterinary treatment immediately because aggressive treatment is often necessary. There are several types of rat poison, so symptoms and treatments will vary. Knowing the rodenticide your cat encountered will help determine the proper treatment.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Rodent Illnesses</h2><p>Cats can recover from rodent-borne illnesses, but the chances of survival are best with swift and aggressive treatment that is specific to the particular ailment. Delay in treatment can result in fatalities from bacterial infections (except hantavirus) or rodenticide exposure.</p><h2>How to Prevent Rodent Illnesses</h2><p>If you see your cat with a dead or dying rodent, try to remove the rodent to prevent your cat from eating it.</p>",990

More commonly what cats have is Pandora Syndrome which does not in most cases have a bacterial component and treatment consists of more than just an antibiotic.</p><p>Disease of the lower urinary tract is one of the most common problem in cats. It involves inflammation and discomfort in the bladder and the urethra which is the tube leading from the bladder out of the body. This has gone by various names, FLUTD (Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease) or FIC (Feline Idiopathic Cystitis, Idiopathic means the cause is unknown) and most recently, Pandora Syndrome.</p><p>Pandora syndrome, like the name implies, has no single cause. The underlying causes are likely due to multiple factors: among these include bladder and hormone abnormalities, neurological disorders, environmental stressors or trauma, infections, urinary stones, and/or rock-hard collections of minerals formed in the urinary tract of cats which obstructs the normal flow.</p><p>Cats with Pandora syndrome most often show signs of bladder inflammation, difficulty and pain when urinating, increased frequency of urination, urinating outside of the box and blood in the urine. Often cats who have Pandora Syndrome will have chronic urinary issues that wax and wane.</p><h2>Urethral Obstruction</h2><p>This condition, is most common in male cats, but can be seen in female cats as well. This is because the urethra of a male cat is much longer and much narrower than that of a female cat, and so is more susceptible to becoming blocked.</p><p>A urethral obstruction occurs when there is an obstruction in the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body. The obstruction can be due to several causes, including, obstructions such as urethral plugs, urinary stones, strictures, or tumors and can occur secondary to urethral spasm or swelling secondary to inflammation in the lower urinary tract. When this happens, it is difficult or impossible for a cat to empty the bladder, making it a life-threatening emergency. If you cat is having trouble urinating, they should be seen by a veterinarian immediately. Left untreated, the urethral obstruction can lead to kidney failure and death within 24 to 48 hours.</p><h2>Bladder Stones</h2><p>There are several types of minerals that form stones under different conditions in a cat 's urinary tract. The two most common are struvite and calcium oxalate stones. Crystals can be a normal finding in your cat 's urine at a low level but become problematic when the crystals combine to form grit or stones of varying shapes and sizes. These stones can be found in the urinary bladder, the urethra, or in the kidneys. In some cases, the stones can be flushed out of the body or dissolved. In other cases, they must be surgically removed. They occur in both male and female cats.</p><h2>Urinary Tract Infections</h2><p>Urinary tract infections (UTI) occur when bacteria enters the bladder, grows, and reproduces. This results in an infection since urine is normally sterile inside the bladder. Cats do not get urinary tract infections as often as they do some other urinary problems, but that doesn't mean they never happen.</p><h2>Housesoiling (urinating outside of the litterbox)</h2><p>Cats going to the bathroom outside of their litter boxes is a common complaint among owners. Contrary to popular opinion, cats do not do this to punish or spite their housemates. Instead, house-soiling is often due to a medical problem or fear, anxiety, and stress. Medical issues include constipation, pain, kidney disease, and more.</p><p>In many cases, a cat's litter box is not set up properly, which can lead to them not using it. One litter box does not fit all as there are preferences for cats. Here are a few tips on how to ensure you have the best litter box setup for your cat's needs.</p><h3>Choosing a Litter Box</h3><p>Size does matter when it comes to litter boxes-bigger is always better. Even the so-called ""large"" litter boxes sold in pet supply stores are too small for most cats. When choosing a box, your cat should be able to comfortably turn around in the box and, ideally, the box should be at least 1.5 times the length of the cat from nose to the base of the tail. Under the bed storage containers, 30-gallon storage containers, and cement mixing tubs are a few appropriately sized alternatives to their small commercial counterparts. When choosing boxes for small kittens, declawed, or senior cats, it's recommended to use low-sided boxes, or purchasing a storage container and cutting a low entry so that the cat can easily walk in and avoid lifting their legs high or jumping in, which can be painful.</p><p>The majority of cats are not fond of covered boxes for a variety of reasons. These boxes are often too small, and they trap odors and dust inside, which is very unpleasant for the cats. Cats are both prey and predator animals. Due to them being prey animals, asking them to go in a covered box where, from a cats perspective they cannot see possible predators and are made to feel exposed to threats is not ideal. A clear litter box can be helpful to make cats feel safer.</p><h3>Where to Place the Litter Box (and How Many to Purchase)</h3><p>The golden rule for the number of litter boxes in a house is one box per cat plus one. Remember, three boxes right next to each other are considered one box from a cat's perspective. Location of litter boxes is key in preventing litterbox aversions or accidents . Do not place litter boxes in the same area as your cat's food and water. You would not want to eat where you use the restroom and neither does your cat. Cats prefer to use their boxes in quiet and private places. When placing litter boxes, avoid high traffic areas and locations where a cat could be cornered or unable to flee (for example, if the box is in a closet where another cat or dog can block the exit). It's recommended that you avoid placing the boxes in busy areas or where a cat could be trapped by another cat or dog or a person.</p>",1084
72,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feline-cerebellar-hypoplasia-4171881,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h1>,"<h1>Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Feline cerebellar hypoplasia is a neurological disorder that occurs when a cat's brain does not develop properly in the womb. This disorder is congenital, meaning it is present at birth. A cat with cerebellar hypoplasia has an underdeveloped cerebellum, a part of the brain located in the back of the brain beneath the cerebrum. The cerebellum is responsible for coordination, spatial awareness, and fine motor skills. The characteristic symptoms of this disorder lead to its common name of ""wobbly cat syndrome.""</p><p>Feline cerebellar hypoplasia is not typically a life-threatening condition, but it can have a negative impact on the cat's quality of life depending on the severity.</p><h2>What Is Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia?</h2><p>""Hypoplasia"" is a medical term meaning underdevelopment or smaller size than normal. ""Cerebellar"" refers to the cerebellum (the word means ""little brain"" in Latin), which is located at the back, lower portion of the brain. The cerebellum in cats and other mammals mostly handles motor movements, particularly balance, the smooth performance of voluntary movements, and motor learning. In cerebellar hypoplasia, which occurs not only in cats, but also humans, dogs, cows, and many other mammal species, the cerebellum is underdeveloped from birth, leading to various symptoms of motor dysfunction.</p><p>Feline cerebellar hypoplasia is not a painful condition, nor is it contagious. Fortunately, cerebellar hypoplasia does not get worse over time. The condition will also not improve over time. However, most kittens learn to adapt as they age and can live happy healthy lives. In many cases, it may seem that the condition has improved because the cat has done such a great job adapting to it. In severe cases, the cat may need a lot of assistance with normal tasks such as walking or using the litter box. This still doesn't mean the cat cannot experience a good quality of life.</p><h2>Symptoms of Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h2><p>Signs of cerebellar hypoplasia are generally first detected when the kitten begins walking, typically around four to six weeks of age. Cases of feline cerebellar hypoplasia range from mild to severe.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Cats with cerebellar hypoplasia often have trouble walking, running, keeping balanced, jumping, and locating objects. They often bob their heads and appear wobbly when walking. Some will experience splaying of their limbs or slide on their feet. They may have trouble focusing on objects and approaching them accurately, especially when it comes to litter boxes, waters bowls, and food dishes. Tremors often occur when the cat reaches for an object or focuses on something, such as a toy, food bowl, or even your petting hand.</p><h2>Causes of Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h2><p>Because the cerebellum continues to develop and mature not only during fetal development but also during the first two weeks of a kitten's life, it is very vulnerable to disruption from a variety of causes. In the case of cerebellar hypoplasia in cats, the culprit is the feline distemper virus, a type of parvovirus that causes the disease panleukopenia. If the mother cat is infected with this virus during her pregnancy or receives a vaccination for feline distemper that's made with live virus, the virus can attack the developing nerves in the fetal kittens' growing cerebellums, leading to stunted development.</p><p>Feline cerebellar hypoplasia can also occur in kittens who become infected with the parvovirus before they are two weeks old.</p><h2>Diagnosing Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h2><p>There is no simple test to diagnose cerebellar hypoplasia in cats. However, your veterinarian may recommend a series of tests to rule out more serious conditions. Your vet will likely start with routine lab work like blood chemistry, complete blood count, and urinalysis. These tests may reveal metabolic problems, organ dysfunction, or abnormal cells in the blood or urine.</p><p>Your primary vet may refer you to a veterinary specialist, like a neurologist, to pursue further testing. The best way to rule out other major neurological conditions is for a veterinary specialist to conduct a CT or MRI scan. A cerebrospinal fluid tap may also be recommended to look for bacterial or viral infections. The CT or MRI may show brain abnormalities including but not limited to cerebellar hypoplasia.</p><p>However, advanced diagnostics are not always necessary. Perhaps your budget is tight or you don't want your cat to undergo a lot of testing. Your vet may be able to make a presumptive diagnosis based on your cat's symptoms, and then offer options for helping your cat lead a normal life.</p><h2>Treatment for Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h2><p>There is no cure or direct treatment for feline cerebellar hypoplasia. Sadly, euthanasia may be the most humane option for cats with very severe cerebellar hypoplasia. The good news is that most cats with mild to moderate cerebellar hypoplasia can lead relatively normal lives with a little extra help from their owners.</p><p>For their own safety, cats with cerebellar hypoplasia should never be allowed to go outdoors. They should not be declawed, as they need all their claws to help keep their balance. Their nails should be kept a little longer than you would keep them on the average cat. This will help them gain traction around the house.</p><p>Cats with cerebellar hypoplasia do best with large litter boxes that are easy to get in and out of. Ramps placed in front of litter boxes and furniture can make it much easier for cats to access these areas. For safety, place baby gates at steps to prevent falls. Avoid giving easy access to very high places, as these cats are more likely to fall. Help create traction where there are slick floors by laying down yoga mats or foam pads. Use nonslip mats for the food and water bowls and keep a nonslip standing surface in front of the bowls to help your cat balance while eating. Wide bowls for food and water may be easier for cats to access.</p><p>Be sure to carefully introduce new cats and other pets to your cat with cerebellar hypoplasia. These cats can certainly live with ""normal"" animals, but they may be more vulnerable if the pets are not getting along. Supervise all interactions until you are sure they are used to one another. In general, it's best not to leave a cat with cerebellar hypoplasia alone with a larger dog. Dogs, especially those with higher prey drives, may perceive the cat as prey in distress and chase or attack out of instinct.</p><h2>Prognosis for Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h2><p>A cat with mild to moderate cerebellar hypoplasia may be more accident-prone than the average cat, but there's a high likelihood the cat can learn to adapt and compensate for the differences and live a long happy life. A little help from you will go a long way.</p><h2>Prevention of Feline Cerebellar Hypoplasia</h2><p>It is not always possible to prevent feline cerebellar hypoplasia but to help reduce the chance of it occurring, make sure unspayed female cats are vaccinated against feline distemper before becoming pregnant. Should an unvaccinated cat become pregnant, wait until after the kittens are born to vaccinate against feline distemper.</p>",1146
73,https://www.thesprucepets.com/urinary-tract-infections-in-cats-5271026,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Urinary Tract Infections in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Urinary Tract Infections in Cats</h1><p>Though less common than most people assume, urinary tract infections(UTIs) can affect cats. As is the case in humans, female cats are more likely to suffer from UTIs than males due to the length of their urethra. UTIs, as well as other urinary issues, cause a variety of symptoms that cat owners should learn to recognize in order to get their cat the help it needs and prevent complications.</p><h2>What Are Urinary Tract Infections in Cats?</h2><p>Urinary tract infections occur when bacteria enter the urethra and bladder and multiply. This presence of bacteria may result in an infection if the body's defenses don't clear it quickly. Since the urine and bladder are normally sterile, the presence of bacteria there is abnormal. There are other urinary issues that are much more common in cats that cause similar clinical signs, so it is important to always have your cat checked out by their veterinarian if urinary issues are seen.</p><h3>Signs of UTIs in Cats</h3><p>Cats that have urinary tract infections are likely to be uncomfortable when they urinate. This discomfort or pain may sometimes cause them to cry or vocalize when they urinate. Straining to urinate and urinating small amounts frequently is also commonly seen.</p><p>A cat with a urinary tract infection may also lick at its genitals in an attempt to ease the discomfort and will also often urinate outside of the box. This may occur on the floor right beside the litter box or in other places such as the bathtub or carpet.</p><p>Some cats with urinary tract infections will also have blood in their urine and this may be seen in the litter box or on the floor, but can be hard to see in clumping litter.</p><h2>Causes of UTIs in Cats</h2><p>UTIs are caused by bacteria in the bladder. Typically, bacteria enter the bladder through the cat's urethra, which is the path urine takes from the bladder to exit the body. There is most often something amiss that prohibits the body 's natural defenses from being able to avoid and eliminate the bacteria. This may be stress, another illness, certain medications, abnormalities in their urinary tract anatomy or function, or an immune system disorder.</p><p>Once in the bladder, if the bacteria evade the cat 's natural defenses, they grow and reproduce to create more bacteria. This overgrowth of bacteria and the toxins they release affect the bladder wall, as well as the urethra, and results in pain and inflammation.</p><h2>Diagnosing UTIs in Cats</h2><p>If a cat owner is observing signs of abnormal urination in their cat they should schedule a visit with their cat's veterinarian. A urine sample will need to be collected either by the owner at home with the use of special, non-absorbent litter, or by the veterinarian.</p><p>The veterinarian may temporarily keep the cat in the animal hospital until it urinates on its own in some non-absorbable litter or the urine may be obtained by cystocentesis. Cystocentesis is a procedure that involves collecting a sterile urine sample directly from the bladder via a needle. This procedure is the preferred method for urine collection if a UTI is suspected because it is the only way to obtain a sample without contamination. However, the procedure does come with some risk and the decision should be made with the guidance of your veterinarian.</p><p>Alternatively, it may be possible to obtain a sample by allowing the cat to urinate in a clean litter box filled with non-absorbent granules.</p><p>Once the urine is obtained a urinalysis will be performed. A complete urinalysis checks the urine for bacteria, crystals, blood, abnormal pH levels, abnormal specific gravity, glucose, white blood cells, and other things to aid the veterinarian in making a diagnosis. If bacteria and white blood cells are present in the urine, a urinary tract infection is diagnosed. It is recommended to then culture the urine so the causative bacteria may be identified and tested for its susceptibility to certain antibiotics. This will guide the treatment of the infection for your cat.</p><h2>Treating UTIs in Cats</h2><p>Antibiotics will be prescribed to kill the bacteria in the bladder and symptomatic treatment may also be necessary to ease a cat's discomfort. This usually includes pain medications. Probiotics may also be recommended to restore a healthy population of bacteria in the gut after the antibiotics since beneficial bacteria may also be wiped out by a broad-spectrum antibiotic.</p><p>The choice of antibiotic should be guided by the culture and sensitivity results, however, ease of administration, such as pills vs. liquid vs. injection, may also play a role in addition to any underlying conditions your cat may have.</p><h2>How to Prevent UTIs in Cats</h2><p>It is important to note that UTIs are less common in cats. It is often more likely that another urinary issue is affecting your cat. UTIs most often occur when something else is affecting the cat 's natural defenses such as an autoimmune issue, bladder stones, or diabetes mellitus. These conditions will need to be addressed along with the UTI.</p><p>To encourage urinary tract health, all cats should be offered fresh water at all times and encouraged to drink. Canned or moist food is ideal for cats because it has more water content, and for cats with recurrent urinary issues, it may be recommended to add additional water to their canned food as well.</p><h2>Other Types of Urinary Tract Problems in Cats</h2><p>If your cat is straining, crying when urinating, urinating outside of the box, or having blood in its urine, it may very well have a condition that is not a UTI.</p><p>Feline Urological Syndrome (FUS) - Also referred to as sterile cystitis, this is a sterile inflammation of the bladder that is incredibly common in cats. The exact cause for this inflammation is unknown but is likely multi-factorial including stress, genetics, diet, anatomy, and lifestyle. This is a disorder that cannot be cured but requires management in the form of stress reduction, special diets, medications, and sometimes surgery.</p><p>Urinary Tract Blockage- More often a problem in male cats, the urethra may become blocked with grit and other debris and the cat will be unable to urinate. This is an emergency! Steps must immediately be taken to unblock the cat to avoid kidney failure and death. Any cat with urinary tract symptoms that is not urinating for more than eight hours or only producing small drops of urine should be seen by a vet right away.</p>",1055
74,https://www.thesprucepets.com/jaundice-in-cats-5186415,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Jaundice in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Jaundice in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Jaundice, also known as icterus, is a symptom of more serious diseases that causes parts of your cat's body to turn yellow. This condition can be alarming to pet owners, and cats that present this symptom should see a veterinarian as soon as possible. Some breeds of cats are pre-disposed to developing a disease that can cause jaundice. These include the Siamese and Oriental Shorthair cats, or Abyssinians and Somali cats. There are several reasons why a cat may develop jaundice, but some are more commonly seen than others. These causes typically relate to liver disease, red blood cells, gallbladder disease, and other organs. If left untreated, the underlying causes of this symptom can be fatal, so it should not be ignored.</p><h2>What Is Jaundice?</h2><p>Jaundice is the yellowing of the skin, eyes, ears, and gums, and it is a sign that the cat has another disease. This condition affects the production of bilirubin in the body, which causes excessive yellow pigment in the blood and tissues when accumulated. If your cat has another disease that relates to the liver, jaundice may begin presenting as well. Knowing more about the diagnosis and treatment of this condition in cats can help you know when it's time to seek help from your veterinarian.</p><h2>Symptoms of Jaundice in Cats</h2><p>Because jaundice is a sign of other diseases, it may be accompanied by more symptoms caused by the undiagnosed condition.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Yellowed Skin, Eyes, Ears, and Gums</h3><p>Jaundice can be difficult for some cat owners to notice if their cat has a lot of fur, but the inside of the ears, the whites of the eyes, and the gums are the easiest places to see the yellow discoloration.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>Cats can become lethargic when they don't feel well. You may notice that your cat is less playful than usual, sleeps more often, or moves slower around the house due to discomfort from other symptoms.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite</h3><p>Also referred to as anorexia, loss of appetite is common with several different diseases that relate to jaundice. Going without food can also be a cause of jaundice, as hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease) causes the liver to convert fat into energy, which leads to an accumulation of fat in the cells.</p><h3>Vomiting and Diarrhea</h3><p>You may notice changes in your cat's stool or the onset of vomiting episodes. While vomiting and diarrhea can be caused by a wide variety of feline health conditions, these symptoms may also begin alongside jaundice when your pet has an underlying disease.</p><h3>Frequent Urination</h3><p>Your cat may become dehydrated, leading to excessive water drinking and frequent urination. This can be seen in conjunction with a loss of appetite.</p><h2>Causes of Jaundice</h2><p>The causes of jaundice are classified as being pre-hepatic, hepatic, or post-hepatic, but all are a result of hyperbilirubinemia. Hyperbilirubinemia is an abnormally high blood level of bilirubin, a component of red blood cells. It is caused by liver disease, gallbladder disease, or red blood cell destruction. Bilirubin is a brown to yellow substance that comes from bile. It is normally excreted in the feces of a cat when the normal process of old red blood cells dying occurs, but if the liver isn't able to get rid of the bilirubin properly, then jaundice can occur.</p><p>While these conditions can affect any cat, some breeds (including Siamese and Oriental Shorthair cats, or Abyssinians and Somali cats) may be more likely to develop diseases that lead to jaundice. If your cat is one of these breeds, your veterinarian may recommend regular checkups to catch any health issues early.</p><h2>Diagnosing Jaundice in Cats</h2><p>Your veterinarian will obtain a full patient history and perform a full physical examination before checking your cat's bloodwork to aid in their diagnosis. First, they'll verify whether the disease is pre-hepatic, hepatic, or post-hepatic to determine which additional tests are needed to diagnose a specific cause.</p><p>Various information (including bilirubin levels, liver enzyme levels, and details about your cat's blood cells) will be assessed in a complete blood count and biochemistry screening. X-rays, ultrasounds, and fine needle aspirates or biopsies of the liver may also be recommended depending on the results of the bloodwork.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The treatment of jaundice will depend on its cause, but your cat may need to be hospitalized. Supportive care and treatment may include IV fluids, antibiotics, vitamin K, anti-emetics, pain medications, supplements like silybin and SAMe, and even assisted feeding. On occasion, surgery may be indicated if a mass or ruptured gall bladder is suspected.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Jaundice</h2><p>Like treatment, the prognosis for your specific cat can vary because there are several different diseases that lead to jaundice. Many cats can recover fully from the underlying condition that caused their skin and tissue to become yellowed. However, some cases of jaundice are unfortunately related to fatal diseases. Your veterinarian will provide details about your cat's diagnostics after examination to determine an accurate prognosis.</p><h2>How to Prevent Jaundice</h2> <h3>Prevent Exposure to Risks</h3><p>Keep all medications, household chemicals, and toxic houseplants out of your cat's reach. Since jaundice can develop from ingesting substances that are toxic to their bodies, this simple method can be effective at preventing a number of diseases. Owners should also avoid exposing their cats to other cats with FIV, FeLV, or FIP.</p><h3>Monitor Eating</h3><p>Ensure your cat does not go more than a day without eating. This can overwhelm the liver and cause your cat to develop hepatic lipidosis (fatty liver disease), which leads to jaundice. On the other hand, your cat should also not be allowed to become obese. Maintaining a normal weight is an important part of overall health.</p><h3>Medical Prevention</h3><p>Keep your cat's vaccinations up to date and have their bloodwork screened regularly. It's also important to use parasite prevention medication. If you are concerned about liver and gallbladder disease in your cat, ask your vet about supplements and special diets to help support these organs.</p>",963

In this condition, the muscles in the esophagus do not contract normally, and the esophagus becomes enlarged, weak, and flaccid. The inability of the muscles to contract normally is a problem called dysmotility or hypomotility. Food may pool in the esophagus and cats will regurgitate undigested food back up shortly after trying to eat.</p><h2>Symptoms of Megaesophagus in Cats</h2><p>Depending on the underlying cause, symptoms of megaesophagus may be present in kittens, or may develop later in cats of any age. In cases where an animal is regurgitating food and water, megaesophagus should be highly suspected as a potential cause.</p><h3>Regurgitation</h3><p>Regurgitation is the most common symptom of megaesophagus. Regurgitation can look similar to vomiting, and it is important to try to distinguish between the two. Regurgitation is a passive process, where a cat may appear to spit up food or water with little effort after eating or drinking. Regurgitation may occur within minutes of eating or a few hours later. By contrast, vomiting is an active process involving abdominal muscle contractions, which may be prolonged, before food or liquid is brought up from the stomach. Vomited food may be semi-digested. Cats about to vomit may become restless, lick their lips repeatedly, and make gagging sounds, but these actions are not associated with regurgitation.</p><h3>Difficulty Swallowing</h3><p>Because food can 't move normally down the throat when megaesophagus is present, cats will have difficulty swallowing food and water. Cats may repeatedly attempt to swallow and food may drop out of their mouths when they are trying to eat. Some cats may also become distressed while eating.</p><h3>Cough or Difficulty Breathing</h3><p>Cats with megaesophagus are at high risk of aspiration pneumonia, which may present as a cough, trouble breathing, lethargy, fever and/or an unusually fast respiratory rate. Aspiration pneumonia occurs when regurgitation causes food or water to be inadvertently inhaled into the respiratory tract. This causes inflammation and infection in the lungs and can lead to a serious, life-threatening pneumonia.</p><h3>Excessive Salivation/Drooling</h3><p>Cats are unable to swallow their saliva and may show symptoms of excessive drooling and constant wet fur and skin around the mouth, neck, and chest.</p><h3>Weight Loss</h3><p>Megaesophagus prevents the normal digestion of food, since food can 't reach the stomach to be broken down and used by the cat 's body for nutrients. As a result, cats with megaesophagus become malnourished and start losing weight. They may have poor body condition, ungroomed fur, and low energy as well.</p><h3>Failure to Gain Weight</h3><p>Kittens with congenital megaesophagus&ndash;which means the condition is present from birth&ndash;will fail to gain weight normally compared to other kittens of the same age. They may appear smaller than other littermates, or may be weak and thin.</p><h3>Nasal Discharge</h3><p>Nasal discharge may be present if infection or inflammation in the sinuses occurs. This may be due to regurgitation leading to respiratory infections and pneumonia, as well as their overall poor health making them more susceptible to infectious diseases. Cats may sneeze, cough, and/or have persistent nasal discharge.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p>Cats with aspiration pneumonia may have a fever due to the infection. Symptoms of a fever include low energy, not wanting to move or interact, loss of appetite, and hiding.</p><h3>Bulge in the Throat</h3><p>Food may collect in the esophagus, causing a distended or swollen appearance in the neck. This is only rarely observed and would be most evident in the lower portion of the neck close to where it meets the shoulder, known as the thoracic inlet.</p><h2>Causes of Megaesophagus</h2><p>Megaesophagus is caused by either congenital or acquired conditions. Congenital conditions are present at birth, may be inherited, and are usually present in young kittens. These conditions often become most evident when kittens are weaned and start eating solid food.</p><p>Acquired conditions most often develop later in juvenile and adult cats. Megaesophagus can also be idiopathic, which means the condition arises but the cause is not known.</p> <h2>Diagnosing Megaesophagus in Cats</h2><p>If your cat is showing symptoms of megaesophagus, your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination and conduct additional tests to determine if an underlying cause can be identified.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If the underlying cause of the megaesophagus can be identified, it should be treated. Depending on the cause, specific treatment may involve medication or surgery to correct the condition. For example, abnormal blood vessels that constrict the esophagus, called vascular ring anomalies, can be treated with surgery. Regardless of the underlying cause, most cats will likely need lifelong support to deal with the symptoms of megaesophagus.</p><p>Treatment of megaesophagus, whether the cause is known or unknown, requires supportive care to help cats eat and reduce the risk of complications like aspiration pneumonia. Cats must be fed multiple, small meals of a high-calorie gruel. Food bowls must be elevated so cats stand on their hind feet while eating. This position uses the assistance of gravity to help move food down into the stomach. Cats must remain in an elevated position for 30 minutes after feeding. You can accomplish this by holding your cat upright in your arms or over your shoulder, or carrying your cat in a sling.</p><p>Your veterinarian may also prescribe medications that increase the movement of the esophagus, antibiotics to treat infections, and antacids if inflammation is present in the esophagus.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Megaesophagus</h2><p>The prognosis for megaesophagus depends on the underlying condition and whether it is treatable. Complications like aspiration pneumonia, dehydration, and malnutrition worsen the prognosis. Some forms of congenital megaesophagus may improve with age, but idiopathic megaesophagus generally has a poor prognosis, particularly if there are associated complications. If the underlying cause can be treated and cured, symptoms of megaesophagus can resolve. In other cases, megaesophagus in cats may be progressive, leading to early deaths.</p>",964
76,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feline-chin-acne-possible-causes-signs-treatment-3384889,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Chin Acne in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Chin Acne in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Feline chin acne is a fairly common skin condition in cats causing blackheads and blocked hair follicles, and it can be a one-time occurrence, occasional flare, or chronic issue. There appears to be no rhyme or reason regarding the age, breed, or sex of cats affected by chin acne, but it may be related to poor grooming habits along with stress, viral infection, immunosuppression, or feline allergies. Some sources also suggest that it is more common in cats between two and four years old because of hormones. While this condition is mostly unsightly to look at, it can progress to painful, draining pustules that are itchy and irritating to the cat when left untreated. Luckily, it's usually simple to treat with help from your veterinarian.</p><h2>What Is Feline Chin Acne?</h2><p>Chin acne in cats is a condition that occurs when the hair follicles around a cat 's oil-producing sebaceous glands become clogged. Besides knowing that the follicles become blocked, little is understood about this condition. Research has shown that chin acne develops because of follicular keratinization, but little is known about what causes the excess production of keratin. If the extra keratin-a protein found in the outer layer of skin-is trapped in the hair follicles, comedones (or blackheads) form. Pustules (pimples) may form if bacteria infect the comedones, appearing similar to acne in people.</p><h2>Symptoms of Chin Acne in Cats</h2><p>Your cat may appear to be irritated and scratch at its chin more regularly than usual.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The most common sign of feline chin acne is the appearance of a dirty chin, especially noted in light-colored or white cats. The small black specks are comedones, and careful examination will reveal the blackheads and inflamed hair follicles. Although most commonly appearing on the chin, acne can also pop up on the upper and lower lips. If the blackheads become infected, swollen, inflamed bumps can appear, which may rupture and drain. Cats with chronic cases of acne may have hard, crusty lesions that are painful to the touch.</p><h2>Causes of Feline Chin Acne</h2> <p>A distinct correlation has appeared between feline chin acne and the use of plastic food and water dishes. It was originally thought that a contact allergy to the plastic material caused acne, but now it is believed that an excessive amount of bacteria resides on plastic dishes, leading to acne development. Plastic is much more difficult to clean by hand than glass, ceramic, or stainless steel, as tiny abrasions on the surface can easily trap bacteria. Avoid this potential issue by switching your cat 's dishes to an impermeable material and washing frequently if the cat is prone to developing acne on its chin.</p><p>Allergies appear to be another common culprit for chin acne development. Pets ' allergies tend to manifest in their skin. If your cat is allergic to an ingredient in its diet or a substance in its environment, you may notice chin acne, in addition to inflamed skin, itching, licking, chewing, ear infections, and hair loss.</p><h2>Diagnosing Chin Acne in Cats</h2><p>If your cat has developed blackheads or sores on its chin, a veterinary visit is necessary for treatment to prevent further progression. At your cat 's appointment, your veterinarian will likely rule out a variety of potential issues, such as mange mites, fleas, fungal infections, allergies, and bacterial infections. Besides a thorough physical exam, your veterinarian may perform a skin scraping to check for mites, skin cytology to search for bacteria or yeast, or a dermatophyte culture to rule out ringworm.</p><p>If the sores appear suspicious and do not have a typical chin-acne appearance, your veterinarian will likely recommend a biopsy to check for cancer, immune-mediated diseases, or neoplastic causes.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Most feline chin acne treatments revolve around improved hygiene to manage the condition, rather than curing it.</p> <h2>Prognosis for Cats With Chin Acne</h2><p>While chin acne can't always be completely removed, this condition is not typically harmful to the cat unless an infection occurs. Your veterinarian will help you manage the cat's condition by starting a variety of treatments to minimize the symptoms. Topical medications, systemic medications, and improved hygiene all have favorable results in most cases. However, some cats might not respond to treatment as well as others. In these cases, more aggressive treatment will be required.</p><h2>How to Prevent Feline Chin Acne</h2><p>There are several ways that pet owners can help prevent their cats from developing chin acne. Speak with your veterinarian before beginning any at-home care regimens, as some human products are toxic to cats. This condition isn't always entirely avoidable, especially when caused by other diseases, but the following methods may reduce your cat's risk.</p><h3>Switch Food Bowls</h3><p>One of the best ways to prevent feline chin acne is to switch from plastic bowls to ceramic, glass, or stainless steel. Clean the bowls daily after your cat eats and drinks from them to remove harmful bacteria from building up. It's especially important to keep your cat's area clean and sanitary when it's dealing with infections.</p><h3>Minimize Stress</h3><p>Take steps to minimize your cat 's stress, which can lead to the development of chin acne or worsening symptoms. Provide your cat with calm, quiet places to relax and avoid triggers that lead to the cat's anxiety.</p><h3>Improve Hygiene</h3><p>Although feline chin acne is a puzzling condition that can be difficult to eradicate, good hygiene habits and prompt intervention can help clear up your kitty 's blackheads. Monitor your cat to determine if it's grooming itself regularly. This will help promote healthy skin and fur, which will decrease the chances of clogged hair follicles.</p><h3>Check for Allergies</h3><p>If your cat's acne isn't clearing up from a few lifestyle changes, talk to your veterinarian about checking the cat for allergies. Some food allergies may lead to chin acne becoming worse, so changing diets or removing household irritants can be helpful.</p>",957
77,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ringworm-in-cats-4175211,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Ringworm in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Ringworm in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Ringworm is often seen in cats, even indoor cats. But despite the name, it doesn't involve any worms. Ringworm is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, fur, and claws. It can cause crusty and bald patches and itchiness. Left untreated, it can spread across the body and cause open sores, especially in animals with weak immune systems. Cats can pick it up from other animals that have ringworm, as well as from the environment where an infected animal has been. Not only can cats spread it among themselves, but it is also contagious to other animals and humans. Fortunately, even though this disease is highly contagious, it is also very treatable.</p><h2>What Is Ringworm?</h2><p>Ringworm is a fungal infection that affects many different species of animals. It's also referred to as dermatophytosis. In cats, about 98% of ringworm cases are caused by the easily transmitted fungus . The fungi feed on keratin in the fur, skin, and nails. Ringworm gets its name from the red, ring-shaped rash that it sometimes causes. However, some infected cats only have very minor symptoms.</p><h2>Symptoms of Ringworm in Cats</h2><p>Ringworm symptoms range from very mild to severe. They commonly show up on the head, tail, and feet of cats but can affect other body parts as well.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Lisa Zins / Flickr / CC BY 2.0</p><h3>Red Rings on the Skin</h3><p>Cats don 't always have the classic ring-shaped infected area, but it is possible. The circular area will typically lose its fur, and the skin will appear rough and scaly.</p><h3>Hair Loss</h3><p>In addition to the circular spots of hair loss, ringworm also can cause irregular patches of hair loss throughout the body.</p><h3>Scaly or Flaky Skin</h3><p>Ringworm can cause scaly or flaky skin with or without hair loss. The coat might simply look like it has a lot of dandruff.</p><h3>Lesions and Sores</h3><p>Besides the red rings, more irregular raised lesions can occur throughout the body. Also, in more severe cases, cats can have relatively large lesions and open sores.</p><h3>Itchiness</h3><p>Not all bumps and lesions that come with ringworm are itchy, but they can be. Itching in a specific area sometimes can help owners find a ringworm case in its early stages.</p><h3>Deformed Nails</h3><p>When ringworm affects nails, they can take on a rough, pitted appearance. Eventually, they can look scaly and deformed.</p><h2>Causes of Ringworm</h2><p>Cats can carry the fungal spores of ringworm and show symptoms of the disease, or they might not show any symptoms at all. Either way, spores can spread to other cats quite easily.</p><p>Exposure doesn't always result in a case of ringworm. Animals with weak immune systems, as well as those with skin sensitivities, are especially prone to ringworm.</p><h2>Diagnosing Ringworm in Cats</h2> <p>These different tests will verify that your cat has ringworm. Your vet will then be able to treat the fungal infection with appropriate medication. Your vet might also ask whether you have any lesions or other skin abnormalities similar to your cat's, as you've likely been exposed to the fungus.</p><p>Ringworm lesions can look similar to other issues, which is why it might be necessary for your veterinarian to run more than one test. For example, fleas and mange can cause hair loss and itching. Plus, some cats will lick their fur off and irritate their skin until it's red due to allergies or stress and anxiety. A misdiagnosis can mean your cat will be given the wrong kind of medication.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If your veterinarian has diagnosed your cat with ringworm, they'll likely prescribe an antifungal medication to treat the infection. Itraconazole is a frequently used medication for pets with ringworm. Sometimes topical ointments are used to treat ringworm in conjunction with oral treatments. By using both oral and topical treatment regimens, you'll kill both the spores on the skin and suppress the infection in the cat systemically.</p><p>Finally, if you have a cat with ringworm, you'll need to treat your home environment to kill any spores. Use a diluted bleach solution on surfaces after your general cleaning routine. It can be helpful to restrict your cat to a small, easy-to-clean area until it is no longer infected.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Ringworm</h2><p>Most cats recover from ringworm infections, though it can take some time. In general, the lesions can take more than a week before they show improvement from treatment. Also, inadequate treatment or stopping treatment too soon can cause a relapse. After a course of treatment, your vet might perform another test to make sure the ringworm has cleared up and your pet is no longer contagious. Until you know this, minimize contact between your pet and any other people and pets in the house, and keep its area sanitary.</p><h2>How to Prevent Ringworm</h2><p>Ringworm is highly contagious, but it's also preventable if the appropriate steps are taken. Washing your hands before and after handling your pet is the easiest way to decrease the likelihood of you or your cat becoming infected with ringworm. Aside from that, don't let your cat play with cats that don't live within your household. Maintain a sanitary living environment for you and your cat. And if you have ringworm, refrain from touching your cat until your doctor has determined that you're free of the infection.</p><h2>Is Ringworm Contagious to Other Animals?</h2><p>Ringworm in cats is contagious to other animals. They'll either acquire it from direct or indirect contact with the infected animal. Ringworm can live for up to 18 months in the environment on items such as brushes, pet beds, furniture, carpeting, and bowls. So if you have an infected animal or suspect a case, immediately separate its items from any other pets you have.</p><h2>Is It Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>Ringworm is a zoonotic disease, which means it can spread from an animal to a human. A ringworm infection in a person typically occurs after a person has touched an infected or carrier cat. But it can also occur after simply handling items that were used by an infected cat. Immune-compromised individuals are more prone to contracting ringworm. Hand-washing and maintaining sanitary conditions can help to prevent the spread.</p>",997
78,https://www.thesprucepets.com/treating-anemia-in-cats-4778887,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Anemia in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Anemia in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Anemia is not a disease on its own, but rather, is a sign that there is an underlying health problem of some kind. This blood disorder occurs when an animal 's red blood cell count drops lower than normal. This decrease can be from blood loss, a decrease in the number of red blood cells produced, or an increase in the number of red blood cells destroyed by the body. Many diseases and health issues can cause a cat to become anemic.</p><p>Because red blood cells help transport oxygen to cells and tissues throughout the cat's body, if the red blood cell count drops quickly or gets very low, the cat will show signs of oxygen deprivation, which can include lethargy, pale gums, increased heart rate, and difficulty breathing.</p><p>Although the outlook for anemic cats depends on the underlying condition, most cats will recover with treatment and go on to lead normal and happy lives.</p><h2>What Is Anemia?</h2><p>Anemia is a common blood disorder not just in cats, but also in dogs, humans, and many other animals. An anemic cat or other animal has too few red blood cells circulating in its blood, or too little hemoglobin within its red blood cells. Hemoglobin, a type of protein, is the component of red blood cells that binds to oxygen and carries it to the cells throughout the body.</p><p>Anemia in cats is typically broken down into two broad categories: regenerative and nonregenerative. In regenerative types of anemia, red blood cells are lost or destroyed. In nonregenerative types of anemia, the production of red blood cells is suppressed. Both categories of anemia have many underlying causes.</p><h2>Symptoms of Anemia in Cats</h2><p>Symptoms of anemia can vary based on the underlying issue that's causing the problem, but there are some general symptoms to watch for. Two of the most common signs of long-term anemia in cats are lethargy-you'll notice your cat seems more tired than usual, or isn't interested in things that it used to enjoy doing-and pale gums.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>If you take a peek into your anemic cat's mouth, you'll probably notice that its gums are paler than normal, and may appear almost white. This is due to a lack of red blood cells.</p><p>An anemic cat's heart rate also increases in an effort to get oxygen to the cells that need it. You might see your cat's breathing rate speed up in an effort to bring more oxygen into the body. Most likely, your pet will appear lethargic and won't be as interested in playing, grooming, or socializing as usual, as reduced oxygen levels leave muscles weaker than normal.</p><p>Some cats also lose their appetite when they're anemic and may drink more in an effort to replace lost blood volume. In severe cases, when a cat has lost a lot of blood, it may be unable to move or can become unresponsive due to a lack of oxygen to the brain.</p><p>If your cat is showing any of these symptoms, it should be evaluated immediately by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Causes of Anemia</h2><p>The usual lifespan of a circulating red blood cell is only two months, so the cat's body must continually produce new red blood cells to replace the old ones. The different causes of anemia are grouped based on whether the anemia is regenerative, meaning the underlying condition is causing red blood cells to be lost or destroyed faster than they can be replaced, or nonregenerative, meaning the underlying condition is suppressing the normal production of new red blood cells.</p><h3>Causes of Regenerative Anemia</h3><h3>Causes of Nonregenerative Anemia</h3><h2>Diagnosing Anemia in Cats</h2><p>The diagnosis of anemia in cats is fairly straightforward. A blood test called a complete blood count (CBC) is the basic test used for evaluation. There are several components to a CBC. One is a count of white blood cells, which can be useful in diagnosing infections. However, it's the tests evaluating the red blood cells that are of most interest when a cat has symptoms of anemia.</p><p>Hematocrit: One component of the CBC is the hematocrit, which measures what percentage of a blood sample's volume is red blood cells. Normally, this should be around 25 to 45 percent, although different laboratories can have slightly different ranges. If the hematocrit is below 25 percent, a diagnosis of anemia is made.</p><p>Red blood cell count: The red blood cell count is another CBC component your vet will consider. This measures the actual amount of red blood cells in the blood sample. A typical normal range is 6.1-11.9 x 10<sup>6</sup>/&micro; l for cats. Anemic cats will be low in total red blood cells.</p><p>Hemoglobin: This is another important component of the CBC. This test measures how much hemoglobin the red blood cells contain. It's also usually low in an anemic cat. A typical normal range for cats is 9-15.6 g/dl.</p><p>Additional blood tests: Your veterinarian will probably also run other blood tests to check for your cat's overall health condition, as well as specialized tests to determine or rule out kidney disease and infectious diseases such as feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) because these viruses are frequent causes of anemia.</p><p>Fecal test: A fecal test will often be performed to check for intestinal parasites causing internal blood loss, as well. Occasionally, your vet might want to use a long needle to draw a sample of bone marrow to determine if the problem is due to a disorder of the marrow.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If the cat's anemia is severe enough to be life-threatening, an emergency blood transfusion and supplemental oxygen are usually required. For cats with mild to moderate anemia, however, treatment will focus not on the anemia itself, but on the underlying condition causing the problem. Your veterinarian will determine the necessary treatment for your cat's specific condition.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Anemia</h2><p>Because there are so many underlying causes for anemia, it's difficult to generalize about the prognosis, but for most cats with mild anemia and simple underlying issues, the prognosis is quite good. For cats that have suffered severe trauma, however, or have ingested toxins, have cancer, or are in late-stage kidney disease, the prognosis is much more grave.</p>",1011

In some cases, the stones can be flushed out of the body or dissolved. In other cases, they must be surgically removed. They occur in both male and female cats.</p><h2>What Are Struvite Crystals?</h2><p>Struvite crystals are microscopic crystals that are found in the urine of some cats. Struvite specifically is a material that is composed of magnesium, ammonium, and phosphate. Struvite and struvite crystals can be a normal finding in your cat 's urine at a low level but become problematic when the crystals combine to form grit or stones of varying shapes and sizes. These stones can be found in the urinary bladder, the urethra, or the kidneys.</p><h2>Symptoms of Struvite Stones in Cats</h2><p>Some cats may not show symptoms immediately or minimal symptoms and may be found when your veterinarian is performing tests for another condition.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3> <h3>Urinating Outside the Litterbox</h3><p>A cat experiencing crystals and possible stones may try to handle the discomfort by avoiding the litterbox since it may cause pain to sit on the specific type of litter you provide in the box.</p><h3>Urinating Small Amounts of Urine</h3><p>In many cases, stones can cause painful inflammation and irritation to the urethra and/or bladder wall and urinary blockage can occur, which is a life-threatening emergency in which a cat can produce very little to no urine.</p><h3>Frequent Trips to the Litterbox</h3><p>A cat with crystals or a stone may feel the urgent need to urinate and visit the litterbox frequently in an attempt to pass urine. It may only pass a small amount or no urine, but the pressure and discomfort of the need to urinate will not decrease.</p><h3>Vocalizing and/or Straining When Urinating</h3><p>The crystals may have formed a stone that is blocking or partially blocking the urethra making it very uncomfortable for a cat to urinate.</p><h3>Change in Color or Odor of Urine</h3><p>Crystals can irritate and inflame the bladder wall causing it to bleed. As result, your cat could pass bloody urine that may have an odor due to an additional infection.</p><h3>Excessive Grooming and Licking of Genital Area</h3><p>The pressure of crystals or a stone, and the pain of urination, may trigger a cat to excessively groom and lick its genitals in an effort to relieve the discomfort.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>If the crystals have formed a stone, it could affect and inflame the kidneys making the cat depressed and lethargic due to the pain and discomfort it's feeling.</p><h3>Decreased Appetite</h3><p>Your cat may not want to eat more because it is uncomfortable as a result of crystals.</p><h3>Chronic Urinary Infections/Cystitis</h3><p>Inflammation in the bladder from crystals can cause urinary tract infections and chronic cystitis.</p><h2>Causes of Struvite Crystals</h2><p>According to VCA Hospitals, in some cats, struvite bladder stones form as a result of a urinary tract infection, but this is less common in cats than in dogs. In most cases, however, cats develop struvite stones in the absence of an infection. In these cases, the exact cause is unknown. A number of different factors have been found to contribute to these stones, including the formation of concentrated urine, increased urine pH (alkaline urine), and increased levels of magnesium and phosphorus within the urine. </p><p>An underlying cause for the development of struvite crystals is that many cats are reluctant to drink water from bowls. They've evolved over millennia to get most of their moisture from prey. This, partnered with a diet of dry cat food, can lead to crystal development in the cat's urine.</p><h2>Diagnosing Struvite Crystals in Cats</h2><p>If you notice any of the symptoms above, it's best to contact your veterinarian immediately. At your veterinary visit, your vet will perform an exam and diagnostics to rule out the known causes of struvite crystals and stones and form a diagnosis.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Treatment for struvite stones is based on the underlying cause and is tailored to the individual cat but in most cases, treatments are dissolving the stones via a prescription diet or surgical removal. Additional treatments can include pain medications, diet changes, increasing water intake, anti-spasmodic medication to help the bladder relax, fluid therapy, and reducing stress.</p><p>Struvite stones can often be dissolved. The goal is to create more acidic and dilute urine. Canned prescription diets that acidify the urine are ideal, but dry formulations are available for cats who won't eat wet food. Medications that acidify the urine can be used when a cat must be on another type of special diet. If an infection is present, antibiotics will be necessary as well. Your veterinarian will continue to monitor your cat via rechecks (exams, radiographs, urinalysis, and/or ultrasound) until the stones are completely dissolved.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Struvite Crystals</h2><p>In some cases, struvite stones cannot be dissolved but have to be physically removed through surgery or other procedures.</p><p>If your cat has a urethral obstruction such as a bladder stone, your vet will need to relieve the obstruction quickly. To do this, they will most likely need to sedate or anesthetize your cat and will place a urinary catheter along with managing your pet's pain and other symptoms.</p><p>Cats who have developed struvite bladder stones are more likely to experience a recurrence later in life.</p><h2>How to Prevent Struvite Crystals</h2><p>You can 't always prevent struvite crystals and stones in your cat's urine. However, there are factors known to increase the chances of your cat having struvite stones which include obesity, decreased water intake, and one of the most common causes, stress. Here are ways to can reduce these factors.</p>",903

It can also make the skin more susceptible to infection. Dry skin is symptomatic of a wide range of conditions and environmental factors, so it is essential to take your cat to the vet to receive a proper diagnosis as soon as you notice dryness. Fortunately, there are many treatments for a cat's dry skin and techniques to keep it from returning once healed. Your cat's recovery has much to do with the issue causing the dryness. For example, if an autoimmune condition is causing your cat's dry skin, treatment may not be straightforward, and the dryness might not be so easily resolved.</p><h2>What Is Dry Skin?</h2><p>Dry skin is the body's response to the skin's inability to retain moisture, which creates an inflammatory response. Dry skin causes your cat to develop flaky and itchy skin, usually resulting in discomfort. Occasional, mild itchiness in any animal is normal, but dry skin and/or an underlying condition might be to blame if you notice your cat exhibiting more intense symptoms.</p><h2>Symptoms of Dry Skin in Cats</h2><p>The symptoms of dry skin in cats range in severity and overlap with symptoms of other conditions. If you're not sure that dry skin is the cause of your cat's discomfort and suspect it could be something else altogether, consult with your vet for a proper diagnosis.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Itching</h3><p>Dry, inflamed skin can be very itchy for your cat. If you notice your cat scratching excessively and maybe hurting itself, dry skin could be causing the itch. Dermatitis conditions of various levels of intensity are usually the root cause.</p><h3>Dandruff</h3><p>Dry skin in cats commonly causes dandruff. Usually, a small amount of dandruff is benign, but if you notice it in conjunction with other symptoms, a more significant problem might be behind the flakes.</p><h3>Bald Spots</h3><p>If your cat has dry skin, it may also have a few bald spots on its fur. There are a variety of conditions that cause bald spots or a patchy coat, so keep an eye out for hair abnormalities when you notice your cat scratching at its skin.</p><h3>Excessive Licking</h3><p>Cats with dry skin may excessively lick at their skin, trying to relieve some of the discomfort of the itch. Sometimes, the licking can exacerbate the skin problem, causing rawness, redness, and further pain.</p><h2>Causes of Dry Skin</h2><p>Dry skin is typically symptomatic of another issue. Whatever the issue, it can cause flaky skin, itching, and an unkempt coat appearance. You may also notice your cat self-grooming more than usual. The key to treating dry skin is first to determine its cause.</p><h2>Diagnosing Dry Skin in Cats</h2><p>If you notice dry skin in your cat, you should first contact your veterinarian for advice. Your vet may recommend an examination to evaluate the skin and administer the proper treatment. The recommended treatment will depend on the cause of your cat's skin issues. Remember to keep up with routine wellness examinations as instructed. Regular visits will allow your vet to detect the early signs of underlying illness causing dryness. Stay in communication with your vet about your cat's condition, and do your best to follow your vet's recommendations.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Your cat may need antibiotics, anti-fungals, antihistamines, anti-inflammatory drugs, special food, or supplements. Some vets recommend fatty acid supplements for cats to improve the skin. Never give your cat home remedies or supplements without first asking your vet about the best options for your cat.</p><p>There are ways to modify your cat's environment and possibly alleviate dry skin. Keep your home clean and as dust-free as possible. You should clean washable materials with gentle, additive-free detergents. Consider getting an air purifier to reduce allergens in the air. Avoid the use of harsh chemicals and fragrances in your home.</p><p>If your cat seems to have difficulty grooming, try brushing out your cat every few days. See your vet about the underlying cause of the grooming problems, as your cat may have an illness that needs treatment. If your cat is overweight, you can manage this through diet and exercise.</p><p>Avoid bathing your cat unless necessary. When cleaning your cat, use a gentle, soap-free, moisturizing shampoo.</p><p>Use an effective monthly flea control product to keep fleas at bay. Not only can fleas cause skin issues, but they can also worsen existing skin diseases.</p><p>Take steps to reduce stress in your cat's environment. Slowly introduce new pets or people to your cat, but always provide a safe place where your cat can hide. Consider using calming pheromones like Feliway spray or diffusers. Take the time to play and bond with your cat.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Dry Skin</h2><p>The success of treating cats with dry skin has much to do with the underlying cause. If, for example, your cat has chronic dry skin because of a systemic issue, the dryness may be harder to treat in the long term. The best thing you can do for your cat is to make sure they are experiencing as little pain as possible. Symptom management is achievable with environmental and grooming changes, supplements, and prescription medications.</p><h2>How to Prevent Dry Skin</h2><p>Preventing dry skin in cats isn't entirely possible, as there will always be environmental and health factors out of your control. Early in your cat's life, you can establish habits that promote healthy skin, such as frequent brushing and fatty acid supplements. Be proactive in your cat's skin health, but remember that you can only do so much to prevent the affliction altogether.</p><p>The ability to cure dry skin in cats is heavily dependent on the root cause of the dryness. However, in most cases, dry skin can be treated successfully, and you can minimize the symptoms of discomfort your cat is experiencing. Your vet will provide an appropriate treatment plan.</p><p>A couple of pieces of dandruff shouldn't be cause for worry, but if you notice your cat producing an excess of dandruff or shedding larger flakes of skin, pay a visit to the vet and diagnose what is causing dry skin.</p><p>There are many causes of dry skin in cats, so it's difficult to know exactly what is afflicting your cat. These causes include diet, stress, parasites, and weather. Take your cat to your vet as soon as possible for a diagnosis.</p>",1033
81,https://www.thesprucepets.com/renal-amyloidosis-in-cats-4692193,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Renal Amyloidosis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Renal Amyloidosis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Renal amyloidosis is a potentially deadly disease resulting from an accumulation of abnormal proteins in your cat's kidney. Because the symptoms of renal amyloidosis overlap with those of many other kidney disease, they don't always present clearly. Some of these symptoms include frequent urination, excessive thirst, and vomiting. Take your cat to the vet if you suspect any kind of kidney disease. Renal amyloidosis is most prevalent in Abyssinians and Siamese cats, and relatively rare in other breeds, but all cats are capable of developing the condition. To diagnose renal amyloidosis, your vet will perform an exhaustive exam as well as x-rays and biopsy. There is no cure for renal amyloidosis, but symptoms can be managed with medication and dietary therapy. The prognosis is poor, but certain measures can be taken to extend your cat's survival time.</p><h2>What Is Renal Amyloidosis?</h2><p>Renal amyloidosis is the accumulation of an abnormal protein, called ""amyloid,"" around kidney cells. When amyloid becomes deposited into kidney tissue, it displaces normal cells and can cause severe organ damage. Amyloid causes inflammation in the kidney that will inhibit normal function, causing a cat to pass essential proteins in its urine. With the loss of healthy proteins, a cat can lose its protection against clotting and accumulation of abdomen and limb fluid. If renal amyloidosis isn't treated, it can lead to fatal, complete organ failure.</p><h2>Symptoms of Renal Amyloidosis in Cats</h2><p>The symptoms of renal amyloidosis are the same as many other kidney diseases in cats but don't always present clearly. If you notice your cat exhibiting signs of discomfort or irregular behavior, pay a visit to your vet.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Excessive Thirst and Urination</h3><p>A cat with renal amyloidosis may empty its water bowl more quickly than usual or seek out water from other places than its bowl, such as birdbaths, drinking glasses, and the sink. Excessive urination often accompanies thirst, as the damaged kidney won't correctly concentrate and hold the urine. Your cat will drink more and urinate more as the cat cannot quench its thirst.</p><h3>Skin Tenting</h3><p>Dehydration as a result of renal amyloidosis can cause a cat's skin to ""tent,"" meaning if the skin is picked up around the neck and gently pulled away from the body, it will form a ""tent"" instead of falling back to its normal position.</p><h3>Vomiting and Weight Loss</h3><p>Weight loss can occur in cats with renal amyloidosis either because of vomiting or decreased appetite. The buildup of waste products that a healthy kidney would be able to filter can cause a cat to feel very ill, stop eating, and start vomiting.</p><h3>Swollen Limbs</h3><p>Renal amyloidosis sometimes causes a cat's limbs to swell. When amyloid causes healthy protein levels in the blood to drop too low, fluid build-up in the legs and lymphatic system can occur.</p><h3>Oral Sores</h3><p>Diseased kidneys cause a build-up of nitrogen compounds in the blood, leading to mouth ulcers. The symptoms of mouth ulcers include oral bleeding, excessive salivation, and decreased appetite due to oral pain.</p><h2>Causes of Renal Amyloidosis</h2><p>Several factors may lead to renal amyloidosis in cats. The abnormal protein structure is believed to result from a gene mutation, a hereditary disorder present in the bloodline of feline family trees.</p><h2>Diagnosing Renal Amyloidosis in Cats</h2><p>It is difficult to distinguish renal amyloidosis in cats from other renal disease, and the symptoms of renal amyloidosis are shared by many other feline organ diseases. A diagnosis is made more complicated by the fact that renal amyloidosis is relatively rare in cats. If your vet notices that your cat's kidney is the most impacted of all of the affected organs, your vet may consider amyloidosis a cause and proceed with tests. A vet touching the kidneys or observing them on an x-ray will likely not be enough to make a diagnosis. The only way an accurate diagnosis can be given is with a kidney biopsy. The biopsy will reveal the presence of amyloid, which is unfortunately sometimes performed postmortem.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>There is no cure for renal amyloidosis in cats. Managing the symptoms of the disease may prolong the quality of a cat's life and slow the disease progression, but there is no treatment to reverse or stop amyloid protein build-up. Treatment of uncomfortable symptoms may include fluid administration, dietary changes, anti-inflammatory medications, and medication to treat secondary problems such as hypertension.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Renal Amyloidosis</h2><p>The prognosis for cats with renal amyloidosis is poor. Most cats with affected or failing kidneys will survive less than one year. Other, less affected cats may be able to extend their lives using medication and dietary therapy to achieve a closer-to-normal life expectancy. This is only true if your cat has not yet experienced any kidney failure.</p><h2>How to Prevent Renal Amyloidosis</h2><p>The primary way to prevent renal amyloidosis is by closely monitoring your cat's health. Vets should regularly examine Abyssinian and Siamese cat breeds to develop renal amyloidosis. Even though it isn't known what causes this disease, if signs of renal amyloidosis are discovered early, the progression may be able to be slowed. Annual blood screening for young cats and twice-yearly screenings for older cats is recommended to monitor kidney health.</p><p>Renal amyloidosis is generally not common in cats, but if you have an Abyssinian or Siamese cat, the disease is much more likely to develop. Monitor any cat for signs of illness, but keep a closer eye on those two breeds.</p><p>Unfortunately, renal amyloidosis is not curable. A vet can take specific measures to improve your cat's quality of life, but a cat isn't expected to survive long after a diagnosis.</p><p>Renal amyloidosis can cause excessive urination in cats because the impaired kidney cannot correctly concentrate nutrients. This means that every time your cat pees, it expels essential proteins and vitamins that its body doesn't know how to hold onto through a regular urination pattern. See a vet immediately if this happens.</p>",963
82,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hip-dysplasia-in-cats-4774776,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Hip Dysplasia in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Hip Dysplasia in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Hip dysplasia is an orthopedic condition of the hip joint that, though uncommon, can affect cats. It results from abnormal development of one or both hip joints and causes instability and degeneration of the joints. Cats don't always exhibit clear signs of hip dysplasia, but symptoms such as limping, avoiding exercise, and irritability may point to a diagnosis. Hip dysplasia in cats is mainly hereditary but can sometimes be caused by obesity. Large purebred cats such as Maine coon and Himalayan cats are more likely to develop hip dysplasia than mixed breed cats. Treatment typically involves medications to manage pain and inflammation. If detected and treated early, you can expect a full recovery.</p><h2>What Is Hip Dysplasia?</h2><p>Hip dysplasia is a degenerative disease that causes a malformation of the ball-and-socket joint in the hip, leading to pain and stiffness. Cats with hip dysplasia will likely develop osteoarthritis if the disease progresses.</p><p>A normal, functioning hip joint consists of a rounded femoral head that sits in a socket-like structure called the acetabulum. The joint can operate smoothly with the assistance of cartilage, joint fluid, and muscles. But when a cat has hip dysplasia, the femoral head develops an irregular shape and does not sit properly within the socket. The joint becomes unstable, causing pain, inflammation, and stiffness. The poorly-fitting joint may eventually erode the cartilage, causing the bones to rub together.</p><h2>Symptoms of Hip Dysplasia in Cats</h2><p>It is common for cats to show no signs of illness in the early stages of hip dysplasia, and cats with mild to moderate disease may never exhibit symptoms. Your vet may discover signs of hip dysplasia during a routine wellness exam or when taking x-rays for an unrelated reason.</p><p>The signs of hip dysplasia may be similar to other injuries. If you see these or any other signs of illness in your cat, contact your vet for an appointment.</p> <h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Lameness or Limping</h3><p>The pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by your cat's unstable joint may lead to lameness or limping. If untreated, this will likely get worse over time. If you notice changes in your cat's mobility, consult a vet.</p><h3>Exercise Intolerance</h3><p>In addition to lameness and limping, hip dysplasia can affect your cat's ability to exercise, impacting movements like jumping, running, and climbing.</p><h3>Lethargy/Irritability</h3><p>If your cat has hip dysplasia, it might be experiencing lethargy and irritability due to the pain of the condition. If you notice a change in your cat's mood, consider physical discomfort a potential cause.</p><h3>Stiffness</h3><p>Your cat's poorly-fitting joint may lead to stiffness. The stiffness may be especially noticeable when your cat gets up or lies down.</p><h3>Muscle Loss</h3><p>Muscle loss in your cat's hips or thighs may be symptomatic of hip dysplasia. Conversely, enlarged shoulder muscles can also be a sign of hip dysplasia, as your cat is relying more on the top half of its body to avoid painful use of the hips and compensate for the muscle loss.</p><h2>Causes of Hip Dysplasia</h2><p>Hip dysplasia is believed to be a hereditary disease in cats, but a couple of factors can be linked to the development of the condition.</p><h2>Diagnosing Hip Dysplasia in Cats</h2><p>If you suspect your cat has hip dysplasia, it's best to visit your vet to confirm the issue. After observing symptoms of hip dysplasia in your cat, your vet can give a formal diagnosis following an x-ray of the affected joint.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Your vet will diagnose your cat's hip dysplasia through a physical examination and x-rays. Treatment considerations are made based on the severity of the x-ray results and your cat's symptoms.</p><p>Hip dysplasia in cats is typically first treated conservatively. This treatment generally includes medications to manage pain and inflammation and possible changes in activity levels. If the conservative approach is not enough, your vet will talk to you about surgical treatment for your cat.</p><p>The most common surgery is called a femoral head and neck excision. During this surgery, the vet removes the deformed head and neck of the femur. In time, your cat's muscles rebuild and form a new, false joint. After recovery, most cats will live a happy, normal life.</p><p>In rare cases, your vet may consider a total hip replacement. This surgery involves the replacement of the hip joint with a special synthetic hip called a micro-THR.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Hip Dysplasia</h2><p>If detected early and treated swiftly, you can limit the residual effects of hip dysplasia in your cat. As the impact of the condition progresses, symptoms will appear gradually and continue to worsen over time if unnoticed or untreated. For example, osteoarthritis typically occurs secondary to hip dysplasia, making the pain, inflammation, and stiffness worse. Severe hip dysplasia often requires surgery, but usually, treatment will fully rehabilitate your cat. If surgery isn't suitable for your cat, your vet may prescribe anti-inflammatory medication or physical therapies.</p><h2>How to Prevent Hip Dysplasia</h2><p>Because it is hereditary, hip dysplasia in cats cannot be completely prevented. But you may be able to catch the condition early and slow its progression. If your cat is not genetically predisposed to hip dysplasia, the best preventative measure is to make sure that your cat is a healthy weight and exercises its muscles frequently. Contact your vet when you first notice ongoing lameness, pain, or stiffness.</p><p>Future cases of hip dysplasia can be prevented by cat breeders in that a cat with hip dysplasia can be spayed or neutered to discontinue the genetic passage of the condition. Cats with hip dysplasia should not be used for breeding.</p>",900
83,https://www.thesprucepets.com/color-blindness-in-cats-5248467,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Color Blindness in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Color Blindness in Cats</h1><p>Walk down any cat toy or cat bed aisle in any pet supply store and you will see that cat toys and beds come in all sorts of colors. Not only that, cat toys, bedding, and blankets can come in a variety of hues and shades, ranging from pastels to neons. This begs the question: Can cats see colors? Or are cats color blind?</p><h2>What Is Color Blindness in Cats?</h2><p>Color blindness is the lack of ability to discern certain colors from one another. It doesn 't mean you don 't see any color at all. In people, red green color blindness is most common, effecting about 8% of men and 0.5% of women. Yellow blue color blindness is another type of color blindness in people and there 's a third, more rare type of color blindness called monochromaticsm, which means the person can only see black and white.</p><p>In cats, color blindness is harder to understand, namely because they can 't undergo a color blind test that people can take. In the eye are two types of specialized cells. One type, termed rods, aid in light vision. The other type, termed cones, aid in color vision. People are known to have trichromatic vision, meaning they have three types of cones: one sensitive to red, one sensitive to blue, and one sensitive to green. Having these three types of cones allow us to see all the colors of the rainbow.</p><p>Cats were traditionally thought to have two types of cones in their eyes, giving them dichromatic vision. One is sensitive to shades of blue-violet while the other is sensitive to shades of yellow-green. This leaves blue-greens, and reds as colors that cats might not be able to discern as easily as you or I could. Dichromatism in cats is thought to be most analogous to red green color blindness in people where shades of blue-greens and reds appear more like gray.</p><p>There have been studies to determine if cats are actually trichromatic since 3 different types of cones have been observed in cats. One study showed that this third type of cone may be sensitive to shades of cyan (a fancy way of describing blue-greens). Furthermore, another study showed that cats might actually have something called photopic trichromatic vision. This basically means that cats may see a similar color spectrum to humans in daylight, but maybe not quite as vibrantly. So their world may appear more pastel-like than day-glo. There 's even studies into whether or not cats can see ultraviolet light! Since urine trails can be seen by animals with UV vision, this may be a reason cats house soil in the same spot over and over again.</p><p>Cats, like us, have front-facing eyes, giving them a larger portion of binocular vision as opposed to uniocular vision. Binocular vision is what allows for depth perception, which is an important adaptation for being able to catch prey.</p><h2>Effects of Color Blindness on Cats</h2><p>Since we don 't fully understand what kind of vision cats actually have - dichromatic versus photopic trichromatic - it 's hard to discern the extent of their color vision and what limitations may exist. While some purport that cats don 't react to toys if they are a color they can't see, such as red or yellow, not being able to discern a specific color is far different than not being able to see at all. A red toy may not appear red to your cat but they will still be able to see it and they may still play with it.</p><h2>Variation in Color Blindness in Cats</h2><p>Whether cats have dichromatic vision or photopic trichromatic, they likely don 't see the visible light spectrum the same way that we do. The inability to discern these certain colors, however, is normal for cats. That being said, it is possible that some cats may have an even more limited color vision. Red green color blindness, yellow blue color blindness, and monochromatism are all inheritable traits in humans. Cats may have a similar, inheritable trait that further limits their color vision but this has not been documented at this time.</p><h2>Testing Color Vision in Cats</h2><p>As previously mentioned, cats can 't take color blindness tests like people. That being said, cats certainly can have favorite toys and favorite beds and this may lead owners to suspect their preference is based on what colors they can (or cannot) see. However, they could love that toy or blanket for any number of reasons. There is no straightforward way to test a cat's color vision at this time, and that is a large part of why there still remain so many unknowns about what they actually see when it comes to colors. </p><h2>Treatment For Color Blindness in Cats</h2><p>Because color blindness in cats is normal for them, there 's no need for concern and nothing to treat. Any cat owner will tell you that their cat is not impeded by its limited color vision. In fact, cats have so many other special vision features that they often see things we don't.</p><h2>Color Considerations for Cats</h2><p>Cats may not see the visible light spectrum like humans, but for most cats, that certainly doesn 't impede their vision whatsoever. Most cats live a happy, healthy life, regardless of their ability, or inability, to see specific colors.</p><p>Are cats really color blind? Compared to the color spectrum we can see, yes. But that doesn 't mean they can 't see any colors at all. Should you only offer them toys and beds in the colors they can see? You might gravitate towards a specific cat toy in the store because of the color scheme it has, and even if your cat doesn 't see the toy's colors as you do, they can still enjoy their new toy just the same</p>",963
84,https://www.thesprucepets.com/intervertebral-disc-disease-in-cats-5101725,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Intervertebral Disc Disease (IVDD) in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Intervertebral disk disease (IVDD) is a condition where the cushions between the cat's spinal bones harden, swell, or rupture. IVDD may be otherwise known as a slipped, herniated, or ruptured disc. The result is that the spinal cord and its surrounding nerves become damaged or compressed and may lead to a cat's inability to walk or move its limbs. Though IVDD is more prevalent in dogs, it is rare, but not impossible, for a cat to have the condition with similar results and outcomes.</p><h2>What is Intervertebral Disc Disease?</h2><p>Intervertebral disc disease affects your cat's intervertebral discs. Your cat's spinal column is comprised of alternating vertebrae and discs. The vertebrae are the individual bones and the discs are essentially shock absorbers that cushion each vertebra. These discs are made of a firm, outer layer while the interior is more jelly-like in its consistency.</p><p>IVDD occurs when this jelly-like interior gets pushed out (or herniates) into the spinal cord, which houses a multitude of nerves. When a disc herniates, the nerves may get pinched affecting how your cat functions and moves. This can lead to something as minor as neck or back pain and as major as partial or total paralysis. If a cat's rear limbs are affected, this is called thoracolumbar (T-L) disc disease, which is part of the IVDD condition. IVDD is common in dogs, especially breeds with shorter legs, but the incidence of it happening in cats is rare, although possible.</p><h2>What are the Symptoms of IVDD in Cats?</h2><p>Your cat's symptoms will depend on where the herniated disc is located in its spine. The severity also depends on how badly the nerves are being pinched. A cat in pain may hide or mask its symptoms so it may be a challenge to identify if your pet is ill. However if you notice any of the following symptoms, however non-specific they may seem to IVDD, call your vet.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Neck and Back Pain or Weakness</h3><p>If your cat is hanging its head low or its front limbs seem to be in pain or weak, this behavior could indicate a neck problem. If you notice your cat may be in pain or weak in its back limbs, this could indicate a back problem.</p><h3>Hunched Back</h3><p>If your cat has back pain, you may find it awkwardly arching or hunching its back as it is standing up or laying down.</p><h3>Reduced Grooming</h3><p>Your cat may have stopped grooming itself like it used to. If your cat has back pain, contorting itself into a tight ball to reach certain areas so it can clean can be uncomfortable. If your cat does stop grooming themselves, you may start to notice that their coat is greasy, matted, and they may have dandruff.</p><h3>Uncoordinated Gait and Decreased Mobility</h3><p>Spinal pain will make it difficult for your cat to walk or move with ease. It may also be unwilling or have the ability to jump due to the pain.</p><h3>Loss of Bladder or Bowel Control</h3><p>The compression of the spinal cord may lead to incontinence as certain nerves are impacted. As in dogs, a cat's IVDD injury, depending on where the spinal compression is located, can result in urinary and fecal incontinence or retention.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite</h3><p>Though it's a subtle symptom, you might notice that your cat has stopped eating. Extreme pain can lead to inappetence in an animal. Leaning its head down to eat out of a bowl on the floor is painful because it can put a lot of stress on the cat's neck.</p><h2>Causes of Intervertebral Disc Disease</h2><p>In a few cases, discs may calcify or become more fibrous over time. When this happens, the integrity of the discs diminish and they are more at risk of herniating.</p><p>More commonly, trauma from an impact (like falling from a high distance or being struck by a vehicle) can rupture the disc, allowing the inner portion to herniate out. The most common places for a herniated disc in your cat would be in its neck and the middle of the back.</p><h2>Diagnosing IVDD in Cats</h2><p>When you bring your cat to the vet for suspected IVDD, many tests may be performed.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If your cat is diagnosed with IVDD, your vet will create a treatment plan based on the severity of the case.</p><p>If your cat's case is more severe, surgery may be required to correct the herniated disc. This is a highly specialized procedure and would require a veterinary specialist to perform it.</p><h2>Prognosis of Cats With IVDD</h2><p>Regardless of the severity of the problem, if treatment is sought out and your cat's spinal cord is not severely damaged (that is if your cat still has a deep pain response), a full recovery is usually possible. There is also research regarding the potential benefits of intensive physical rehabilitation techniques for cats that have suffered from thoracolumbar spinal cord injury, a type of IVDD.</p><h2>How to Prevent IVDD</h2><p>There is no way to prevent a cat from having IVDD. You can only try your best to prevent your cat from falling out of windows with loose or no screens or jumping off high places, such as balconies without gates, so it does not hit the ground hard and become seriously injured. These types of incidents could make your pet prone to IVDD.</p>",867
85,https://www.thesprucepets.com/coccidia-in-cats-5070430,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Coccidia in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Coccidia in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Coccidia may not be visible to the naked eye but that doesn't mean it can't cause problems in your cat. This microscopic parasite infects the intestinal tract of cats and other species and causes coccidiosis, a condition of the intestinal mucosa. It can exist undetected in your cat so it's important to know how to see if your cat is infected and how to treat it.</p><h2>What Is Coccidia?</h2><p>Coccidia is a type of single-celled organism that is an intestinal parasite, but it is not a worm or an egg. There are many different species of coccidia but two species of coccidia are most common in cats: and . These parasites live in the cells of the intestines. It's inevitable that a cat will become infected with the species at least one time in its life.</p><p>and are also species of coccidia but the species are the ones that are most typically referred to as coccidia. and are much less common than regular coccidia in cats.</p><h2>Symptoms of Coccidia in Cats</h2><p>Like other intestinal parasites, coccidia commonly affects the stool of an infected cat. However, many cats that are infected with coccidia do not have diarrhea or any other clinical signs. If there are going to be signs of the illness, the symptoms will begin to show up about 13 days after the cat ingests the parasites.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Diarrhea</h3><p>Most cats that are showing symptoms of a coccidia infection will have watery diarrhea. Sometimes blood will appear in diarrhea. This is an obvious symptom but many different problems and diseases can cause abnormal stools. It may also be difficult to spot diarrhea if your cat regularly covers its stool in the litter box. Look for signs of discolored fur around your cat's back end that may harbor remnants of liquid fecal matter.</p><h3>Crying When Defecating</h3><p>If a coccidia infection worsens, a cat may have abdominal discomfort and cry when defecating. Persistent diarrhea may have caused inflammation in the rectal and anal areas.</p><h3>Sensitive Belly</h3><p>A cat with coccidia has parasites in its intestinal tract which will cause pain in the abdomen. Your cat may then become distressed when its belly is pressed.</p><h3>Dehydration and Sunken Eyes</h3><p>If diarrhea is left untreated, dehydration can occur resulting in sunken eyes and skin tenting.</p><h3>Skin Tenting</h3><p>Dehydration causes skin tenting, which is most obvious when it's observed over the shoulder blades. To tell if your cat has skin tenting, lift your cat's skin between the shoulder blades. If the skin forms a tent-like shape and stays that way for a second or more instead of immediately snapping back onto the body, the cat may be dehydrated.</p><h3>Vomiting</h3><p>With severe infections, coccidia can also cause vomiting, which can make dehydration worse.</p><h3>Lethargy/Loss of Appetite</h3><p>In infections, cats may show a lack of appetite and become lethargic due to intestinal distress, but like cats with infections of other types of coccidia, most show no symptoms at all.</p><h2>Causes of Coccidia</h2><p>For a cat to become infected with coccidia, it needs to consume the parasite. This is most commonly done when a cat ingests an infected mouse or another cat's feces. When a cat swallows the oocyst, which is the immature, infectious form of coccidia, the cat develops coccidiosis. A mother cat with coccidia can also transmit it to her kittens. A newborn kitten will begin to show symptoms when it's two weeks old.</p><h2>Diagnosing Coccidia in Cats</h2><p>If your cat is showing any signs of coccidiosis, your veterinarian will check your cat's feces under the microscope to look for coccidia oocysts (cysts containing the parasite). This parasite is very tiny compared to other intestinal parasites and can be easily missed so a very thorough fecal analysis, or multiple fecal analyses, must be performed to find it.</p><p>If your veterinarian is concerned that your cat may have one of the less common types of coccidia such as or , they may need to run additional specific tests. A series of blood or fecal samples are often taken in those cases.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>To treat coccidiosis in a cat showing symptoms, your cat will need a specific type of anti-parasitic medication to kill the parasite. Usually, a drug called trimethoprim-sulfonamide is prescribed and given orally to your cat for about a week or up to 20 days to treat the infection. Even with treatment with certain medicines, there is the potential for persistent low-level traces of the infection until it is completely eradicated. Probiotics, prebiotics, and special diets may also be needed.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Coccidia</h2><p>The outcome is good for cats appropriately treated with coccidia. Most cats with strong immune systems seem to spontaneously get rid of the parasite on their own by shedding it in their stool. While coccidia is a very common parasite in cats, many do not require treatment if they aren't showing symptoms. On the other side of the spectrum, a severe coccidia infection may be fatal to kittens and adult cats with other health issues.</p><h2>How to Prevent Coccidia</h2><p>You can prevent your cat from contracting coccidia by taking preventative measures.</p><h2>Is Coccidia Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>The common types of coccidia are not a concern for humans but if your cat is diagnosed with or you can potentially become infected. Immune compromised individuals have the highest risk of infection but by practicing good hygiene techniques and properly disposing of cat feces you can minimize the risk of contracting these zoonotic diseases.</p>",882
86,https://www.thesprucepets.com/understanding-rabies-in-cats-4801628,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Rabies in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Rabies in Cats</h1><h2>Why getting your feline the vaccine is important</h2><p>As a pet owner, you know that your pet is vulnerable to rabies. However, do you understand all the aspects of the rabies disease for your cat? Are you aware of how rabies can affect your other pets and family members? It is important to understand why your cat needs a rabies vaccine.</p><h2>What Is Rabies?</h2><p>Rabies is a virus that negatively affects a mammal 's central nervous system. It is almost always fatal and death typically occurs within a week after symptoms occur. The disease is transmitted by bites from infected animals. It is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread to people via animals. If bitten by an animal with rabies, humans are susceptible to the virus, just as animals are. Most cases involve non-domesticated animals such as skunks, raccoons, and bats. Domestic pets like cats and dogs can also be infected.</p><h2>Symptoms of Rabies</h2><p>There are various symptoms of rabies and all symptoms may not be present in every infected animal. The first signs you may see could be changes in your cat 's behavior; it may become withdrawn, anxious, shy, or fearful. Your pet may also lick the wound from the bite. These first symptoms could then lead to more behavior changes such as restlessness, agitation, difficulty walking, and atypical reactions to noises and sights. The foaming at the mouthsymptom that is typically associated with the rabies disease happens from paralysis of the muscles responsible for swallowing and vocalizing. This prevents the cat from swallowing so there is excess foamysaliva.</p><h2>Rabies Transmission</h2><p>When an animal or person is bitten by an infected animal, the saliva transmits the disease through the nerves and spine and into the brain. There is an incubation period of anywhere from 3 to 24 weeks while no symptoms are present. Once the brain gets infected, the rabies virus duplicates to the salivary glands and the symptoms will start to show. In rare cases, the virus can be passed through eyes, nose, or mouth contact. Biting is the most common way the disease is transmitted.</p><h2>Diagnosing Rabies</h2><p>To determine the level of concern for rabies virus in cats, veterinarians will look for signs of the symptoms and review patient history. However, a definitive diagnosis can only be confirmed after the animal 's death with a brain tissue sample and a direct fluorescent antibody test (dFA). Humans can be diagnosed by testing saliva, hair, skin, and blood samples but these are not certain nor does this type of testing work for animals. If your cat has been exposed to rabies virus, it will need to be quarantined so that symptoms, if they develop, can be recognized. This is especially true for unvaccinated pets. Any cat that develops symptoms will be euthanized.</p><h2>Rabies Treatment</h2><p>Rabies has no cure and there is no treatment to remedy the virus. When animals show the advanced signs of rabies, euthanasia is the only option. Since death is almost always the result of this disease, euthanasia prevents your pet from suffering and prevents the disease from transmitting to other animals and humans.</p><p>When a human is exposed to rabies, they must begin a treatment called post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This treatment involves a series of injections of rabies vaccine and immune globulin. PEP will not work after a human shows signs of being infected. Even in humans, when symptoms appear, this disease is almost always fatal. At this stage, supportive care will be necessary for the comfort of the patient.</p><h2>Preventing Rabies</h2><p>Rabies prevention is simple and the best way to guard against contracting the virus. Your cat should receive routine rabies vaccines. The frequency of this routine varies between one and three years. Your veterinarian can explain what is legally required for vaccination of rabies and help you make the best choice for your pet.</p><p>There is also a vaccine for humans, but the guidelines and processes are different than for animals. People who work with wildlife or pets and those who travel to areas that have a high risk of exposure to rabies can be given the vaccine. However, even those who have received the vaccine will have to complete PEP if exposed.</p><p>After vaccination, keeping your pet from being exposed to rabies will help prevent the possibility of infection. Keep your cat in your sight when it is outdoors and do not let them roam areas that wildlife inhabit. Do not allow your cat around animals you are not familiar with and if your pet does get an animal bite, take him to your vet immediately.</p><p>Prevention of rabies for humans is also important. Teach children to be cautious around animals. When a human is bitten by an animal, they should see their doctor right away.</p><p>When an animal or human is bitten by an animal, get as much information about the animal as you can. You should get owner contact information, pet vaccination history, and any rabies exposure that the pet may have had. If the bite was from a wild animal there may not be much information you can capture, but it is essential to notify the local authorities.</p><p>Rabies is easily preventable even though it is a dangerous and deadly virus. The two most important things to remember are to ensure your pet gets routine rabies vaccinations and always keep exposure to a minimum. Understanding what rabies is, the signs, expected progression and outcome, and how to prevent rabies will keep you and your entire family--pets and people--safe.</p>",907

Thiszoonotic disease can spread to people and other animals, typically via bites from those already infected. Rabies is most common in wildlife like raccoons, skunks, and bats, but it can also infect domesticated cats and dogs as well as any other warm-blooded animal.</p><p>The number of cases of cats with rabies actually exceeds those in dogs. This is perhaps because cats are more often allowed to roam free outside and may come into contact with Rabid wildlife or stray animals, especially at night. Also, many cats are not routinely vaccinated against rabies.</p><p>After a cat has been exposed to rabies, it can take weeks to months for signs to appear. Once signs of rabies appear in a cat, death usually occurs within 10 days. There is no treatment for rabies in animals. This is why the rabbies vaccination is absolutely essential for all cats.</p><p>The signs of rabies in cats are typically divided into three categories: prodromal, excitative/furious, and paralytic.</p><h2>Bite Wound</h2><p>Before signs of rabies appear, you may notice a bite wound or abscess on your cat. This might have come from wildlife, another cat, or even a dog, any of which may carry rabies. Additionally, if you know your cat was in close proximity to wildlife, such as a bat, skunk, or raccoon, even if you don't see an obvious bite wound, you should contact your veterinarian.</p><p>Any bite wound or other injury should be treated by a veterinarian as soon as possible. Discuss your cat's rabies vaccination history with your vet so you can understand the risk of them contracting this disease.</p><p>If the cat has previously been vaccinated against rabies, your vet may recommend re-vaccination after the bite, especially if the vaccine is overdue. This can boost immunity and prevent rabies from advancing to the nervous system and becoming fatal.</p><p>If the cat has never been vaccinated for rabies, then there is no treatment available. These animals typically need to be quarantined and observed for signs of rabies. Sadly, humane euthanasia is the only option once signs of rabies begin for any animal, whether they have been vaccinated or not.</p><p>The typical incubation period for rabies in cats is one to three months after exposure, but it may be longer in some cases. During this time, the virus travels through the body to the nervous system, eventually reaching the brain. The signs of rabies infection appear after this incubation period. Once signs of rabies appear, death typically occurs within 10 days.</p><p>Note that cats may be able to spread rabies several days before signs appear.</p><h2>Prodromal Stage</h2><p>This is when the first signs of rabies affect a cat's behavior. You may notice that your outgoing cat is suddenly shy and hiding. Fearful cats might even become more confident. The cat may become lethargic, have decreased appetite, or fever.</p><p>Behavior and personality changes vary by case; some cats will exhibit very noticeable personality changes at this stage while other cats will only show mild changes at first, making it difficult to identify the problem.</p><p>The prodromal stage of rabies usually lasts two to three days.</p><h2>Excitative (Furious) Stage</h2><p>During this stage, cats tend to show more extreme behavior changes. They appear agitated and restless and often overreact to normal sights and sounds. Many cats will become aggressive for no apparent reason. They may attack people, other animals, and even objects without provocation. They may also show signs of incoordination, loss of balance, hypersensitivity to touch, or seizures.</p><p>This stage can last one to seven days and may somewhat overlap the other stages or may be completely absent in some infections.</p><h2>Paralytic Stage</h2><p>During the final stage of rabies, the cat develops weakness and eventually paralysis in the head, neck, and chest. The larynx will become paralyzed and the cat will no longer be able to vocalize or swallow. This is when the well-known sign of ""foaming at the mouth"" begins; if the cat is unable to swallow, salivation becomes excessive.</p><p>As weakness turns to paralysis, the muscles that control breathing can no longer function, leading to death.</p><p>The paralytic stage of rabies lasts two to four days and ultimately leads to death.</p><p>It's important to understand that each case of rabies is unique and the cat's signs may not match the typical signs described above.</p><p>Cats with possible exposure to rabies will need to be quarantined to protect people and other animals from exposure. Sick animals with suspected Rabies will need to be euthanized.</p><p>If any cat has bitten a person, that cat will need to be quarantined for ten days. This is because we know that a cat that is contagious will have signs of rabies within 10 days. If the cat does not show any symptoms during the quarantine and remains healthy, then the cat was not contagious at the time of the bite and would not have transmitted rabies to that person.</p><p>The only way to definitively diagnose rabies is through analysis of the brain tissue after death. The brain must be sent to a pathologist for testing.</p><p>Cats with rabies may have a change in behavior and turn aggressive, irritable, and angry towards other animals and humans. A cat with rabies may also have neurological signs including loss of balance, seizures, or disorientation. They may also drool or foam at the mouth.</p><p>Cats with rabies will die within 10 days of symptoms developing, however, the incubation period after a bite can be months.</p><p>Rabies is spread through saliva, and it can take a cat anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months to become contagious after being infected. Usually they become contagious one to five days before neurological symptoms develop.</p>",940
88,https://www.thesprucepets.com/heatstroke-in-cats-551995,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Heatstroke in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Heatstroke in Cats</h1><p>Just like humans and dogs, cats can be affected by high temperatures. Heatstroke and heat exhaustion are serious conditions that can occur in any animal. We tend to hear more about Heatstroke in dogs, especially those left in hot cars or taken outside as temperatures increase. Cats are not commonly affected by Heatstroke because they are less likely to be trapped in hot areas, but this doesn't mean they are not at risk. You can protect your cat by understanding the signs of heatstroke and learning what actions to take.</p><h2>What Is Heatstroke?</h2><p>Heatstroke is a condition that occurs when the body temperature has become dangerously high. A cat's normal body temperature range is between 99.5 and 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit. An internal body temperature over 102.5 is considered abnormal. If the elevation in body temperature is caused by a hot environment, heat exhaustion may develop and heatstroke is likely to follow.</p><p>Heat exhaustion is a precursor to heatstroke. The cat's body temperature becomes too high for the body to cool itself, and heatstroke will soon develop if the cat is not removed from the hot area. Heatstroke can begin when a cat's internal body temperature goes over about 104 degrees. This causes damage to the organs and cells in the body that may quickly result in death.</p><h2>Signs of Heatstroke in Cats</h2><p>Cats are experts at hiding signs of illness, so you may not notice your cat is overheated until things have become serious.</p><h2>Causes of Heatstroke</h2><p>Cats are unable to regulate their body temperature as well as people can. The human body is able to sweat and cool down in response to hot environments. Dogs can pant to cool down up to a point, though this process is not as effective at cooling them down in the heat. Cats do not sweat to cool down and they don't normally pant until they are already in distress. To stay cool, cats tend to move to cooler areas like tile floors, sinks, or tubs. Self-grooming can imitate sweating and provide some cooling. A cat's coat provides some protection against the heat, but this only works to some extent. If a cat ends up in a dangerously hot situation, the body cannot cool down fast enough to prevent overheating.</p><p>Most cats instinctively move to cooler locations as soon as they feel too warm. Most are able to cool themselves before they approach heat exhaustion. However, a cat may become trapped in a hot area like a greenhouse, garage, shed, car, outdoors or even a clothes dryer. These are unfortunately some of the more common causes of heatstroke in cats.</p><p>Kittens, seniors, and sick cats are more susceptible to heatstroke because they are even less capable of regulating their temperatures than healthy adult cats. In addition, short-nosed cats like Persians often have compromised airways and are more sensitive to heat. Overweight and obese cats are also more prone to overheating. It's important that high-risk cats remain in temperature-regulated indoor areas.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The best thing to do if you suspect heatstroke is to get your cat to the nearest open veterinary facility right away. Call the hospital or clinic when you are on the way to get advice about safe cooling methods.</p><p>You may be able to check your cat's body temperature to assess the severity of the situation. If their body temperature is over 104 degrees, you may be able to administer cooling methods at home. Keep in mind that your cat will still need to see a veterinarian.</p><p>Cooling down an overheated cat must be done with care. It may seem natural to use ice or very cold water, but these may constrict the blood vessels and actually prevent cooling. Ice and cold water may also over-cool the cat and lead to hypothermia, another dangerous condition.</p><p>Bring your cat to the vet as soon as possible for an examination, even if your cat seems to be back to normal. Your vet may need to run lab tests to check for damage to the internal organs and cells in the body. Additional treatment may be needed to rehydrate your cat, regulate body temperature, and attempt to reverse internal damage. Sadly, not all cats will recover from heatstroke.</p><h2>How to Prevent Heatstroke</h2><p>Be sure not to accidentally trap your cat in an area that gets hot. Never leave your cat in a hot car or other hot, enclosed area. The heat inside can rise far higher than the outside temperature.</p><p>Do not shave your cat's fur to keep them cool. A cat's coat has the ability to keep them both warm and cool. Additionally, shaving the coat increases the risk of sunburn.</p><p>If you have a cat that goes outdoors, provide access to cool indoor areas and fresh water at all times. Make sure you see the cat at least twice a day. If you have not seen your cat in a while, check to make sure they are not trapped somewhere.</p><p>Indoor cats should also have access to fresh water and cool areas. Make sure to leave the air conditioner or fan on when you are not home. Before running the dryer, always check to make sure your cat has not snuck inside. Sadly, this is not an uncommon occurrence.</p>",860
89,https://www.thesprucepets.com/treating-gingivitis-in-cats-4772190,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Gingivitis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Gingivitis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Gingivitis, an inflammatory disease of the gums, is common in cats. Most cats over three years old have some degree of gingivitis and associated dental disease due to dietary influences, diseases, or physical abnormalities. Short-nosed breeds like Persians are more susceptible to gingivitis due to oral malalignment. Gum inflammation can cause severe discomfort and, if untreated, can lead to tooth loss, bone infection, and bacteria entering the bloodstream through diseased oral tissues. A systemic bacterial infection can damage other organs in a cat's body. Both preventative and acute treatment measures can help reduce the risks associated with gingivitis and support your cat's overall health as well.</p><h2>What Is Gingivitis?</h2><p>Gingivitis refers to inflammation of the gingiva, which is the gum surrounding the tooth. Gingivitis can be mild to severe. Mild gingivitis is very common in cats of all breeds and ages and is considered the earliest stage of periodontal disease. Over time, plaque accumulates on the teeth, and the gums become more inflamed. Gum recession may begin at this stage. If left untreated, gingivitis will worsen and become severe. In severe cases, cats can have difficulty eating due to the pain, and a dental cleaning under anesthesia will be required to prevent further discomfort and damage.</p><h2>Symptoms of Gingivitis</h2><p>The symptoms of gingivitis are mostly associated with a cat's mouth. In more severe cases, signs of illness may be observed in the cat's physical and behavioral conditions.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The first signs of gingivitis in cats will be bad breath and gum inflammation, which means the gums will appear red or swollen. Drooling is a possible indication of oral discomfort but can be caused by other conditions, so it is not a definitive symptom of gingivitis by itself.</p><p>A cat with sore gums or an associated tooth infection will either refuse food or show difficulty in chewing. It may spit food out or appear to chew on only one side of its mouth. Of course, if a cat stops eating, it will lose weight and suffer nutritionally. Weight loss, as well as behavioral changes, can be associated with other health conditions and should be evaluated by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Causes of Gingivitis</h2><p>The most common cause of gingivitis in cats is a build-up of plaque and bacteria.</p> <h2>Diagnosing Gingivitis in Cats</h2><p>As a cat owner, you will probably be the first to notice problems with your cat's oral health. If you notice any of the possible symptoms of gingivitis, make an appointment with your veterinarian. A simple oral exam will reveal the presence of gingivitis to your doctor's trained eye. If there is only minor redness or inflammation, no further diagnostic testing may be required. However, if your vet suspects an infection or deeper damage within the oral cavity, then x-rays may be needed to assess the extent of the disease.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Treatment of gingivitis involves removing accumulated plaque and dental calculus, then extracting loose or infected teeth to prevent further disease progression. Regular dental care and medical management are typically the first lines of treatment. A routine dental cleaning and dental x-rays should be performed under anesthesia to address any inflammatory dental disease, remove plaque and tartar, and clean the tissues beneath the gum line. Severe cases of gingivitis may require antibiotic medication as well as surgery to extract teeth or repair damaged tissue.</p><p>Ideally, cats ' teeth should be brushed regularly after the dental cleaning. However, cats with stomatitis (another oral inflammatory condition) may not tolerate brushing due to pain. Cats with stomatitis often have their teeth removed by a veterinarian to relieve discomfort.</p><p>If your cat's gingivitis is caused by an underlying systemic disease, then that condition will need to be evaluated by your veterinarian to determine the appropriate course of treatment in addition to gingivitis.</p><p>While this disease is not contagious, the factors precipitating gingivitis in one cat are likely affecting other cats in the household, so all cats should be examined.</p><h2>Prognosis for a Cat with Gingivitis</h2><p>If caught early and treated promptly with appropriate dental care, the prognosis for a cat with gingivitis is excellent. You will need to continue to schedule regular checkups and dental cleanings with your vet to help maintain your cat's oral health. Severe gingivitis that requires antibiotics or surgery can make it more difficult for your cat to recover quickly, but with attentive home care, your cat's mouth can heal over time.</p><h2>How to Prevent Gingivitis</h2><p>The most effective ways to prevent gingivitis are to establish a daily dental care routine (including tooth brushing), feed an appropriate diet, and schedule annual veterinary visits and dental cleanings as recommended. Introduce the concept of tooth brushing slowly and always use toothbrushes and toothpaste specifically designed for cats. Cat toothpaste, for example, has been formulated to be palatable. It doesn 't foam or need to be rinsed, and it doesn 't contain fluoride, which is toxic to cats.</p>",799
90,https://www.thesprucepets.com/uveitis-in-cats-5184420,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Uveitis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Uveitis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Uveitis is a painful eye inflammation affecting a cat's uvea that can potentially occur as a result of another underlying cause and it should not be ignored. It can progress to permanent blindness if left untreated. Knowing how to recognize the sometimes subtle signs can help keep your cat comfortable and fully sighted.</p><h2>What Is Uveitis?</h2><p>Uveitis occurs when the uvea, a part of a cat's eye, becomes inflamed. The uvea actually consists of three parts of the eye: the iris, the choroid, and the ciliary body. The different parts of the uvea play various roles within the eye and are important for maintaining eye pressure, vision, the shape of the eye, and more. Any or all of these parts of the uvea may become inflamed with uveitis.</p><p>Depending on what part or parts of the uvea become inflamed, uveitis can be classified in three different ways and may occur in one or both eyes.</p><h2>Symptoms of Uveitis in Cats</h2><p>Some of the symptoms of uveitis can be very subtle since the damage may be occurring deep in the eye and only a veterinarian can spot it with specific tools used to diagnose the condition. However, if you see a change in your pet's behavior based on some of the following signs, call your vet for an exam.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Pawing at Eyes</h3><p>Cats with uveitis are usually in a lot of pain and will be pawing at the affected eye.</p><h3>Keeping Eyes Shut</h3><p>A cat with this disease will commonly hold the painful eye or eyes shut.</p><h3>Avoiding Being Pet on the Head</h3><p>Your cat may show aggression or reluctance when you attempt to pet it on its head, which is usually a response to avoid further pain.</p><h3>Squinting</h3><p>Your cat may stay in a state of static or repeated squinting in an attempt to relieve the pain or to try to see better.</p><h3>Repeated Blinking</h3><p>A cat with this condition may blink repeatedly as a way to try to relieve the pain.</p><h3>Avoiding Bright Light</h3><p>Avoidance of bright lights is not uncommon when a cat has this disease.</p><h3>Eye Redness</h3><p>The blood vessels in the eyes of a cat with uveitis may be more pronounced than usual due to the swelling and inflammation in the area.</p><h3>Eye Discharge</h3><p>Additionally, sometimes clear, white, or purulent discharge may be seen in the corner of the eye in a cat with uveitis.</p><h3>Cloudiness of the Eye</h3><p>If you are able to get a look at your cat's eye, there may be inflammation in or around the eye and it may appear cloudy or even tinged with blood.</p><h3>Protruding Third Eyelid</h3><p>A cat's third eyelid may become involuntarily visible. This could occur for a number of reasons but may be because the eye is inflamed, there's extreme intraocular pressure, or an infection is affecting the nerves that make the third eyelid functional.</p><h3>Bumping Into Things</h3><p>If left untreated, blindness can occur and your cat may start bumping into things in your home.</p><h2>Causes of Uveitis</h2><p>There are numerous reasons why a cat may develop uveitis in one or both eyes or in different parts of the eye. Common causes of uveitis in one eye could be the result of trauma to the area, parasites, or cancer. If uveitis affects both eyes, it may be due to a viral or bacterial infection (such as FIP or feline leukemia), immune-mediated disease (such as FIV), or a metabolic disease (such as diabetes) that's causing an extreme inflammatory response in your cat.</p><h2>Diagnosing Uveitis in Cats</h2><p>If you suspect your cat has uveitis or another eye issue, your veterinarian will need to perform a full physical examination.</p><p>Your regular veterinarian may even refer your cat to a veterinary ophthalmologist for further examination and diagnostic testing depending on the cause and severity of the uveitis.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The treatment of uveitis will vary depending on the underlying reason for it but regardless of the cause, the inflammation and pain in the eye should be addressed. Eye drops and various oral medications may be used to help relieve the discomfort your cat is experiencing, decrease the inflammation in the eye, and treat or prevent infection. The condition can clear up within 24 hours to a few days of treatment. If therapy to relieve the pain in your cat's eyes fails, removal of the affected eye or eyes may be necessary.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Uveitis</h2><p>A cat treated in a timely manner for uveitis will have an excellent outcome. If the uveitis is recurrent or complicated, your vet may refer you to a veterinarian ophthalmologist. A cat untreated for uveitis may develop glaucoma, cataracts, retinal detachment, or retinal degeneration which can lead to blindness.</p>",752

Since these types of tumors are internal, they are not able to be seen without advanced imaging, but that doesn't mean you can't watch for symptoms that they cause. Knowing what kind of symptoms brain tumors can cause in cats can help you to seek help for them as soon as possible.</p><h2>What Are Brain Tumors?</h2><p>A tumor in your cat's brain is a growth of abnormal cells. These growths are usually classified as primary or secondary.</p><h2>Symptoms of Brain Tumors in Cats</h2><p>Different types of tumors can cause different symptoms in your cat, but they are usually broken down into two types: neurological (affecting the nervous system) and vestibular (affecting body movement).</p><h3>Excessive Pacing and Circling</h3><p>Most commonly you will see compulsive circling and excessive pacing, especially if the tumor is located in the forebrain.</p><h3>Eyesight Problems</h3><p>Issues with the cranial nerves will cause problems with eyesight and eye reflexes and may result in a cat bumping into things.</p><h3>Seizures</h3><p>A seizure is an aggressive symptom that is often observed in a cat with a brain tumor. It is typically one of the first indications that a cat is ill.</p><h3>Disturbed Sleep Patterns</h3><p>Some conditions occur depending on the location of the tumor. If the tumor is swelling or painful it can cause sleep abnormalities in a cat.</p><h3>Head Tilt</h3><p>Eye twitching called nystagmus, an unfocused rolling of the eyes, and a head tilt are classic signs of a vestibular problem, but they can also indicate vestibular disease and not just a brain tumor.</p><h3>Weakness and Balance Issues</h3><p>As the tumor grows in the brain, it can put pressure on various areas that control bodily functions. As a result, your cat may fall over involuntarily if it has a brain tumor. Weakness and ataxia (stumbling or staggering when a cat walks) are also commonly seen in a cat with a brain tumor.</p><h2>Causes of Brain Tumors</h2><p>There isn't a lot of research regarding the causes of brain tumors in cats. However, it is thought that factors that could have an impact include genetics, environmental causes, diet, certain viruses, and trauma. There is emerging research regarding familial meningioma in cats in which multiple cats from the same litter could potentially develop this common type of tumor, but more studies are necessary to confirm this possibility.</p><h2>Diagnosing Brain Tumors in Cats</h2><p>The first step in finding out whether or not your cat has a brain tumor is to take it to the vet. Your vet will discuss the symptoms you are seeing at home, observe your cat in the exam room, and perform a thorough physical examination to check for abnormalities.</p><p>Some owners opt to run these diagnostic tests so that they can know exactly what their cat has and provide a course of treatment. Others opt not to do testing and choose to just keep their cat comfortable with palliative care.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery may be options that are discussed to treat your cat's specific brain tumor. Even without running diagnostic tests, some of these options may still be available.</p><p>Over half of the brain tumors found in cats are intracranial meningiomas. This type of tumor may be able to be completely removed so surgical treatment is often the best option for a cat. Meningioma may be considered a type of a benign tumor since it's slow-growing and rarely returns, however, it will still cause neurological symptoms in your cat.</p><p>For many brain tumors, though, there is no cure, but some treatments may buy you some extra time with your cat by delaying growth and spread.</p><p>Palliative care is an option that provides management of the symptoms of a brain tumor for as long as possible. It aims to maintain or improve your cat's quality of life and may include pain medications and steroids.</p><p>You'll want to discuss your options and what they involve with your family and veterinarian to choose the right steps for you and your cat. Not every cat is well-suited for chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, and many drug options require special at-home care for the safe removal of feces as well as a strict schedule of medication administration.</p><h2>Prognosis of Cats With Brain Tumors</h2><p>The prognosis for a cat with a brain tumor will vary depending on the type of tumor, severity, stage, and chosen treatment. For example, some cats diagnosed with meningiomas may live up to ten years with surgery to remove the tumor while others may only live one or two years.</p><p>The most important thing to monitor is your cat's quality of life, regardless of whether or not treatment is selected. Appetite, eliminating in the litter box, socialization, playing with favorite toys, and other normal activities for your cat are things to monitor. When these things are no longer normal daily activities, it may, unfortunately, be time to discuss euthanasia with your veterinarian.</p><h2>How to Prevent Brain Tumors</h2><p>There is no prevention for brain tumors in cats. Both males and females are equally at risk, and older cats may be more likely to develop brain tumors.</p>",834
92,https://www.thesprucepets.com/addisons-disease-in-cats-5070428,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Addison's Disease in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Addison's Disease in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Addison's disease is a disease of the adrenal glands. It causes decreased production of a vital steroid hormone called aldosterone. While many animals, including humans and dogs, can develop Addison's disease, it is rare in cats. When it does occur, it mostly strikes middle-aged cats, leading to symptoms that include vomiting, weight loss, lethargy, and loss of appetite. If left untreated, Addison's disease can eventually cause kidney failure or cause the cat to go into shock. Luckily, if treated before the disease becomes severe, most cats go on to lead normal lives, but will require lifelong medication.</p><h2>What Is Addison's Disease?</h2><p>Addison's disease, also known as hypoadrenocorticism, is a disease of the adrenal glands. Located right in front of the kidneys, these small glands produce several hormones that are crucial for maintaining proper body function. Addison's disease occurs when the adrenal glands are unable to produce enough aldosterone. This steroid hormone plays a vital role in balancing the levels of potassium and sodium in the bloodstream. As a result of the low aldosterone production, excessive amounts of potassium and reduced amounts of sodium accumulate in the cat's blood, leading to cardiovascular and other organ complications.</p><h2>Symptoms of Addison's Disease in Cats</h2><p>Cats with Addison's disease may not be consistently sick until the disease has progressed. Early on, your cat may have periods of being well followed by periods of lethargy, vomiting, weight loss, and lack of appetite.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>It's easy to overlook the signs of Addison's disease, as in many cats, it initially presents only with occasional spells of lethargy, lack of appetite, and weight loss. Some cats will have bouts of vomiting, as well. Since these are common symptoms of many minor ailments, many owners don't consider them important enough to seek veterinary care for their cats, particularly because the cat generally seems well between the attacks of illness.</p><p>Unfortunately, when left untreated, the condition can progress, eventually leading to an adrenal crisis (failure of the adrenal glands) where the cat goes into kidney failure and shock. This typically presents as extreme weakness, slow heartbeat, and severe dehydration. At this point, without prompt veterinary care, the cat is likely to die.</p><h2>Causes of Addison's Disease</h2><p>Addison's disease is rare in cats. It is thought to occur as a result of an autoimmune condition where the body's own immune system attacks the adrenal glands, causing damage that reduces hormone production. It can also occur if a cat has an adrenal gland mass or tumor, although this is very uncommon.</p><h2>Diagnosing Addison's Disease in Cats</h2><p>In order to diagnose a cat with Addison's disease, your veterinarian will start by performing a full physical examination and obtaining a patient history. If Addison's disease is suspected, a series of diagnostic tests will be recommended to check organ function and look for any indications of disease. Typically, the cat will have very high blood levels of potassium and abnormally low levels of sodium. Blood tests of kidney function may also be abnormal.</p><p>To confirm the diagnosis, your vet will likely also order an ACTH (adrenocorticotropic hormone) stimulation test. The test involves checking the cat's response to an injection of ACTH. A cat with Addison's disease will show reduced hormonal response to the injection.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The severity of your cat's Addison's disease will determine the treatment course. If the cat is in shock or adrenal crisis, then emergency treatment will include IV fluids to help correct dehydration and restore electrolyte levels to normal. Possibly, your veterinarian will start emergency steroid treatment as well.</p><p>Hormone replacement treatment can often be started while the animal is being stabilized. Addison's disease cannot be cured, so lifelong management of the disease is necessary with the use of medications. Typically, your cat will require two medications: a steroid, such as prednisone or hydrocortisone and a mineralocorticoid medication, such as DOCP, which helps regulate blood levels of electrolytes, including sodium and potassium. Most cats will be on these two medications for the rest of their lives. Both can be given as a long-lasting injection or a daily pill.</p><p>Because periods of stress can trigger an adrenal crisis, your vet might recommend adjusting medications whenever your cat is likely to be stressed, such as during a move, when introducing a new pet to the home, or when your cat needs to stay at a kennel or boarding facility.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Addison's Disease</h2><p>With treatment, most cats with Addison's disease lead fairly normal lives. They will require more frequent veterinary checkups than the average cat, however. The prognosis is poorer for cats that experience adrenal crisis or that have Addison's disease brought on by a tumor rather than an autoimmune disease.</p><h2>How to Prevent Addison's Disease</h2><p>Because Addison's disease is caused by an uncommon autoimmune response, it cannot be predicted or prevented in cats. However, feeding your cat a balanced diet, maintaining a healthy weight, providing play and exercise opportunities, and taking your cat for regular veterinary checkups can help keep your pet in tiptop shape and ward off other health issues that might reduce your cat's overall quality of life.</p>",836

Yet, neurological disorders can occur in cats, just as they can in humans. In fact, similar to humans, a cat's central nervous system works with a complex network of nerves to send messages to the body. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord, that then travel to the nerves, telling organs and muscles how to function. When something in the body interferes with these signals, a variety of problems can occur. Some neurological diseases can be treated or managed with medicines, and others with surgery.</p><h2>What Is a Neurological Disorder?</h2><p>Neurological disorders result from a disruption to your cat's nervous system. If the issue is in the brain, seizures may be present. However, an infection in the spinal cord may result in an unsteady gait, problems with limb functioning, or complete paralysis. A disruption of nerves can affect almost any part of your cat's body including its face, mouth, legs, or paws. And since the nervous system affects most of your cat's major bodily functions, issues with balance, speech (meowing), eating, urinating, and defecating can also be present if there is a neurological issue present.</p><h2>Symptoms of Neurological Disorders in Cats</h2><p>A large range of symptoms can accompany a neurological disease, and if there is a lesion, it depends on its location and cause. However, a cat can't tell you if they're dizzy, disoriented, or depressed, so looking for physical representations of distress is crucial in diagnosis. If you spot any of the following signs and symptoms of neurological disorders, contact your veterinarian immediately as they could be serious.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Seizures</h3><p>Your cat may suddenly go into a series of seizures if it has a neurological disorder. Seizures-sudden episodes of abnormal electrical activity in the brain-usually involve some loss of body control, such as twitching, convulsing, and involuntary urination/defecation. There's a possibility your cat may have epilepsy if it is having seizures. If your cat is experiencing seizures that occur minutes apart (10 to 15 minutes), call your veterinarian immediately.</p><h3>Sudden Blindness</h3><p>If your cat has experienced an injury to its brain, it may experience sudden blindness, in addition to other symptoms on this list.</p><h3>Walking Difficulties</h3><p>A cat with a neurological disorder may present with the inability to walk. It may also walk with a drunken gait (ataxia) or begin to walk in circles.</p><h3>Paralysis</h3><p>There are many reasons a cat may experience partial or full paralysis, including neurological disorders. You can tell if your cat is paralyzed if it can't move its head, including its tongue or neck. If your cat is unable to move its legs, back, or tail, it may be paralyzed.</p><h3>Muscle Twitching</h3><p>Muscle twitching or tremors may be harder to spot and might require spending some quiet time studying your cat to determine if it's part of the list of symptoms indicating a possible neurological disorder.</p><h3>Rapid Eye Movements</h3><p>If you see that your cat's eyes are moving back and forth abnormally, involuntarily, and rapidly, this is called nystagmus and it can indicate a neurological disorder.</p><h3>Head Tilt</h3><p>Your cat may have a vestibular disease (inner ear disorder) which is causing your pet to feel unbalanced. If your cat is feeling dizzy or disoriented, it will tilt its head along with other symptoms, such as confusion or having difficulties walking.</p><h3>Confusion</h3><p>Take note if your cat is suddenly acting disoriented or confused. Call your veterinarian immediately if you notice this change in your cat's personality.</p><h2>Causes of Neurological Disorders</h2><p>Sometimes, a vet's examination, combined with a few diagnostic tests, will unveil the cause of your cat's neurological dysfunction.</p><h2>Diagnosing Neurological Disorders in Cats</h2><p>A complete neurological evaluation must be conducted at a vet's office. First, your veterinarian will ask about your cat's medical history.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Treating neurological disorders in cats starts with diagnosing the disorder, and care varies greatly based on the diagnosis.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Neurological Disorders</h2><p>Depending on the cause, administering daily medication could lengthen the quality of your cat's life. If a malignant brain tumor is the cause of the disorder, there may be many factors that determine your cat's prognosis. Palliative care, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgical removal can help.</p><h2>How to Prevent Neurological Disorders</h2><p>Many neurological disorders aren't preventable, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle keeps any cat in tip-top shape. Feed your cat high-quality food as recommended by your veterinarian throughout adulthood. Allow it ample space to romp, play, and exercise. And always give your cat love and attention.</p>",744
94,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-eye-infections-5184393,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>How to Identify Cat Eye Infections</h1>,"<h1>How to Identify Cat Eye Infections</h1><p>Eye infections in cats can be uncomfortable and sometimes even painful. If your cat has an eye infection, they may have any number of symptoms. How can you know when your cat may be suffering from an eye infection and what can you do about it?</p><h2>Signs Your Cat Might Have an Eye Infection</h2><p>Not all cats with an eye infection may exhibit the same symptoms. In fact, your cat may only have one or two clinical signs of an infection.</p><p>Infections of the eye can be quite irritating for your cat. A cat that is suffering from one might also be exhibiting behavioral changes, such as hiding more and being more temperamental.</p><h2>Potential Causes of Eye Infections in Cats</h2><p>Your cat's eye problem could truly be an infection, having a bacterial or viral cause, but not all eye infections are actually infectious in nature. There are some types of eye 'infections' that can be caused by things that aren't bacterial or viral.</p><h3>Calicivirus</h3><p>The 'C' in the FVRCP (sometimes called a feline distemper or a 3-way shot) vaccine, calicivirus is a virus that can cause both upper respiratory and oral infections in both domestic cats as well as wild cats. It is highly contagious from cat to cat and is commonly seen in both shelter and cattery environments.</p><h3>Feline Herpes Virus</h3><p>Yes, cats can get herpes. In fact, it's quite common in cats. Feline herpes virus is the causative agent for a disease process called feline viral rhinotracheitis, the 'FVR' in the FVRCP vaccine. While feline herpes virus is not transmissible to people, once a cat gets it they have the virus for life.</p><h3>Conjunctivitis</h3><p>Literally meaning 'inflammation of the conjunctiva', this is most similar to pink eye in people. However, you can't get pink eye from your cat. Conjunctivitis can occur on its own or it can be seen in association with other eye disorders, such as calicivirus and feline herpesvirus.</p><h3>Corneal Ulcers</h3><p>Your cat's eye, just like your own eye, has a thin layer covering the front portion of the eye called the cornea. If your cat accidentally scratches their cornea, they can form a painful ulcer.</p><h2>Treatment Options for Your Cat's Eye Infection</h2><p>Whether your cat's eye infection is caused by an infectious or non-infectious agent, the treatment is most often standard. Most home remedies or over-the-counter topical treatments won't be effective at fully clearing the infection, so a veterinary visit is in order. To make sure they pick the right medication, your vet will want to stain your cat's eye to check for any corneal scratches or ulcers. A few drops of a non-toxic, fluorescent dye is placed in the eye and a black light is shone on the eye. Any corneal ulcers will hold on to the dye and will shine a yellow-green color. Checking for any ulcers or scratches is important because it will determine if your vet will prescribe eye drops with a steroid or without one. Eye drops that contain a steroid can help relieve the pain and inflammation associated with the infection, but it will also delay the healing of a corneal ulcer and may actually make it worse. For this reason, a vet will always want to stain the eyes before prescribing anything.</p><p>Once the testing is complete your vet will prescribe eye drops or ointment for inflammation or infection as warranted. Some owner's find that the drops are easier for to apply at home, while others prefer the ointment. The veterinarian will guide you as to which option they think will help your cat's eye best.</p><h2>Preventing Eye Infections in Cats</h2><p>Looking at the potential causes of eye infections, it may seem like preventing them would be a daunting task. But there are things you can do to prevent your cat from suffering from one.</p><p>Keeping your cat up to date on their vaccines regardless of indoor/outdoor status, can help reduce chances of infection. Even if your vet suspects that your cat already has feline herpesvirus, it is still important to keep up with their vaccines as recommended by your veterinarian. Most flare ups of herpesvirus are self-limiting, meaning they resolve without treatment. If your vet suspects that this is the culprit of your cat's eye problems, they may recommend an immune supplement called L-Lysine. This is a safe supplement that can be given either as a treat or chew, as a gel your cat can lick off their paw, or even granules you can mix in with their wet food. L-Lysine can be given throughout your cat's life to prevent flare ups. Keeping your cat's claws trimmed, especially their front claws, can also help prevent any corneal ulcers or scratches from exuberant grooming.</p><p>Eye infections usually aren't serious, but they are unpleasant for your cat to endure. If you suspect your cat is suffering from an eye infection, don't delay in calling your vet to make an appointment for them.</p>",808
95,https://www.thesprucepets.com/urine-specific-gravity-what-it-measures-3384820,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>What Is Urine Specific Gravity?</h1>,"<h1>What Is Urine Specific Gravity?</h1><p>Urine specific gravity is a term used to describe urine concentration. When your pet has a urinalysis that is performed by a veterinarian, urine specific gravity is one of the many things measured for both cats and dogs. This test is also given to humans as a diagnostic tool. An animal's urine specific gravity measurement is used in conjunction with other test results to evaluate a pet's health. The measurement will help the veterinarian evaluate your pet's renal function by assessing whether ingested water is being excreted or sustained in the body at appropriate levels.</p><h2>What Is Urine Specific Gravity?</h2><p>Urine specific gravity, often abbreviated as USG, is a measurement of urine concentration as compared to pure water. The specific gravity of pure or distilled water is 1.000. The specific gravity of urine is higher because of the substances found in urine. How much higher will depend on several factors.</p><p>The hydration level of an animal is important to consider when evaluating the significance of a pet's urine specific gravity. A dehydrated animal typically has a high urine specific gravity while an overhydrated animal usually has a low urine specific gravity. It's important to note that a pet's urine specific gravity will fluctuate throughout the day, which is completely normal. This measurement is especially important for cats because felines typically do not drink enough water, and cats eating more dry food than wet food may not ingest enough moisture.</p><p>Health problems can affect both hydration and urine concentration. Vets will use urine specific gravity values in part to make medical diagnoses, but other test results are generally factored into the process. Urine specific gravity is a valuable tool to evaluate a pet's kidney function.</p><h2>How Vets Measure Urine Specific Gravity</h2><p>Urine specific gravity is measured using a tool called a refractometer. This instrument uses light to measures the density of the urine. Urine can be collected at home if possible, or at the veterinarian's office using specific techniques that will not hurt your pet and may also be used to access uncontaminated urine. Then a drop of the urine is placed on the glass of the refractometer and the cover is closed. The refractometer is held up to the light where it is refracted (changes direction due to the light). The lab technician looks though a lens to read the result.</p><p>Urine specific gravity may also be measured on a urine test strip, but the results are considered unreliable and are often contradicted when checked on a refractometer.</p><h2>Normal Urine Specific Gravity in Pets</h2><p>There is no one ""normal"" urine specific gravity in pets. The measurement varies greatly even in healthy animals. In general, the normal range in pets is 1.001 to &gt;1.045. Cats and dogs will have slightly different ranges. Multiple urine samples may need to be collected throughout the day in order to get a better idea of the animal's normal range. Other lab tests are greatly needed to assess a pet's health.</p><p>Hydration status greatly influences an animal's urine specific gravity, but other factors can affect the levels. Certain medications and disease processes will affect the urine specific gravity as well. In general, concentrated urine usually means that an animal is dehydrated while dilute urine suggests that the kidneys are not functioning normally.</p><h2>Abnormal Urine Specific Gravity in Pets</h2><p>Urine is considered concentrated if the USG is over 1.030 in a dog or over 1.035 in a cat. If the pet is already over-hydrated, then a USG over 1.007 is considered high.</p><p>Urine is considered dilute if the USG is less than 1.008. If the animal is dehydrated, then the urine is considered too dilute if it is less than 1.030 in dogs or more than 1.035 in cats.</p><p>Urine specific gravity values in the 1.008 to 1.010 range are termed . This happens when the kidneys are unable to concentrate the urine more than that of protein-free plasma. A single reading in this range does not necessarily indicate kidney disease. The veterinarian will want to examine your pet, do blood work to check blood urea nitrogen and creatinine to assess kidney function, and consider other factors such as water intake, any medications, and concurrent diseases that may be present.</p><p>In the absence of other reasons for an isosthenuria urine, vets will likely want to repeat the urine specific gravity reading on the first urine sample of the morning. This is when urine is typically the most concentrated.</p>",730
96,https://www.thesprucepets.com/senior-dementia-in-cats-3384896,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Dementia in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Dementia in Cats</h1> <p>Thankfully, due to improvements in veterinary care and nutrition, our feline friends are living much longer than they used to. With our cats living longer, it is important to know the health issues associated with this life stage. One issue is a decline in cognitive abilities as a result of aging changes in the brain. Cognitive functions include the mental processes of perception, awareness, learning, and memory, which allow an individual to acquire information about the environment and decide how to act. This is sometimes referred to as dementia, as in humans, but is more correctly termed cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS) in cats. </p><h2>What Is Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome?</h2><p>Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome in cats (CDS) is a cognitive disease prevalent in cats, directly related to the brain aging, leading to changes in awareness, deficits in learning and memory, and decreased responsiveness to stimuli. It is also known as cognitive dysfunction syndrome (CDS). Alzheimer 's disease and dementia in humans are diseases with comparable symptoms.</p><h2>Symptoms</h2><p>CDS is characterized by behavioral changes, however, these changes can also result from other diseases such as renal failure and hyperthyroidism. Behavioral changes can often be dismissed by owners as, My cat is just getting older.Many behavior changes are symptoms of medical issues. If you notice any behavior changes in your cat, it is important to take your cat to the vet to get a diagnosis and rule out other diseases. CDS is diagnosed once other illnesses are ruled out.</p><h2>How to Diagnose</h2><p>DISHA is an acronym that is commonly used to remember the most common symptoms associated with CDS and can help veterinarians diagnose it in your cat.</p><p>Disorientation: Cat appears lost or confused in a familiar environment which can result in your cat becoming trapped in corners or behind furniture, staring at walls or into space, difficulty finding their resources (food, water bowl, perch, or litter box) and may have memory deficits, for example, forgetting they have been fed and repeatedly requesting more food.</p><p>Interaction changes: Social interactions might be altered between the pet and owner or pet and other pets; some pets may appear to be more clingy, while others might be disinterested or even irritable when petted or approached.</p><p>Sleep-wake cycle: You may notice changes in sleep-wake cycles, your cat used to sleep throughout the night and now wakes up at 4 a.m., abnormal night-time behaviors which can include vocalizing, wandering, pacing, and decreased activity during the day.</p><p>House soiling: Your cat may begin to use the bathroom outside of the litter box.</p><p>Anxiety: Increased anxiety, increased irritability, and your cat becoming withdrawn.</p><p>Activity changes: Decreased exploration and response to things, people, sounds around the house, and decreased grooming or appetite.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Treatment of CDS can be difficult since it cannot be reversed or cured. The goal of treatment is to improve the welfare of the cat by intervention focused on relieving the anxiety, slowing the disease process if possible, and supporting cognitive function. Therapies in the form of dietary change, supplements, medication, and environmental enrichment can help manage cognitive dysfunction syndrome. Your veterinarian will work with you to create a personalized treatment plan to help your cat.</p><p>Keep your cats enriched. We have all heard the saying, use it or lose it, this applies to cats as well. Keeping your cats enriched in the form of exercise, new and interactive toys, and learning new things can lead to increased mental stimulation and an increase in cognitive function.</p><p>Senior-ify your house. As we age, we change our environment to adapt to our needs, but this is not common for cats.</p><h2>Consistency and Predictability</h2><p>Consistency and predictability are important for all of us, including cats. Do your best to maintain a consistent schedule and routine. For example, if you are going out of town, be aware this may not be a big change to you, but it is for your cat. Also, be sure to have your cat sitter feed the cat and have an interactive play session with your cat at the same time you usually do.</p><p>As cats age, it is more difficult for them to deal with changes, even positive changes. Remember this when introducing changes to your cat 's schedule and environment, changes should be made gradually at a pace your cat is comfortable with.</p><p>Can a cat with CDS have a good quality of life? In most cases, yes, but it 's important to recognize that your cat 's needs have changed. Once you understand the changes that accompany aging and work with your veterinarian to manage them, your cat 's senior years can be rewarding for both of you</p>",756
97,https://www.thesprucepets.com/panleukopenia-in-cats-3384884,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Panleukopenia in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Panleukopenia in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Feline panleukopenia (FPV), also known as feline distemper, is a disease that attacks a cat's immune system. FPV causes symptoms like vomiting, dehydration, and depression. The virus is transmittable through contact with infected feces and urine. A vet will diagnose FPV through a physical examination and tests, such as blood analysis. The treatment and prognosis for FPV depend heavily on the severity of the cat's disease but are usually focused on managing symptoms. FPV vaccines are incredibly effective and the surest way to prevent the otherwise likely fatal virus.</p><h2>What Is Panleukopenia?</h2><p>Feline panleukopenia (FPV) is a disease that causes a decrease in a cat's white blood cell count in bone marrow, intestine, and skin and diminishes the ability to fight infection. FPV is highly contagious and can be fatal if untreated. The virus can survive for up to one year in various environments and is resistant to many disinfectants. Kittens and unvaccinated cats are most susceptible to FPV, and outbreaks are likely to occur in shelters, urban stray environments, and farms.The virus can be spread through direct contact with infected cats and indirectly by contact with items contaminated with the virus.</p><p>Pregnant cats can pass FPV to their offspring, and in addition to being born with the virus, their kittens may be stillborn or suffer other developmental abnormalities. Some kittens infected in the later stage of pregnancy or neonatal phase can survive, but the virus may affect their brain development. This may cause cerebellar hypoplasia, which impacts a cat's motor control.</p><h2>Symptoms of Panleukopenia in Cats</h2><p>FPV can cause a wide range of symptoms, many of which are shared by other illnesses. If you suspect your cat is sick or exhibiting abnormal behavior, visit your vet.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Symptoms of lethargy and depression can be challenging to detect in cats, as some cats' normal behavior includes a lot of sleeping. But, if your otherwise social or playful cat loses interest in its toys or avoids contact with humans, something may be wrong. FPV can also cause diarrhea and vomiting, as the virus affects the intestine. Reluctance to drink water and subsequent dehydration is also a telltale sign of FPV. Pay attention to fever in your cat, as well. It may come and go throughout your cat's illness but will suddenly plummet shortly before death.</p><h2>Causes of Panleukopenia</h2><h2>Diagnosing Panleukopenia in Cats</h2><p>A vet will diagnose FPV based on your cat's medical history, exposure, symptoms, and laboratory tests. Your vet will likely conduct a blood analysis to measure your cat's white blood cell count. Stool testing is an option but will often present a false negative as the test is only accurate for a short period after infection.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>There is no cure for FPV, so treatment is directed at managing symptoms. Hospitalization is usually required, and intensive intravenous fluid therapy is necessary to stave off dehydration. Your vet will likely prescribe anti-diuretic and anti-nausea medication. Antibiotics will not treat the virus, but your veterinarian may administer them to prevent or fight secondary bacterial infections. In severe cases, blood transfusions may be necessary.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Panleukopenia</h2><p>The prognosis for cats with FPV is guarded but significantly better if the cat is otherwise healthy and receives swift treatment. If a cat with FPV survives for more than five days, its prognosis improves significantly. Cats with severe FPV that have received in-hospital treatment have a 20%&ndash;51% chance of survival, while an untreated cat has a 10% chance. Kittens have a poor chance of recovery.</p><h2>How to Prevent Panleukopenia</h2><p>Vaccination against FPV is the best prevention method. The FPV vaccine is very effective and is included in routine vaccinations given to domestic cats, usually starting at six to eight weeks old. Visit your vet to discuss the best vaccination plan for your cat.</p><p>Besides vaccination, the only way to prevent transmission of FPV is to isolate the infected cat, dispose of any materials with which it may have come into contact, and closely monitor the cat population. Still, FPV is incredibly contagious, so there is no guarantee that the spread will be contained even if preventative measures are taken. After the symptoms resolve, infected cats can still spread the virus for several weeks.</p>",689
98,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-cats-4585146,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affects a cat's left ventricle, inhibiting blood flow and potentially causing health issues throughout its body. Cats don't always show symptoms of HCM, but when they do, symptoms may include labored breathing, collapse, and an irregular heartbeat. HCM is caused by a mutated gene and disproportionately affects Maine coons, rag dolls, Persians, sphynxs, Chartreuxs, and British shorthairs. A vet will diagnose HCM with a comprehensive physical examination and diagnostic tests like an electrocardiogram. Because the cause of the mutated gene isn't understood, HCM can't be prevented. The prognosis is good for asymptomatic cats but varies for cats showing signs of heart failure.</p><h2>What Is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?</h2><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition that causes the muscular walls of the heart to thicken, especially the left ventricle-the primary pumping chamber of the heart. As a result, the left ventricle shrinks, enlarging the left aorta, and potentially leading to heart disease. When the left ventricle thickens, the heart can't adequately pump blood, creating other problems in the body, including blood clots and congestive heart failure. HCM causes the heart rate to increase to compensate for the lack of proper blood flow, and, in doing so, depletes the body of oxygen, killing heart cells. When the cells die, the heart function decreases even more. HCM is the most common heart condition in cats.</p><h2>Symptoms of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats</h2><p>Not all cats present HCM symptoms, but they may come on suddenly and acutely if they do. If your cat seems ill, visit your vet right away.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The symptoms of HCM in a cat will typically resemble those of congestive heart failure. Labored breathing is usually identifiable by observing your cat taking quick breaths and wheezing audibly. You may notice its abdomen rising and falling instead of the chest, an open mouth, heavy panting, and pale or blue gums. The lack of oxygen can lead to weakness and collapse. HCM can also cause sudden hind limb paralysis if a clot travels out of the heart and blocks blood flow to the legs. This onsets suddenly and is sometimes accompanied by the limb feeling cold to the touch.</p><h2>Causes of Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h2><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is an inherited disease caused by a mutated gene. Certain breeds are more likely to develop hypertrophic cardiomyopathy than others. Maine coons, ragdolls, Persians, sphynxs, Chartreuxs, and British shorthairs have a genetic predisposition to HCM. The reason for the genetic mutation is unknown.</p><h2>Diagnosing Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy in Cats</h2><p>To diagnose your cat with HCM, your vet will begin with a full physical examination and search for an abnormal heart rhythm. If your vet finds a heartbeat irregularity, they will likely perform an echocardiogram which will create an image of your cat's heart and show the thickened wall if present. Your vet will rule out other illnesses may cause thickening of the left ventricle, with additional diagnostic tests before making an HCM diagnosis. Your vet will likely run blood analysis and urinalysis in addition to imaging tests.</p><h2>Treatment & Prevention</h2><p>Treatment for HCM depends on the severity and stage of the condition. Overall, treatment is aimed at improving heart function, limiting the symptoms of heart disease, and minimizing the chance of blood clots developing. While you can take measures to manage HCM, there is no cure. Your vet may administer oral or injection medications if your cat is healthy enough to tolerate them. If your cat suffers from breathing problems due to HCM, your vet may suggest oxygen therapy. In addition to medication, your cat may be placed on a low-sodium or high fatty acid diet, and your vet may recommend keeping your cat's activity level and stress level low to minimize strain on the heart.</p><p>Because HCM is an inherited disease, it isn't preventable, but providing proper nutrition to support the heart and keeping up with annual veterinarian examinations is essential to ensuring your cat's heart is healthy.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy</h2><p>HCM is a progressive disease and will worsen over time. The prognosis for cats with HCM varies depending on your cat's symptoms. Some cats whose symptoms progress rapidly will die suddenly, while others with slow onset will live unaffected lives. Early detection of HCM is essential to enlongating your cat's life as much as possible</p>",703
99,https://www.thesprucepets.com/skin-tags-and-cats-5070069,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Diseases & Disorders,<h1>What Are Skin Tags on Cats?</h1>,"<h1>What Are Skin Tags on Cats?</h1><p>Cats can get skin tags just like people do. Fortunately, most skin tags are nothing to worry about. However, it's important to understand what a skin tag is and how to tell the difference between skin tags and other types of skin growths.</p><h2>What Is a Cat Skin Tag?</h2><p>A skin tag is a fleshy skin mass that can appear anywhere on a cat's body. They are generally composed of blood vessels and collagen and covered with skin. Skin tags are typically soft, flesh-colored bumps that are slightly raised or dangle from a stalk. Some skin tags start small and gradually grow larger while others remain the same size. Most are non-painful and benign (not cancerous). Benign skin tags in cats are usually only a problem if they're in a location that bothers the cat.</p><p>The actual cause of skin tags in cats is not known, but there are several theories out there. One thought is that friction plays a role in the development of skin tags, but they do not always occur where normal friction occurs (like in skin folds).</p><h2>Is It Really a Skin Tag?</h2><p>Before assuming the bump on your cat is a skin tag, consider the other things it could be to determine the best course of action.</p><h3>Ticks</h3><p>Many people mistake skin tags for ticks and try to remove them. Take a closer look before you attempt to remove what looks like a tick from your cat. Tugging on a skin tag will be painful to your cat and can irritate the skin tag and the skin around it.</p><h3>Nipples</h3><p>Don't forget that all mammals have nipples-including cats! Even male cats have tiny nipples on their bellies that look quite a bit like skin tags. If you find a bump on your cat's abdomen or chest, check the other side for a matching one. Most cats have four pairs of nipples that run along their underside.</p><h3>Warts</h3><p>Though rare, cats can sometimes get benign viral warts called papillomas. These may spread from cat to cat but cannot spread to humans or dogs. Most papillomas will fade over time and can return periodically in different areas.</p><h3>Skin Tumors</h3><p>Malignant skin growths can appear in many different forms. Don't assume a skin growth is a benign skin tag-be sure to watch how it grows and changes. Any new growth on your cat should be checked out by a veterinarian, especially if it changes in shape, size, or color or begins to bother the cat.</p><h2>Treatment of Skin Tags in Cats</h2><p>Many skin tags are harmless and do not need treatment. Some need to be removed if they are painful or irritated. Skin tags may become irritated when they are rubbing against another part of the body or a collar. Cats may also irritate skin tags while grooming themselves.</p><p>Never attempt to remove a skin tag yourself! Although some people are comfortable removing their own skin tags at home, trying to do this to your cat is almost definitely going to backfire. Your cat will be in pain and may bite or scratch you. DIY skin tag removal is risky for bleeding and infection.</p><p>If you find a mass that looks like a skin tag, watch it closely. Note the size, shape, and color of the skin tag and check it frequently for changes. If the skin tag is unchanged and your cat is not showing any signs of illness, it can probably wait for your next annual or biannual routine veterinary checkup. If there are changes to the skin tag, contact your veterinarian for advice and to schedule an examination.</p><p>Your vet will talk to you about your cat's history and perform an examination on your cat. The vet will look at and palpate the growth in order to determine the next step. If the vet thinks it is nothing to worry about, then there should be no treatment needed. If the growth seems suspicious or problematic, then your vet will recommend the next step.</p><p>If your vet recommends removing the growth, surgery may be necessary. Small growths can sometimes be removed by freezing or snipped off after giving a local anesthetic. Surgery for larger growths will require sedation or general anesthesia. The removed mass may be sent to a veterinary pathologist to determine what types of cells it contains. Histopathology can determine if the mass is benign or malignant. It can also reveal if the growth is viral or bacterial.</p>",730

But many cat owners don't realize that it's almost just as easy for cats to go missing, from squeezing through a door that was accidentally left open to escaping from an unsecured pet carrier on the way to the vet.</p><p>Meanwhile, some cats simply have an adventurous side, and will stop at nothing to claw or chew through a window screen or figure out how to open a door latch on their own, and if you have an indoor/outdoor cat, it's always possible to ""lose"" your kitty inside the garage or a backyard shed when the weather changes and they seek out shelter.</p><p>If your cat does go missing, here are some steps you should take to bring him or her home.</p><h2>Get the Word Out</h2><p>Many cat owners will end up playing the waiting game on an outdoor cat to return home on his own before they start taking steps to find their lost pet, but it's important not to wait too long, especially when you consider all of the dangers that are lurking outdoors, from cars to wild animals. The good news is that most cats don't like to travel far from home, so if you've determined that your cat truly is missing, more than likely they're hiding somewhere without a few hundred feet of the house.</p><p>Posting fliers with your cat's name and description and your contact information (and a reward, if applicable) around the neighborhood is always a good bet, but you'll also want to take advantage of social media sites like Facebook and Instagram to share images and information about your lost cat while recruiting your friends and family to share your posts. There are also Facebook groups dedicated to recovering lost pets in your area.</p><p>Also be sure to distribute fliers to (and call) local animal shelters and veterinary offices, as well as posting your cat's photo on their social media sites whenever possible. If there are groups in your area working with local community cat colonies, they may also be able to help you find your cat. Don't be shy when it comes to recruiting your neighbors, as most people will be more than happy to check their trees or underneath their porches for you, and be sure to provide them with instructions on the best way to approach your cat to help prevent them from running away when spotted.</p><h2>Rely on Their Identification</h2><p>All dog and cat owners should microchip their pets and ensure that the chips are registered with the most up-to-date contact information, and another important preventive tool is the cat collar. Hopefully, your cat is equipped with both of these methods of identification, particularly since most people won't look twice if they spot a loose cat without a collar because they'll assume it's a stray. You'll want to be sure to include a description of your cat's collar in any fliers or social media posts, as well as alert the microchip company immediately that your cat is missing.</p><h2>Know Where to Look</h2><p>When your cat doesn't show up for dinner, the first thing to do is explore every nook and cranny of your home because it's all too easy for cats to get trapped somewhere like a closet or a corner of the garage, and they simply can't find their way out.</p><p>If your cat is definitely not in the house, head outside and get down on your hands and knees and you may also want to pull that ladder out of the garage. Cats have a natural tendency to seek out both high and low hiding places, as well as anywhere that's small and enclosed and they like to be able to observe you without you seeing them. Start your search by looking up towards the trees, underneath the porch, or even inside any empty boxes or containers you may have in the backyard.</p><h2>Lure Your Cat Back Home</h2><p>Sometimes getting your cat to come back home will require a little bit of sneakiness. One idea is to put your cat's bowl and food outside to help them follow the smell and, hopefully, find their way back home. You'll also want to leave a door open whenever possible. There are also cat traps available that can be left out overnight, so if your cat wanders in to enjoy the food you've left inside, you'll be able to retrieve your scared kitty first thing in the morning.</p><h3>Pro Tip</h3><p>An expert way of attracting your cat is to place an unwashed piece of your own clothing outside that your cat can track. If you have access to a night-vision camera, that can also be a helpful tool in locating your cat if they're attempting to get back into the house in the evening hours, as many scared cats will attempt to break into the house when they think you're not looking.</p><h2>Keep Searching</h2><p>It's always a scary experience to lose a four-legged member of your family, but keep in mind that even the most spoiled indoor kitty will likely be able to rely on its natural instincts to survive if it gets trapped in the Great Outdoors. Be sure to remain diligent and persistent in your search for your lost cat, and continue sharing, posting, and searching until he or she is back home.</p>",917

Your cat will probably die before you do, and you may even have to make the decision to help him or her to die. Death is a difficult subject for many people, but avoiding the topic isn't helpful to you or your cat.</p><p>Cats, particularly indoor cats, are now living longer than they have in past years. There are also so many advances in veterinary care that many cats develop chronic health problems that can be handled with treatments at home, such as administering fluids under the skin. Doing different treatments at home may seem difficult at first, but the staff at your veterinarian's office can usually instruct you so that you feel more comfortable with it. Treatments for some diseases, such as radiation or chemotherapy, can't be done at home, are expensive, and have greater risks and side effects.</p><h2>Plan Ahead for the Euthanasia Decision</h2><p>Once an illness strikes, we tend to go into crisis mode and our thinking isn't as clear as it is when we're not stressed, so planning ahead is crucial. One way people have found useful in making these decisions is to ask, ""If this was ME in my cat's situation, how much treatment would I want?"" You may find that you have different boundaries for each of your animals.</p><p>It's important to choose a veterinarian that you trust and have a good relationship with. People who do, often find it helpful to listen to the pros and cons that their veterinarian gives them. Most veterinarians will be very honest with clients about this.</p><h2>Considering the Cost Factor</h2><p>Veterinarians don't make as much money as you might think when you look at their bills, and they have bills of their own that they have to pay, both business and personal, so very few are able to treat your animal inexpensively or for free. There's only so much treatment you'll be able to afford for your animal before it becomes too much to handle.</p><h2>Quality of Life is an Important Issue</h2><p>If you know that your cat is suffering and has no chance of returning to even an adequate level of quality of life, it's time to talk with your veterinarian about euthanasia. If a treatment would result in a less than a 50 percent chance of returning to a good quality of life, you should talk with your veterinarian about whether the treatment is really in the cat's best interest. Once a reasonable level of quality of life is gone, the loving thing to do is to let your animal go.</p><h2>The Euthanization Process</h2><p>Your veterinarian will give your cat a shot to calm him or her and then take your cat to the treatment area to insert an IV. Your cat will then be returned to you and when you're ready, your veterinarian will give an injection that will stop the heartbeat and breathing and your cat will peacefully slip away.Afterward, your veterinarian will ask you if you'd like to spend some time with the body. Many people are confused or even upset that the eyes don't close or if there are some last movements after death; this is normal.</p><p>Some people choose to have a veterinarian come to their house so that their cat can die in familiar surroundings.</p><h2>Handling the Remains</h2><p>Another issue that you should think about long before the time comes is what you'll want to do with your cat's body.</p><p>If you want to bury it on your property, you must check the laws in your area, as this is illegal in many places. Some cities have pet cemeteries and you can get information on cost and services offered so that you can make a decision about this.</p><p>Some people prefer to have the body cremated and returned to them. Many companies sell beautiful urns that are made specifically to store pet ashes.</p><p>Some may make a donation to an animal charity in their cat's name so that an animal who is still on the earth can benefit.</p><h2>Take Time for Yourself</h2><p>Once your cat is dead and you have dealt with the body, it's important to take care of yourself.</p><p>If your friends don't understand the relationship you had, you may want to find achat linewhere you can communicate with people who understand. TheRainbows Bridgesite has one and you can find others on the internet. You may want to make a ""Memory Book"" and put pictures, poems, prayers, cards, and other mementos in it so that you will always have it to remember this time. There are no rules for making one except that it should havemeaningfor you.</p><p>Putting a Memory Book together can be very healing. Some people may choose instead to get an inspirational candle that is sold for this purpose and have a special prayer or ""good-bye"" service. Any ritual that helps you is a good one.</p><p>There are also many books aboutdealing with pet griefthat you can read and get comfort and ideas from. No one wants to saygoodbyeto a furry loved one, but there is great peace in knowing that when the time came, you were able to do the most loving thing.</p>",855

They are a source of entertainment, emotional support, and have individual personalities. In addition, cats often live into their late teens or early twenties so they are in our lives for a very long time. Because of this, when they pass away it is natural to feel as though there is a void within you.</p><h2>Losing a Loved One is Hard</h2><p>The loss of any loved one, regardless of whether they are a human or animal, is painful. Death and the emotions it brings are never easy to deal with. When the cat that has died was a constant in your daily life it can be very hard to get through your day without them. But learning to recognize and deal with the situation is an important part of managing the loss of your cat. As hard as it is, there are thankfully some things you can do to help guide yourself through the process of grieving. The process of grieving a pet cat is no different than that of a human family member or any other pet. You will go through the same stages of grief as you would for anyone else.</p><h2>Stages of Grief</h2><p>According to the Kubler-Ross model, there are five stages a person may go through to cope with grief.</p><h3>5 Stages of Grief</h3><p>These stages do not necessarily happen in a specific order but may occur in someone grieving the loss of their cat.</p><h2>Denial of the Loss of Your Cat</h2><p>Denial is typically one of the first stages of grief that you will go through. This stage, like any of the other stages of grief, is different for everyone and you may even skip this stage altogether. You will eventually come to terms with losing your cat but there's nothing wrong with acknowledging that what you are feeling is normal and okay.</p><h2>Anger With the Loss of Your Cat</h2><p>Another stage of grief is anger. You may feel angry at your cat, yourself, a disease, or someone or something else, but remember that it 's okay to feel this way because feelings are always valid. How you react to your feelings is what is important. Yell into your pillow, cry, write down your emotions, work out at the gym, or go for a run and let your mind and body process this anger.</p><p>Remember that it 's okay to be angry, but don 't stay angry longer than necessary or take it out on those around you. It may be easy to lash out or blame whomever is nearby-including your veterinarian-but try to understand that your veterinary staff are there to help and are often also saddened by the loss. Nothing can change what has happened, so you need to remind yourself that you are simply grieving, and being angry is just a part of that. Staying angry for too long will not help anything but at the same time, there is no time limit for grieving.</p><h2>Bargaining About the Loss of Your Cat</h2><p>You may find yourself trying to figure out what you could have done differently to prevent the death of your cat. Some people will express if onlyand what ifsentiments or try to strike a deal with a higher power through prayer to bring their cat back.</p><h2>Depression From the Loss of Your Cat</h2><p>Almost everyone experiences the stage of grief known as depression. Crying, sleeping a lot, not wanting to do anything, feeling lonely, not wanting to eat, and other symptoms of sadness are very normal for you to exhibit after your cat has passed away. Honor these emotions but remind yourself that they will slowly be easier to manage as time goes on and you won 't feel this depressed forever.</p><h2>Acceptance of the Loss of Your Cat</h2><p>It may take some time, but acceptance is a must for anyone who has lost a loved one. If your cat has died, you will inevitably need to adjust to life without them. How you do this may vary from someone else but you must find a way to accept it. You will always miss your cat, but once you accept that they are gone it will slowly get easier to continue on with your life without your cat.</p><h2>Ways to Process Your Grief</h2><p>Different things will help different people cope with the loss of their cat. Some people need to be alone, while others will feel the need to get a new cat as soon as possible.</p>",750

It is a parasite that, while a real concern for certain groups in the population, is often misunderstood when it comes to our feline companions. The parasite often doesn't cause any significant symptoms or concerns in a cat unless your pet has a weak immune system.</p><h2>What Is Toxoplasmosis?</h2><p>Toxoplasmosis is a disease process that is caused by the parasitic organism and, while it is one of the most common parasitic diseases, it does not usually cause any clinical symptoms in cats (or people).</p><p>has a fairly complex life cycle involving different cystic forms and hosts. There are two types of hosts for . A definitive host houses the parasite as it reproduces itself via the production of eggs, called oocysts that will then shed in the host's feces. An intermediate host houses the parasite as it clones itself without the production of eggs.</p><p>Domestic and wild cats are the only type of definitive hosts of and humans are considered intermediate hosts. Though it was a mystery why cats where the chosen definitive host for the parasite, research has shown that can only reproduce in a cat because the feline contains a very specific type of essential fatty acid.</p><h2>Symptoms of Toxoplasmosis in Cats</h2><p>Most healthy cats never become clinically ill from an infection by . The risk of clinical disease if your cat does become infected is low. Some of the organisms in a cat may deeply embed themselves within the intestinal walls and multiply there. Still others will migrate even further within the cat. Regardless of where these end up, though, the cat's immune system will force these specific organisms into a dormant, cystic form.</p><p>Occasionally, though, if a cat's immune system isn't strong enough to fight the organisms that could potentially migrate from the gastrointestinal tract, the cat will begin showing mostly mild clinical signs of the disease.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Fever</h3><p>A cat infected with the parasite may have a fever, which is one of the most common symptoms. Though it's best left to your vet to take your cat's temperature with a thermometer, you can see signs of a fever. Your cat may shiver, feel listless, lose its appetite, and possibly have a rapid heartbeat.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite</h3><p>Another common, but non-specific symptom your cat may show is a lack of appetite. Disinterest in food may accompany trouble breathing. If a cat can't smell its food it is likely to stop eating.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>Any time a cat is ill, it will feel listless, including if it is infected with this parasite.</p><h3>Pneumonia/Breathing Problems</h3><p>If the parasite has migrated into the lungs, your cat may have difficulty breathing. This condition may lead to pneumonia and the breathing will become continually worse. As a result, your cat may have difficulty swallowing while eating.</p><h3>Inflamed Eyes</h3><p>If the parasite is in the ocular area, your cat will show a host of symptoms, from inflammation, abnormal pupil sizes, sensitivity to light, and potential blindness.</p><h3>Liver Problems/Jaundice</h3><p>If the parasite has found a home in your cat's liver, your pet may appear jaundiced, though it may be subtle and difficult to observe. The cat's skin and mucous membranes, including the eyes, ears, and gums may take on a yellowish tinge.</p><h3>Tremors/Seizures</h3><p>When toxoplasmosis affects the central nervous system, your cat may begin to have tremors or seizures. A seizure could be a symptom of another disease so do not ignore this symptom and call your vet immediately.</p><h3>Personality Changes</h3><p>The presence of the parasite may trigger changes in your cat's behavior. Some personality changes may include avoidance of being touched, walking in circles, pressing its head against a surface, constant ear twitching, incontinence, or loss of control of defecation.</p><h2>Causes of Toxoplasmosis</h2><p>Cats become infected by hunting small animals, such as birds and rodents, that are infected with the parasite. Contaminated food, especially from feeding a cat a raw diet, is another route by which your cat can become infected with the parasite.</p><p>When a cat (the definitive host) ingests the organism from an infected intermediate host, the parasite is released from the cysts that were formed in the intermediate host and goes into the cat's gastrointestinal tract. Once this happens, the parasite can begin reproducing by forming oocysts that are shed in the cat's stool. Cats can begin shedding oocysts in as little as three days post-ingestion and can continue to shed them anywhere from one week up to three weeks. Infected cats do not shed oocysts continually, though.</p><p>Furthermore, an oocyst is not immediately infectious upon excretion in a piece of stool. The oocyst must first sporulate (produce spores), a process that can take between one and five days, depending on environmental conditions. Oocysts can also survive a very long time in the environment. Sometimes well over a year, depending on the conditions.</p><h2>Diagnosing Toxoplasmosis in Cats</h2><p>Your veterinarian can use a special blood test to diagnose toxoplasmosis. If your cat tests positive for toxoplasmosis then your cat has been exposed to the parasite at some point in its life but that does not reflect on whether your cat is actively shedding oocysts at that time. If your cat tests negative for toxoplasmosis then your cat has not been exposed to the parasite.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If your cat does start exhibiting signs of toxoplasmosis, it is easily treated with a simple course of antibiotics. If your cat has significant inflammation associated with an infection with the eyes or nervous system, your vet may also prescribe a course of corticosteroids.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Toxoplasmosis</h2><p>The prognosis for a cat that shows symptoms of toxoplasmosis is guarded depending on the damage already done to the organs where the parasites have lived or the systems impacted by the infection. If the infection has affected the lungs or the liver the prognosis may not be favorable.</p><h2>How to Prevent Toxoplasmosis</h2><p>Toxoplasmosis in cats is something that all cat owners should be aware of, but more so if pregnant or immune-suppressed people will come into contact with your pet.</p><h2>Is Toxoplasmosis Contagious to Other Animals</h2><p>Toxoplasmosis can be contagious to other animals but only in a specific way. When an intermediate host becomes infected with the organism replicates and the cysts that develop will collect in various parts of the host animal's body. The host animal will carry these cysts throughout its life. If the host animal is ever consumed, whether by a predator that kills it or a scavenger that consumes it after death, those cysts then infect the animal that eats the host. Any predator, including cats, is at risk of infection by</p><h2>Is Toxoplasmosis Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>Toxoplasmosis can be contagious to humans. Most people that contract won't become sick or symptomatic from the parasite. If you have concerns about contracting from your cat, rest assured that basic good hygiene (washing your hands thoroughly afterward) can prevent you from becoming infected. If you're pregnant, wearing gloves while cleaning the cat box is an added safeguard, or completely avoiding it and letting someone else temporarily take over the task is best.</p>",1159
104,https://www.thesprucepets.com/about-ear-mites-dogs-and-cats-3384667,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Parasites,<h1>Ear Mites in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Ear Mites in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Ear mites are common and highly contagious parasites (although they don't usually affect humans) that can make life miserable for your pet, especially outdoor cats that seem to attract them. They're not usually life-threatening but ear mites can cause infections of an animal's ear canal and sometimes can cause your pet to scratch so much that blood vessels in the ear rupture, which may require surgery.</p><h2>What Are Ear Mites?</h2><p>Ear mites are tiny parasites that live out their life cycles mostly inside the ear canal. They are quite common and can cause severe irritation and itchiness of a cat's ears. The most common ear mite of cats is , and therefore an infestation with ear mites is sometimes called ""otodectic mange.""</p><p>Ear mites primarily live in the ear canal, where they feed on ear wax and skin oils. Their presence causes inflammation, and can also lead to secondary ear infections. Eggs are laid in the ear, and it takes about three weeks for eggs to hatch and develop into adult mites that can reproduce.</p><h2>Symptoms of Ear Mites in Cats</h2><p>It's not difficult to recognize ear mites, based on your pet's behavior and appearance. The mites themselves, however, are generally too small to see with the naked eye.</p><h3>Head Shaking</h3><p>You can tell your cat has ear mites if it's frequently and vigorously shaking its head, along with the other noted symptoms.</p><h3>Scratching at Ears</h3><p>If your cat is constantly and aggressively scratching or rubbing its ears or has redness or hair loss around the ears, check inside for ear discharge. Ear mites are likely living inside the ear. The intense itching sensation your cat may have is also probably due to the feeling of mite droppings inside the ear and on the skin.</p><h3>Ear Discharge</h3><p>Ear mites are so tiny that they're hard to see with the naked eye. A dark waxy or crusty discharge or substance sitting in your cat's ears is the hallmark characteristic of ear mites. The discharge looks a bit like coffee grounds because it is a mixture of ear wax, blood, and secretions from mites.</p><h3>Unusual Amount of Body Scratching</h3><p>While ear mites are generally found in the ears, they can also wander out onto the body, causing irritation and itchiness of the skin as well. Irritation of other parts of the body results in an unusual amount of scratching.</p><h2>Causes of Ear Mites</h2><p>Cats are commonly affected by ear mites, which are spread mostly by direct contact with another animal. They are especially common in young animals. Cats can catch ear mites from other, affected cats, or the environment. Mites are not breed-specific.</p><h2>Diagnosing Ear Mites in Cats</h2><p>The diagnosis of ear mites is confirmed when the mites are found in a sample of the ear discharge examined under a microscope. Sometimes the mites can even be seen as little white specks moving around in the ear (when using a magnifying scope, or otoscope, to examine the ear).</p><p>Confirming the presence of the mites is necessary to distinguish ear mites from other ear infections, such as yeast infections, so don't try to diagnose them at home. Always consult a veterinarian before beginning any course of treatment.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>There are several options for treating ear mites, and your veterinarian will recommend a treatment protocol for your pet. Over-the-counter medications (and DIY treatments) are often less effective or require extended treatment times compared to medications prescribed by your vet. In fact, some newer medications require only a single application to be effective so you can quickly relieve your cat of this annoyance.</p><p>First, thorough cleaning of the ears can help clear the discharge, calm the irritation, and remove some of the mites.</p><p>It is important to strictly follow your vet's recommended dosage schedule for the successful treatment of ear mites. Though more time-consuming to apply, some medications can calm inflammation and treat secondary bacterial or yeast infections.</p><p>Even if they are not showing symptoms, all pets in the home, including dogs, should be treated at the same time.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Ear Mites</h2><p>Untreated cats can experience bacterial infections, damaged ear canals, and potential deafness. Treated cats will typically respond well. However, if your cat has a persistent problem with mites, the skin may become oily, flaky, thickened, and sores may develop that turn crusty or oozy, and may require other treatment from your vet.</p><h2>How to Prevent Ear Mites</h2><p>The best prevention against ear mites is to keep your cat indoors. If your cat is an indoor/outdoor cat, the best defense is to keep your pet's bedding and toys clean, take it for regular vet appointments, and stay aware of your cat's behavior so you can recognize any symptoms.</p><h2>Are Ear Mites Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>Ear mites do not survive for long periods on humans so they do not cause long-term infections in people. Very rarely, however, ear mites may transiently hang out on humans-on arms or extremities-and produce a transient rash.</p><p>Because they're so small, ear mites are typically confirmed by a vet when discharge from your cat's ears is examined under a microscope. That being said, you can sometimes even see the mites as little white specks moving around in your cat's ear if you're looking closely with a magnifying glass. As a pet owner, you will most typically notice the symptoms of ear mites and have their presence confirmed by a vet.</p><p>There are several symptoms to keep an eye out for if you suspect your cat may have ear mites. Look for excessive scratching at the ears or head shaking, which may be your cat's attempt at alleviating discomfort. You may also notice dark waxy or crusty discharge in your cat's ears, which is one of the hallmark signs of ear mites.</p><p>Cats may acquire ear mites for several reasons, but the most common is contact with other infected cats. Ear mites are commonly seen in cats that have spent time in shelters or in close proximity to other infested cats. Likewise, outdoor cats are more likely to become afflicted with ear mites.</p>",989
105,https://www.thesprucepets.com/safely-remove-ticks-from-cats-552086,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Parasites,<h1>Ticks in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Ticks in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Ticks are abundant in wooded and grassy areas where cats like to roam. When a cat passes vegetation where ticks congregate, the parasites climb onto the cat's fur and burrow down to attach to the cat's skin. Blood loss from ticks can be problematic in severe infestations, but the diseases carried by ticks are even more dangerous. Ticks transmit several blood-borne diseases that can cause life-threatening illnesses in both cats and humans. It is essential to remove any ticks you spot on your cat's skin quickly and efficiently to minimize harm to your cat.If you remove the tick within 48 hours of its attachment, the risk of disease transmission from the tick is greatly reduced.</p><h2>What Are Ticks?</h2><p>Ticks are small, eight-legged, oval-shaped arachnids that vary in size from less than a millimeter to about a centimeter long, depending on life stage. Ticks feed on animals' blood by embedding their mouthparts in the hosts' skin. They remain attached until full of blood, then they drop off. The longer ticks stay embedded, the greater the chance they will transmit diseases such as Lyme disease. Ticks are most commonly encountered during the warmer months, from spring to fall.</p><h2>Symptoms of Ticks on Cats</h2><p>Ticks can cause itching, but very often there are no other overt symptoms until and unless your cat develops a tick-borne illness. Thus, the only ""symptom"" you may see is a tick on your cat.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Ticks are often too small to spot easily, and a cat's dense fur makes finding a tick even more difficult. Nymphs (a tick's youngest life stage) are extremely small and hard to see. Run your hands over your cat's body each evening to check for any small bumps. A tick will feel like a small, movable nodule on your cat's skin. They commonly attach themselves to the skin on a cat's head, neck, ears, and feet.</p><h3>Tick-Borne Illnesses in Cats</h3><p>Compared to dogs and humans, tick-borne disease in cats is relatively rare. Cats can get Lyme disease just like dogs and humans, and, if treated early, should fully recover. There is no Lyme disease vaccine for cats.</p><p>Tularemia is another disease that can be transmitted to cats via ticks. Again, there's no vaccine for this disease in felines. High fever and loss of appetite are the most common symptoms in cats. Tularemia is treated with antibiotics.</p><p>Cytauxzoonosis (also called bobcat fever) is another tick-borne illness that affects cats. Symptoms include anemia, fever, jaundice, and difficulty breathing. This is a very serious, potentially fatal infection, and even if a course of antibiotics and intravenous fluids are administered promptly, the cat may still die from cytauxzoonosis. This is another tick-borne illness for which there is no preventive vaccine available to cats.</p><h2>Causes of Ticks</h2><p>Ticks gain access to cats as they move through the outdoor environment, and the parasites quickly migrate through the fur to the skin. There, they pierce the cat's skin and begin feeding on blood. Ticks may remain attached to a cat for several days before they drop off; while attached to the cat, they can transmit microbes that can cause the diseases described above.</p><h2>Diagnosing Ticks in Cats</h2><p>Ticks are easily diagnosed on sight. The diseases they carry are more difficult to diagnose and may require blood tests for identification. Often, tick-borne diseases are diagnosed based on the known presence of a tick and subsequent symptoms of fever, lethargy, and generalized pain.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>In some areas, ticks are very common. If your cat goes outside, it's helpful to keep essential tick-removal supplies on hand, including sharp-nosed tweezers, a small jar of rubbing alcohol, and a disinfectant. To minimize any chance of hurting your pet (or getting scratched yourself), ask a partner to help with restraint.</p> <p>If Lyme disease or other ailments are prevalent in the area, do not throw the tick away or flush it down a drain. Instead, take the tick in a secured container to your veterinarian for testing and identification.</p><p>After removing the tick and treating the affected area, monitor your cat's behavior, appetite, and skin for a few weeks.</p><p>If your cat is lethargic, loses its appetite, or develops welts or rashes near the tick bite, it may have contracted a disease from the tick and will require medical attention right away. Monitoring its condition and getting it to the vet as soon as possible can help minimize the impact of any illness.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Ticks</h2><p>If a tick is removed within 48 hours of attachment, the risk of disease transmission is small, and the cat will suffer little more than an itchy bite, which should heal within a couple of weeks. Cats that contract a tick-borne disease may feel ill for much longer, even with proper treatment, and some will die despite treatment (particularly in cases of cytauxzoonosis).</p><h2>How to Prevent Ticks</h2><p>There are several good ways to prevent ticks on cats. The first is simply to keep your cat indoors; while this is not foolproof, it dramatically reduces the likelihood of ticks.</p><p>While all of these preventatives can be effective, none is guaranteed, and any chemical treatment carries risks of side effects. It's particularly important to be vigilant, particularly if your cat spends a lot of time outdoors.</p><h2>Are Ticks Contagious to Other Animals or People?</h2><p>While ticks aren't contagious, they can migrate from a cat to other species. If a cat brings ticks indoors, they may fall off after feeding, remain in the house, and attach to another pet or human when ready to feed again.</p>",903

These parasitic worms reside in cats' gastrointestinal tracts and can be irritating, but they only cause observable symptoms when the infestation is longstanding and severe. Untreated, roundworms can cause weight loss, dull coat, and vomiting or diarrhea. can also cause health problems in humans.</p><h2>What Are Roundworms?</h2><p>Like hookworms and tapeworms, roundworms are common intestinal parasites in cats and other animals. Two species of roundworms infect cats: and . Both are skinny, round, up to four inches long, and white to pale brown in color (they look similar to spaghetti noodles).</p><p>Roundworm eggs and larvae, ingested from the external environment, migrate through the cat's tissues. They eventually reach the lungs where they cause irritation so that the cat coughs them up and then re-swallows them.</p><p>Upon entering the cat's gastrointestinal tract a second time, the larvae become adult roundworms in the cat's intestines. These produce numerous eggs, which are passed in the feces. Eggs only become infectious after two to four weeks in the environment. The eggs are hardy and can remain infectious for months or even years.</p><p>Sometimes, the larvae stop their bodily migration in the liver, where they enter a dormant state. In a pregnant female cat, these larvae become active again, and the larvae can be secreted in the mother's milk after birth. They can also produce an active adult roundworm infection in the mom's intestines, so she then sheds numerous eggs that can also infect her kittens.</p><h2>Symptoms of Roundworms in Cats</h2> <h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Symptoms of roundworm infestations manifest as a result of the parasites' interference with a cat's assimilation of nutrients and, occasionally, intestinal bleeding. Weight loss, dull coat, and a general failure to thrive occur due to malnutrition rather than the presence of the worms themselves.</p><p>As part of the worms' life cycle, they migrate through the lungs and cause irritation that encourages a cat to cough them up and re-swallow them. ( stay in cats' intestines.) Rarely, very heavy infections of either roundworm species can lead to blockage of the intestines, which will make a cat very ill with vomiting, bloating, and lethargy.</p><h2>Causes of Roundworms in Cats</h2> <h2>Diagnosing Roundworms in Cats</h2><p>Unless roundworms are present in your cat's vomit or stool, they must be diagnosed by a veterinarian. Roundworms eggs are detected under the microscope in a routine check of a stool sample (the test is called fecal flotation). The medical term for infection with roundworms is ascariasis.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Several medications treat roundworms, and your vet can help you pick the one right for your cat. Medications will only affect adult roundworms, however, so they need to be repeated at two to three-week intervals to deal with any residual larvae as they mature. The number of treatments necessary will depend on the age of the cat and the situation, which will be assessed by your vet. If you have a pregnant cat, consult your vet for advice on de-worming both the mom and kittens.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Roundworms</h2><p>Prompt and persistent treatment of a roundworm infestation usually allows a cat to fully recover within a matter of weeks. Heavy or longstanding infestations that have compromised a cat's health are more difficult to treat but are generally successful with proper medication and supportive nutrition to help a cat regain its physical condition.</p><h2>How to Prevent Roundworms</h2><p>Roundworms generally infect kittens and cats who spend time outdoors or who spend time with outdoor cats, so keeping cats inside is a powerful preventative.</p><p>Once roundworm is diagnosed, it's important to follow the vet's instructions carefully to prevent recurrent infestations.</p><p>Many of the monthly prescription medications designed to prevent heartworms and other parasites will also keep roundworms under control. Discuss these options with your vet, and ask about the potential side effects (including seizures) so that you can weigh the risk-to-benefit ratio of using these medications.</p><h2>Types of Roundworms</h2><p>There are two species of roundworms that affect cats. They look and behave similarly, but they have different life cycles.</p><h2>Are Roundworms Contagious to Other Animals?</h2><p>are contagious to other cats and humans but not to dogs. are contagious, both to other felines and other species including humans but their occurrence is much less common.</p><h2>Are Roundworms Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>Roundworms can find their way into people as well as cats ( are more prevalent in both species than ). Infestation happens when eggs are ingested. It is most common in children who may not practice the best hygiene and may pick up eggs on their hands when playing in the yard. Children should wash their hands regularly, and cats should be kept out of areas where children play.</p><p>The larvae don't develop into adult roundworms in people, but the larvae migrating through the tissues can cause inflammation, especially in young children. Most cases are not serious, but in serious cases, organ damage is possible as a result of the migrating larvae (such as the liver, lung, brain), and sometimes the larvae can reach the eyes, leading to visual disturbances and even blindness.</p><p>The migration of roundworm larvae through human tissues is called ""visceral larva migrans,"" while migration to the eyes is called ""ocular larva migrans."" </p><h3>Watch Now: How to Know If Your Cat Is Sick</h3><p>Parasites - Toxocariasis (Also Known as Roundworm Infection).</p><p>Gastrointestinal Parasites Of Cats Brochure.</p><p>Gastrointestinal Parasites Of Cats.</p><p>Roundworms In Small Animals.</p>",871
107,https://www.thesprucepets.com/treating-tapeworms-in-cats-and-dogs-3385262,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Parasites,<h1>Tapeworms in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Tapeworms in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Tapeworms are internal parasites that cats can easily contract and pass on to other animals and people. Fortunately, tapeworms are highly treatable with medication. Tapeworms may cause uncomfortable symptoms like diarrhea, weight loss, and vomiting, and once diagnosed, should be addressed immediately. If untreated, tapeworm symptoms will continue and the worm can live for years in your cat's body, growing in length. The best preventative measure you can take against tapeworms is to protect your cat from fleas. Like other zoonotic diseases, cat owners should take a tapeworm infection seriously and know what to watch for to protect their cat best.</p><h2>What Are Tapeworms?</h2><p>Like a hookworm or roundworm, a tapeworm is an intestinal parasite that attaches to the small intestines of cats, other animals, and humans. Tapeworms are segmented white flatworms that feed off of a cat's food, keeping the cat from absorbing necessary nutrients. A tapeworm uses its hook-like mouth to latch onto the small intestine and can grow up to 8 inches in length. The individual segments in the worm are called proglottids and contain fertilized tapeworm eggs, which will hatch shortly following passage through the anus.</p><h2>Symptoms of Tapeworms in Cats</h2><p>Like other intestinal parasites, tapeworms may be seen in a cat's feces and cause gastrointestinal upset. Pay careful attention to your cat's symptoms to help distinguish between types of worms, and take your cat to the vet if you suspect that your cat has a parasite.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Worm Segments</h3><p>The presence of small rice-sized segments around the anal opening is the most common indicator of a tapeworm infestation. These little segments, called proglottids, may be stuck in your cat's fur or crawling around on your cat's hind end.</p><h3>Scooting and Licking</h3><p>Sometimes worm segments irritate a cat's hind end, so your cat may also scoot or lick its rear to scratch the itch.</p><h3>Diarrhea and Vomiting</h3><p>An infestation of tapeworms can also cause vomiting and diarrhea. Since tapeworms live in the digestive tract, they may also exit the body through vomit or diarrhea.</p><h3>Worms in Vomit and Stool</h3><p>Worms might be crawling around on your cat's feces or the ground near where your cat is sleeping. Longer worm segments are more likely to appear in liquid excretions like vomit and diarrhea.</p><h3>Weight Loss</h3><p>Weight loss is another potential sign that your cat has tapeworms. Since tapeworms feed off what a cat eats, the cat will lose weight over time, even though it is eating just as much as it used to eat, if not more. Tapeworms are not a safe way for a cat, or any other species, to lose weight because the parasite will also cause vitamin and mineral deficiencies.</p><h2>Causes of Tapeworms</h2><p>There is only one way a cat can get the most common species of tapeworms, but less common species can be transmitted in other ways. </p><h2>Diagnosing Tapeworms in Cats</h2><p>Seeing the tapeworm or its proglottids is usually a reliable way to diagnose a cat with tapeworms. Still, your veterinarian may also confirm the parasite by using a microscope. When crushed, the proglottids will expel tiny egg packets that make clear your cat has tapeworms.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Cats diagnosed with tapeworms will need specific medications to kill the parasites. These medications may be administered by injection, topically, or orally and will dissolve the worm in the intestine. Your veterinarian will recommend the drug best suited for your cat.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Tapeworms</h2><p>When treated early and correctly, the prognosis for cats with tapeworms is good. With proper care, you can permanently eradicate tapeworms. Extra precautions are necessary if your cat is recovering from fleas and tapeworm at the same time. You will need to thoroughly wash all of your cat's toys and bedding and change your cat's litter daily.</p><h2>How to Prevent Tapeworms</h2><p>The best way to keep your cat from getting tapeworms is to prevent fleas. Even if your cat never leaves the house, you should use regular flea preventatives year-round. Insects, including fleas, can get into your home, and the pupal stage of the flea can live in the environment for up to two years before it hatches into a larva and grows into an adult flea. This means fleas could be hiding in your home, waiting for your cats to skip their flea preventatives.</p><h2>Is It Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>Tapeworms are zoonotic, meaning humans can get them from animals, but contracting tapeworms requires ingestion of a flea or consumption of the eggs from the feces. This is rare but not impossible if good hygiene is not practiced.</p><p>Tapeworms are long, white, and flat. A fully developed tapeworm can become very long, but it's normal to notice the worm as small rice-sized segments around the anal opening.</p><p>If your cat has the most common strain of tapeworm, dipylidium caninum,it is because they have eaten a flea. Your cat can also get tapeworm from eating small rodents.</p><p>Tapeworms in cats are curable. With proper treatment, they can be rid entirely of the cat's digestive system. Consult with your vet for the right treatment plan for your cat.</p>",822
108,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mange-in-cats-4583792,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>Everything you need to know about Mange in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Everything you need to know about Mange in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Mange is a skin disease caused by parasitic mites, which are very tiny arachnids related to spiders and ticks. It is more common in dogs than cats, but there are several different types of mange that can affect felines. Some types of feline mange are also contagious to humans as well as dogs and many other mammals. This unpleasant condition causes extreme itching, damage to the skin, and hair loss in the affected areas.</p><p>Both indoor and outdoor cats of any age are at risk for getting these external parasites, but there are things you can do to minimize their chances of infection. Knowing how to treat and prevent mange infestations in cats can help keep your feline comfortable.</p><h2>What Is Mange?</h2><p>Mange is a skin disease caused by an infestation of mites, which are very tiny parasitic arachnids with eight legs attached to a round body. Some types of mange mites are too small to be seen with the naked eye, while others look like tiny black or white dots. Depending on the type of mange mite, these pests may live off ear wax, bite the surface of the skin, or burrow into your cat's skin. All types of mite infestations cause discomfort and severe itch.</p><h2>Types of Mange in Cats</h2><p>There are several types of mites that cause mange in cats. The most common are scabies, demodex, ear mites, and walking dandruff, but trombiculosis also occasionally infects cats.</p><h3>Scabies</h3><p>Scabies is usually caused by (sarcoptic mange) but can rarely be caused by (notoedric mange) mites. Scabies is highly contagious not only to cats but also to dogs and humans. The female scabies mite burrows into the host's skin and lays eggs just underneath the surface, causing an extremely itchy rash.</p><h3>Demodicosis</h3><p>An infestation of demodex mange mites is called demodicosis, which can infect cats and dogs. Both and mites can cause demodicosis. is thought to be a normal resident of a healthy cat's skin but can cause demodicosis in an unhealthy cat or a cat with a weak immune system. is a very contagious type of demodex and is more likely to be found on young cats. Demodicosis leads to hair loss, along with crusted, inflamed patches of skin.</p><h3>Trombiculosis</h3><p>Cats get trombiculosis from mange mites in the family. In their larval stage, these mites are often called chiggers. The larval mite attaches to the skin and fur of its host, which can be a cat, dog, or human, along with many other warm-blooded animals. Chiggers are most common in the summer and autumn months. Contrary to common misconceptions, chiggers do not burrow underneath an animal's skin, but bite and inject digestive enzymes into the skin, leading to reddened, inflamed bumps or blisters.</p><h2>Symptoms of Mange in Cats</h2><p>Excessive itching, hair loss, and redness are the most common symptoms of mange mites in a cat. Skin crusting and small skin bumps may also be seen in some cats with mange. If the mange is located in the ears of a cat, a cat will also have excessive ear debris that is dry and dark when compared to normal ear wax. When mange is severe, there can be a foul odor to the infected areas, as well.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Itching</h3><p>Mange of all types is an intensely itchy condition. Your cat will scratch frequently and intensely at the infected areas, and often will also bite and lick the areas as well in an attempt to gain relief. The scratching can lead to further skin inflammation and irritation, along with secondary bacterial infections.</p><h3>Hair Loss</h3><p>Most types of mange cause inflammation in the skin and hair follicles, which leads to patchy bald spots in the areas of infection as hair falls out of the damaged follicles. The intense scratching caused by mange also damages and loosens hairs, furthering the hair loss. Fortunately, the fur generally grows back once the mange is treated.</p><h3>Skin Bumps</h3><p>Most forms of mange cause a rash on the host's skin, usually in the form of small, reddened bumps or blisters. Scratching the itchy rash can damage the skin further, and lead to secondary bacterial infection.</p><h3>Skin Crusts</h3><p>Whitish, yellowish, or grayish crusts over the inflamed areas are very common with mange. If untreated, the crusts can thicken, giving the affected skin a wrinkled, leathery appearance.</p><h3>Reddened Skin</h3><p>Skin inflamed by mange typically becomes pink or red, particularly in the areas your cat scratches the most.</p><h3>Ear Debris</h3><p>If your cat has ear mites, you'll typically spot black, red, or yellow debris in the ear canals, often in clumps sticking to the skin or hair. Your cat will shake its head, scratch at its ears, or attempt to paw at them in an effort to relieve the itch.</p><h2>Causes of Mange</h2><p>Most mange mites are contagious, so they are easily spread if your cat interacts closely with an infected cat, or even with bedding that an infected cat used. Some mites are also found in the environment and can hitch a ride on your cat if it roams outdoors. Other mites, like demodex mites, are naturally present on your cat and only cause issues if your cat's immune system is compromised. Generally, mange is far more common on cats that spend time outdoors and fairly rare on cats that are indoor-only. Mange is most common in feral cats that congregate in colonies. Still, any cat is potentially at risk for this itchy skin condition.</p><h2>Diagnosing Mange in Cats</h2><p>If you suspect your cat has mange, your veterinarian will perform a full physical examination of your cat and take some small scrapings of the skin, fur, or ear debris depending on the affected area. They will examine these samples under the microscope or with a magnifying glass to look for the mange mites or mite eggs. Your veterinarian may also want to draw blood and run tests to look for underlying diseases that might have led to a weakened immune system, thus making your cat more susceptible to mange. Diabetes, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and feline leukemia virus (FeLV) are some of the diseases that can weaken a cat's immune system.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>With treatment, mange is quite curable, although it can take persistence and patience to eliminate all of the mites and their eggs. Various anti-parasitic drugs are used to kill mange mites. Depending on the type of mite and the severity and location of the infestation, your veterinarian will recommend either a topical, oral, or injectable medication, although topically applied gels, liquids, and ointments are most common.</p><p>Some of the most-prescribed topical medications for mange include ivermectin, selamectin, and fipronil. Medicated dips or baths are also sometimes prescribed. Generally, these treatments are applied weekly for several weeks until your pet tests clear of mites and mite eggs.</p><p>Medicated ear drops are the treatment for ear mites. These are typically applied once or twice a day for several days until all signs of mites are gone.</p><p>If you have other pets in the home, your veterinarian might recommend that all of them be treated, even those not showing signs of mange, to ward off the spread of the mites.</p><h2>How to Prevent Mange</h2><p>Some topical treatments used to prevent flea and tick infestations also work to kill various types of mange mites. If your cat must go outdoors, ask your veterinarian if they recommend selamectin (Revolution), moxidectin (Advantage Multi), sarolaner (Revolution Plus), or fluralaner (Bravecto) for preventing mange mites in your cat. These same drugs may also help protect your cat against fleas, heartworms, ticks, and intestinal parasites.</p>",1234
109,https://www.thesprucepets.com/holiday-safety-for-cats-4154543,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>10 Holiday Safety Tips for Cats</h1>,"<h1>10 Holiday Safety Tips for Cats</h1><p>You may be eager to get your home ready for the holiday season, but are your plans cat-friendly? The sights, scents and sounds of the holiday season can be tempting to our curious felines. Cats love to explore novel objects in the environment, especially those that are shiny or stringy. They may be attracted to the smells of holiday meals cooking or scared by the sounds of parties and events.</p><p>Kittens and young or playful cats are at the greatest risk of injury due to holiday decorations. Senior cats may be more prone to stress-induced illness when there is too much chaos going on in your home. Fortunately, you can still enjoy holiday celebrations while protecting your cat. Follow these tips to keep your cat safe from holiday dangers.</p><h2>Christmas Trees</h2><p>Imagine your cat's excitement when he or she sees a huge tree covered in what looks like cat toys. Unfortunately, Christmas trees can be dangerous to cats.</p><p>Keep fragile ornaments and dangerous decorations out of reach when decorating your tree. If your cat still can't seem to resist the tree, you may need to keep your cat away from this area when you are not home. Consider putting up the Christmas tree in a room that can easily be closed off.</p><h2>Ribbons and Tinsel</h2><p>Many cats are unable to resist something shiny or sparkly. Tons of cats go nuts for strings and ribbons. It's only natural that your cat will want to play with decorations and gift wrap accessories like ribbons, bows, string, tinsel, etc. The danger in this is that string-like materials can cause a dangerous linear foreign body obstruction that requires surgery.</p><p>Avoid using loose tinsel or other string-like materials and opt for safer items. You can decorate gifts with paper bows or thicker cloth ribbons. Use garland made from beads or thick cloth ribbons to decorate your tree and home. The tinsel garland that does not contain long strings may be safe, but hang it out of reach just to be safe.</p><h2>Flowers and Plants</h2><p>Holiday plants and flowers can look nice in your home, but they can also attract a curious feline. At the very least, your cat may cause damage by chewing leaves, knocking over pots or vases, or even using the soil as a litter box! Unfortunately, nibbling plants and flowers could send your cat to the emergency vet.</p><p>Poinsettias are known for their toxicity to cats, but they tend to have only mildly toxic effects. Holly and mistletoe are more dangerous if ingested. Flowers such as lilies and amaryllis are especially dangerous. It's best to completely keep toxic plants and flowers out of your home. Choose non-toxic plants or use silk flowers instead.</p><h2>Candles and Fireplaces</h2><p>The warmth of a candle or fireplace is like a dream come true for most cats. However, some cats (especially kittens) may get too close to stay safe. Your cat may singe her whiskers if she explores too closely. Your cat can also knock over a candle and cause a fire.</p><p>Always keep candles out of reach of your cat. Never leave candles or fireplaces burning unsupervised. Use a fireplace shield/guard to prevent your cat from getting too close to the flames or metal parts of the hearth that can burn tender paws.</p><h2>Electrical Cords</h2><p>To your cat, an extension cord might look like just another string to play with. String lights may be even more tempting since they sparkle. If your cat tries to play with or chew on electrical cords, she could end up getting burned or electrocuted. Hang lights out of reach of your cat and secure loose cords so they don't dangle or slide on the floor.</p><h2>Human Food</h2><p>The aroma of holiday cooking can attract cats, especially if you are making a juicy roast. You may want to give your cat an extra treat during the holidays, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. Just make sure to avoid foods that can make your cat sick. Most cats are not interested in eating toxic foods like onions, chocolate, and avocados. However, they may crave a dish that contains these ingredients. Also, your cat can develop vomiting or diarrhea after consuming rich, fatty foods. High sodium foods can cause health problems as well. Dairy products may cause diarrhea (vets estimate that about half of cats are lactose intolerant).</p><p>While it's okay to offer a little sliver of lean meat, avoid letting your cat feast on the pan drippings, drink the gravy or eat the whipped cream off your leftover pie. Make sure treats make up no more than 10 percent of your cat's daily food intake.</p> <h2>Dressing Up</h2><p>There's no arguing that cats look adorable when they are dressed up in cute little outfits. Santa hats, elf costumes, sweaters and knit caps all look irresistibly cute on cats. Unfortunately, your cat may not see things the same way. Many cats despise wearing clothing or accessories, especially on their heads.</p><p>Before you start dressing up your cat this holiday season, make sure you are not creating unnecessary stress. The holiday season can be hectic enough for your cat. Why make things worse by torturing her with those reindeer antlers?</p><h2>Houseguests, Noise, and Chaos</h2><p>The holiday season is festive and filled with music and chatter. Many people have parties or small get-togethers with friends and family. There may even be singing and dancing. New Year's Eve has fireworks. All this may seem like fun to you, but what does your cat think?</p><p>Cats are highly sensitive to noise. Many are shy or nervous around strangers. The general chaos of the holiday season can stress out your cat. Make sure you provide a safe, comfortable place for your cat to hide. Ask guests not to leave doors open so your cat won't get out. Better yet, close your cat in a comfortable room with soft beds, food, water, and a litter box. Make sure guests know the room is off-limits.</p><h2>Travel Plans</h2><p>Will you travel during the holidays? If so, what is the plan for your cat? If your cat is not accustomed to traveling, it's probably best to leave her behind. Or, take steps to get your cat used to car travel. You may be able to fly with your cat, but most owners avoid this unless the trip is long-term.</p><p>If your cat isn't coming with you, decide where she will stay. A boarding facility is one option, but this is also something most cats dislike. Your cat wants to be at home with you, so being home alone is the next best option.</p><p>Consider finding a pet sitter who will visit the house at least twice a day to put out fresh food and water and scoop the litter boxes. Many pet sitters will stick around for a little in case your cat wants some lap time or playtime. Your pet sitter may even text you daily pictures of your cat while you are away.</p><h2>Cats as Gifts</h2><p>Giving someone a cat or kitten as a gift may seem like a sweet gesture, but it's a bad idea. Cats given to children may be forgotten once the holiday season passes and the novelty wears off. Giving a cat to an adult is asking quite a lot. Are you sure the person wants to take on the responsibility of cat ownership? What if the person wanted to choose their cat?</p> ",1212
110,https://www.thesprucepets.com/top-mistakes-of-cat-owners-555300,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>How to Avoid 9 Common Cat Owner Mistakes</h1>,"<h1>How to Avoid 9 Common Cat Owner Mistakes</h1><p>Bringing home a new feline friend is a major decision. Even though cats have earned a reputation for being more independent than their canine counterparts, they still require a great deal of time, effort, and money. So before you head to that local pet store and bring home the first adorable kitten you see (no matter how tempting it is), here are some things potential cat owners should know to avoid the common mistakes often made by new cat owners.</p><h2>Do Your Homework</h2><p>It 's one thing to impulse buy a new pair of jeans, but when it comes to animals, there 's no easy return policy if it 's just not the right fit. When you 're considering bringing home a new feline friend to join your family, you have to consider all of your options and make an educated, informed decision.</p><p>Be sure to do your homework when it comes to cat breeds, behavior, and the basics of their care. You 'll also want to visit different shelters and be sure to ask tons of questions. Because cats are such individual creatures, try to gather as much information as you can about the unique personality and history of your new cat.</p><h2>Understand the Commitment</h2><p>Everyone knows that having kids is not only expensive but also is a life-changing and long-term commitment, and bringing home a new four-legged family member is no different. Responsible shelters will conduct a thorough investigation of any potential adopters to ensure that their home and lifestyle is conducive to cat ownership and that they are also financially capable of providing everything that their new kitty will need to live a happy, healthy life, from necessities such as food to the financial ability to address health conditions that may arise as your pet ages. Keep in mind that there is pet insurance to help make cat ownership more affordable.</p><h2>Be Sure to Spay or Neuter</h2><p>As a cat owner, it 's your responsibility to ensure that your pet is spayed or neutered and to do your part to help address the cat overpopulation issue. Spaying or neutering will help prevent issues such as aggressive behavior in your male cat or yowling in female cats when they 're in heat-but, most importantly, it will eliminate the risk of ending up with a surprise litter of unwanted kittens that will be costly and time-consuming to care for and adopt out. Spaying or neutering your cat also helps protect them from numerous health issues, ranging from cancerous tumors to bacterial infections.</p><h2>Don't Declaw Unless It's Medically Necessary</h2><p>When you bring in your cat to be spayed or neutered, your veterinarian may ask if you 'd like to declaw your cat at the same time. While there are still veterinarians who consider this surgery a routine art of cat ownership, many consider it inhumane and unnecessary, and it is even banned in many countries and U.S. states. The American Veterinary Medical Foundation discourages declawing as an elective procedure and supports non-surgical alternatives. As a cat owner, be sure to do your research to determine where you stand and make an informed decision, as cat declawing requires the surgical amputation of the end bones in your cat 's toes and not just a trim of its nails.</p><h2>Build a Relationship With Your Vet</h2><p>There 's a common misconception that cats don 't need to go to the vet as often as dogs, or that they don 't need to be vaccinated because many cats rarely leave the confines of their house. However, cats must receive the same care as dogs; some vaccines are necessary for all cats, regardless of whether they are indoor or outdoor cats. And it 's just as important that they have access to annual examinations to help catch any problems that could result in more serious health issues. And it probably goes without saying, but your cat should always be seen by your vet if it becomes sick or injured. Be sure to research veterinarians in your area, ask lots of questions, and find the right vet to partner with to help ensure your kitty lives a long, healthy life.</p><h2>Know Proper Litter Box Maintenance</h2><p>As long as you keep your cat 's litter box clean and choose a litter that doesn 't irritate them (stay away from the scented litter, for example), most cats are more than happy to consistently use their litter box. Maintenance will include scooping, scrubbing, and litter replacement. Your cat 's litter box habits can also alert you to any potential health problems; cats that suddenly start urinating outside of their litter box, for example, can be a clue that they may be dealing with a urinary tract issue and need an immediate visit to the vet.</p><h2>Choose the Right Food</h2><p>Pet owners have no shortage of options when it comes to their cat 's food, and the prices run the gamut. However, you 'll want to be sure to feed your cat a food that meets their nutritional needs, such as foods that are a rich source of meat protein and without large amounts of grain fillers such as corn, which is often found in some lesser-quality (and cheaper) cat foods. Discuss with your vet to determine recommended foods for your cat and choose the option that best meets both your cat 's needs and your budget. Keep in mind that in the long run, providing your cat with a higher-quality food may mean fewer visits to the vet and more money in your wallet. All pet foods that carry an AAFCO-approved nutritional guarantee are considered to be nutritionally complete and balanced.</p><h2>Know Where Your Cat Is</h2><p>Whether you choose an indoor or outdoor (or both) lifestyle for your cat, you mustn 't just allow your cat to roam free outdoors. While many cat owners feel their cat deserves the freedom and fresh air, the unfortunate reality is that there are numerous dangers outdoors, from attacks by wild animals (or your neighbor 's dog) to getting hit by a car, so allowing your cat to roam free is not the first choice. In addition, cats that are allowed outdoors are the number one human caused threat to birds and are responsible for killing billions of local wildlife a year which has even contributed to extinction of some bird species. Even one indoor/outdoor cat in a neighborhood can have huge ramifications for local wildlife as even well fed cats still hunt for prey.</p><h2>Understand Basic Cat Behavior</h2><p>Sometimes new cat owners will expect their new four-legged friend to greet them at the door or snuggle with them just like a dog would. They may also become frustrated by typical feline behaviors that humans don 't always fully understand, such as their penchant for seeking out high or enclosed places to observe you instead of curling in your lap on the couch. But as a new cat owner, you 'll need to understand that cats are individualistic creatures with strong instincts. It may take time for them to warm up to you and adjust to your lifestyle, as well as for you to adapt to their unique personalities and behaviors. A cat can offer years of love and companionship, but only if you 're willing to put in the time and effort into building a relationship with them on their terms and understand when your cat is just being a cat</p>",1227

However, you can try spreading cedar chips around your cat 's bedding or outdoors in your garden. You can also apply cedar oil spray on your cat 's fur, as it is a safe, non-toxic essential oil, or even your cat 's collar to help keep the bugs at bay.</p><h2>Lemons</h2><p>One of the most effective natural flea killers is citric acid, which makes lemon juice a widely-recognized home remedy for treating fleas. You can spray your cat 's coat with a solution made by boiling a cut lemon or two (let the lemons steep for a few hours) and then draining the liquid before transferring it to a spray bottle. Work the solution gently into your car 's fur-just be sure to avoid his or her eyes and monitor your pet for redness or other signs of irritation-and repeat the treatment as often as needed until the fleas are gone entirely.</p><p>If your cat hates water-as most cats do-you can also try using a comb dipped into the solution and brushing the fleas out. If you 're concerned about any leftover fleas and flea eggs, add a cup of lemon juice to your laundry while washing your pet 's bedding to help exterminate any remaining bugs.</p><h2>Spices</h2><p>One of the easiest things you can do for a flea-infested cat is to spice up their life with natural ingredients you might find in your kitchen. Because of a natural compound known as carvacrol, oregano oil can be very effective at removing fleas; start by mixing one teaspoon of oregano oil with three teaspoons of olive oil and apply small amounts of the solution to areas where fleas tend to congregate, like your cat 's ears, stomach, tail, and neck. Fleas also don 't particularly care for rosemary; try grinding the leaves into a powder and sprinkling it in the areas where your cat tends to hang out in your home.</p><p>If your cat won 't allow you to apply topical treatments to his or her fur, you can try mixing a small amount (less than a teaspoon) of cumin into your cat 's food. The spice will make your cat 's skin become very unappetizing to fleas.</p><p>If you don 't have any of these spices on hand, a little bit of table salt can also do the trick, as it helps dehydrate and kill the fleas on your cat. Better yet, it works to kill fleas and flea eggs that may be lurking on your carpet (just sprinkle it on), or when mixed with water, it can be used to treat hard surfaces.</p><h2>Apple Cider Vinegar</h2><p>Another grocery store product that fleas don 't particularly enjoy is apple cider vinegar. While it 's not effective at killing the bugs, apple cider vinegar can cause fleas to jump from your cat 's body so that you can better tackle the issue, making it a great first attack in your personal war against fleas. Try mixing the apple cider vinegar with water in a 2:1 ratio and spraying it onto your cat 's coat. Fleas can be a stubborn bunch, so you may have to undergo a few home treatments by applying the vinegar to your cat 's fur in order to become completely flea-free.</p><p>You 'll also want to be sure to vacuum all floors and upholstery (and immediately dispose of the vacuum cleaner bag), wash all bedding in hot water, and consider removing pet food bowls, bird feeders, garbage cans, and any other sources of food from your yard so as to not attract wildlife who can re-infect your pet.</p><h2>Dish Soap</h2><p>Believe it or not, even the most gentle formulations of dish soap have proven to be very effective at exterminating fleas. The dish soap breaks down the flea 's exoskeleton and kills them within minutes, even after it 's been diluted in water. Simply wet your cat 's coat-a spray bottle will do the trick- and gently lather the dish soap into his or her fur (focusing on areas that fleas tend to hide) before rinsing.</p><p>To use dish soap to trap and kill fleas that have made your home their permanent residence, you can try filling a shallow dish with warm, soapy water and placing it close to a source of light. They 'll be drawn towards the light and drown in the liquid.</p><h2>Lavender and Chamomile</h2><p>A gentle way to soothe your pet 's skin-and maybe even help the cat take a little nap-lavender is actually a powerful, fast-acting agent against fleas. In fact, some studies have shown that formulas containing diluted lavender were just as effective at killing fleas as commercial chemical sprays. To put lavender to good use in your home, let fresh lavender steep in water overnight before straining the liquid and spraying it onto your cat 's coat (no need to rinse).</p><p>Another compound that 's known for soothing the skin, loose chamomile tea can also be used to attack fleas on your feline friend. Simply steep the tea and, after it 's fully cooled, apply the liquid to your cat 's coat. You can repeat both treatments daily for as long as needed.</p><p>Fleas appear as small bugs that are black or brown in appearance (and can sometimes be seen jumping) or tiny black specks in the cat's fur. The black specks are commonly called ""flea dirt,"" which is actually flea excrement.</p><p>On many pets, fleas like to hide in areas that are warm and ""protected,"" like the groin, ears, folds of the neck, or armpits. These are the first places you should check, though if your cat has a particularly bad infestation, there's a good chance fleas will be present (and obvious) all over their body.</p><p>Fleas are very tiny-less than 1/8-inch long-and may be difficult to see on your cat, especially if they have dark brown or black fur. It's a good idea to use a strong flashlight when looking for fleas in your cat's fur.</p><p>To determine whether your cat has fleas, you should comb gently through their fur to look for scurrying fleas or signs of flea excrement. You can use your fingers to part and look through your cat's fur, or invest in a flea comb which will be helpful for cats with thicker fur.</p>",1165

They require the same loving care as dogs, pet birds, and exotic pets. All adult cats should be seen by their veterinarian at least once a year for a routine wellness examination. This annual check-up draws a baseline of the cat's normal physical condition, which lets the vet easily spot differences in the cat's condition should illness or emergencies arise.</p><p>However, many cat owners do not take their cats to the vet annually. This is especially true for indoor-only cats and the reasons for skipping the check-up vary greatly. Your cat's health needs to get them in regularly. There are ways to overcome the most common obstacles and it's good to know what you can expect at the vet.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p>Many cat owners are hesitant to take their cat to the vet because they are financially strapped and simply can't afford routine veterinary care. If this is the case, talk to the vet about payment options or only giving your cat basic exam services. Also, keep in mind that preventing health problems can end up saving you money in the long-term.</p><p>Sometimes it's the cat that is the issue. Some cats are either too fearful, stressed, or aggressive when it's ""cage time,"" so their owners delay vet visits. You might want to try a different carrier or a softer approach to getting your cat ready for the trip to the vet.</p><p>For instance, rather than being anxious about it because you know your cat is going to freak out, approach the experience calmly and with lots of treats and soothing caresses. Your cat will pick up on your more relaxed attitude and may be more willing to go without a fight. Be sure to maintain this calmness through the entire trip to the vet.</p><h2>What You Need</h2><p>Ensuring you have everything you need ahead of time will help reduce your stress, which can ease your cat's anxiety as well. Be prepared and get these things ready the night before your scheduled appointment so you're not rushing around.</p><h2>Help With Basic Vitals</h2><p>When you first go in for the exam, vet tech or assistant will typically weigh your cat. Some veterinary clinics even have a scale built into the examination table or a portable one they bring in for smaller animals. Next, the vet tech will take your cat's temperature with a rectal thermometer. You may be asked to assist with this by holding your cat's front end steady.</p><h2>Provide Health History for the Physical Exam</h2><p>The veterinarian will then come in and manually examine your cat's key body parts: the eyes and nose, mouth and teeth, ears, heart and lungs, fur, paws and feet, and rear end. This is a good time to bring up any health concerns you have as well as behavioral issues you're dealing with. Keep in mind that cats often act out when they're not feeling well, so it's good to eliminate potential medical causes whenever your cat starts acting abnormally.</p><p>Your cat's eyes will be checked for clearness and signs of inflammation or tearing, while the nostrils will be looked at for signs of congestion. The vet will examine your cat's mouth and teeth for gum inflammation, signs of excess tartar, and any tooth abnormalities or breakage. Next, your vet will look at your cat's ears for signs of inflammation, redness, or drainage around the ear canal, along with mites.</p><p>Listening to your cat's heart and lungs allows your vet to find any heart murmurs or abnormal sounds, such as respiratory congestion. Then, your vet will comb the cat's fur with a flea comb, looking for signs of ""flea dirt."" Examining the paws and feet also allows your vet to look for broken or damaged claws, cuts, or injury to the pads. Then, the anus will be checked for visual evidence of worms, and the anal gland will be looked at for potential signs of infection or impaction.</p><p>Lastly, your veterinarian will carefully palpate fingers into your cat's internal organs to feel for signs of abnormalities, such as swelling, lumps, or bumps. This is one of the most important parts of the wellness check, as your vet's fingers have the magical ability to remember how a particular cat feels normally. This makes it easy to pinpoint potential problems at future visits.</p><h2>Expect Laboratory Tests</h2><p>If this is your cat's first vet visit as an adult, your veterinarian will likely run a series of lab tests. These tests will establish a ""baseline"" of your cat's normal health and make it easier to spot changes during the cat's next vet appointment.</p><h2>Soothe Your Cat for Core Vaccines</h2><p>You cat will also need to get all recommended vaccinations up to date. Vets and their assistants are typically very good at distracting animals while giving the injections, so your cat may not even notice the needle pricks. You may also be asked to help hold your cat, which is when a gentle touch and calm voice can come in handy.</p><p>Even housecats can escape outside where they'll be exposed to potential dangers. And, if you have other animals in the house, they can pass things to one another, so vaccinations are important.</p><h2>Follow Recommendations</h2><p>After your appointment, your veterinarian will discuss findings from the physical examination and give you medications such as worming medicine, when indicated. You will also receive the results of the lab tests, usually by phone a few days later, along with any necessary follow-up appointments.</p><h2>Preventing Problems During Exam</h2><p>If your cat cowers at the site of its carrier, let it get used to the object before it's time to go to the vet. Set the carrier out on the floor with the door open and place a few treats inside. Don't force your cat to go in. Instead, allow it to explore the carrier on its own.</p><p>The car ride can be one of the most stressful parts of your cat's trip to the vet. To keep kitty as calm as possible, place the carrier in the car right before you're ready to leave. Plenty of treats, a blanket, or some catnip may help comfort your cat during the trip as well.</p><p>Be sure to ask your vet any questions that you have, even if they come up a few weeks later. You won't necessarily have to go back to the office as many questions can be answered over the phone. A good relationship with your pet's vet is good for your cat's health and they will be there to help you throughout kitty's entire life.</p><p>Don't rely on the internet for a diagnosis of any health problems as an alternative to vet care. While it's good to be informed, only your vet knows your cat's history and can give you an accurate diagnosis.</p>",1126
113,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-of-a-health-cat-555013,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>How to Thoroughly Head Check Your Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Thoroughly Head Check Your Cat</h1><p>If you are a cat owner, you want him or her to be healthy. Knowing what a healthy cat looks, feels, and even smells like can help spot any changes that may require veterinary attention. Examining your healthy cat from head to toe helps establish a baseline. It is important first to point out that a ""disability"" such as an amputated limb, blindness, or hearing loss does not automatically rule out being overall healthy. For example, an active blind cat may be much healthier than an obese cat with excellent vision. A thorough check of your cat's head (and all the elements on the head) is a good place to begin.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p>You'll want your cat in a relaxed state to begin your at-home exam. A healthy, observant cat's head will usually give an impression of alertness. Except under particular circumstances (when sleeping or on the prowl, for example) the head will be carried high.</p><p>What You Need</p><p>No tools are necessary, but it might be helpful to keep notes along with the date of the exam. In case you do discover something, you'll have some record of when it may have begun.</p><h2>Check the Skin for Abnormalities</h2><p>Run your hands over your cat's head, along the jaw line and cheeks, and around the neck. Get to know what all the lumps and bumps on your cat's head are in a healthy state. Ruffle up the fur so you can check the skin for scabs, redness, fleas, etc. If you feel or see anything new or unusual, consult with your veterinarian.</p><h2>Examine Your Cat's Ears</h2><p>Except for the Scottish fold and the American Curl, a cat's ears will be triangular in shape. The outside ear coat is very short, and, as a rule, somewhat sparser than the hair on the rest of the cat's body. Because of this, white cats and other cats with light-colored ears are susceptible to squamous cell carcinoma, a form of cancer which tends to attack the ear tips and pink noses of these cats. Any indication of sores or scabs, or a ""crusty"" appearance, that fails to heal normally should trigger a visit to your veterinarian.</p><p>The ears should be clean, with no signs of ear mites, abnormal masses, or infection. Although a cat's ears may normally show a small amount of wax, there should be no foul odor or visible pus or drainage, which could lead to hearing loss. A cat with healthy ears shouldn't shake its head nor paw at its ears. Any of these signs are a red flag that the cat should be seen immediately by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Look at Your Cat's Eyes</h2><h2>Check Your Cat's Nose</h2><p>A healthy cat's sense of smell is much stronger than a human's, which is not surprising, since the cat's nose may be one of its most valuable assets. Cats depend heavily on the sense of smell to locate food in the form of prey, scent out enemies (predators, dogs, other cats), or scout for a mate. Cats use their own scent glands to mark their territory, which may range for several miles in the wild. They use their vomeronasal (Jacobson's) organ within the nose, to identify pheromones -- chemical substances important for communication between individuals.</p><p>A cat's nose skin may be of any color, including black and pink, or even a combination of colors. You might notice some black spots called on the nose and face. These are usually normal but consult with your veterinarian if they grow or change rapidly.</p><p>The nostrils should be free of mucus, and not ""runny."" Although a cat may sometimes sneeze because of allergies or dust, continuous, severe sneezing may be an indication that they have a foreign body embedded in a nasal passage, a nasal tumor, nasal mites, or another potentially serious health problem. So is a cat pawing at its nose? This is more common with cats allowed outdoors, who may have inhaled a foxtail or sharp blade of grass. This requires immediate veterinary attention.</p><h2>Give Your Cat a Dental Exam</h2><p>Like its nose, a healthy cat's mouth and lips may be pink or black. Sometimes as cats age, their previously pink lips may develop black pigment spots, which is normal. The normal color of a healthy cat's gums and the roof of the mouth is a ""bubblegum"" pink. Very pale gums or dark pink to red, irritated gums, especially in tandem with other symptoms, should be checked by a veterinarian at once.</p><p>As an obligate carnivore, cats' teeth are designed not only to kill prey but to tear and shred its flesh for swallowing. Cat teeth are also an important defensive weapon.</p><p>A cat's teeth are normally white, with little, if any, tartar buildup. They are rooted securely in the cat's jawbone. Any signs of redness in the gums around the teeth or loosening of teeth should be investigated by a veterinarian. Following a regular dental care plan will help ensure healthy teeth and gums.</p><h2>Locate All of Your Cat's Whiskers</h2><p>Although the long whiskers above the upper lips on each side of the nostrils are the ones we commonly think of as whiskers, cats also have whiskers above the eyebrows, way back on the cheeks, and shorter ones on the backs of the front legs.</p><p>These extra strong hairs are called , or tactile hairs, and they are at least twice as thick as the cat's ordinary hair, with roots that go three times deeper, surrounded by nerves and blood vessels. Vibrissae should never be trimmed, as they are a needed tool for cats. They will fall out occasionally, just as regular hairs shed, but replacements will grow back in.</p><p>A cat's whiskers are so sensitive that they can feel the slightest whisper of a breeze. Their whiskers are invaluable in judging wind speed and direction, which helps both for self-protection and for identifying the location of potential prey.</p><h2>Preventing Problems During a Head Examination</h2><p>If your cat begins to balk at the exam, take a break. You'll want to be thorough, but there is no reason to cause your cat distress. Give the cat some time and then pick up where you left off. The exam can be carried out over a few hours or days, but make sure you do finish it and date your notes correctly.</p>",1039
114,https://www.thesprucepets.com/anal-gland-expression-in-cats-552152,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>Anal Glands in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Anal Glands in Cats</h1><p>Many mammals, including cats, have special glands called anal glands or sacs located around their rectum. These glands typically go unnoticed until a cat owner smells the secretions from the glands or there is an issue with them. Knowing the purpose of these glands, as well as the potential issues that they can develop, will help you keep your cat happy and healthy.</p><h2>Cat Anal Gland Anatomy</h2><p>Both male and female cats have two pea-sized anal glands located around their rectal openings. From the outside, two very small holes on either side of the anal opening may be seen. If the rectal opening was the face of a clock, each anal gland would sit at about five o'clock and seven o'clock around the rectum.</p><p>These tiny, visible openings lead to the small, balloon-like anal sacs that are under the skin of a cat. These sacs naturally fill with a foul-smelling fluid that is naturally expressed when a cat defecates. The fluid in the glands is typically a liquid but it can thicken and become gritty, or even chunky, if it is stored for too long in the sacs or there is an underlying issue.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Have Anal Glands?</h2><p>Anal glands serve a specific purpose by helping a cat mark its territory. In the wild, cats mark their territory several different ways, and secreting anal gland fluid is just one way to communicate their presence to other animals. As a cat defecates, its feces naturally push against the internal portion of the balloon-like anal gland which causes it to be squeezed and secrete the anal gland fluid out with the feces. A cat can also manually express its anal glands, much like a skunk does, if it is scared or frightened. This is often seen when a stressed cat needs to visit the veterinarian or groomer. The anal gland liquid may spray or just drip out resulting in a very bad odor.</p><h2>Signs That Your Cat Has Anal Gland Problems</h2><p>Your cat may be showing signs that it is having issues with its anal glands.</p><h3>Signs of Anal Gland Issues in Cats</h3><p>Cats that have an uncomfortable hind end due to anal gland issues are likely to scoot or drag their hind end on the ground. This may be an attempt to relieve the pressure and discomfort that a cat is experiencing from having full anal sacs. You may smell or see a smelly fluid after your cat does this, too. Obsessive licking at the rectal opening and crying when defecating are also signs that there may be a problem with the glands. Finally, if you see blood in your cat's feces or on the carpet after your cat scoots its hind end, this could be a sign of an anal gland issue as well.</p><h2>Problems With Cat Anal Glands</h2><p>While most cats do not need help expressing their anal glands, occasionally these glands need a little help. Manual anal gland expression is not a pleasant job for the person doing the expression or the cat but it can be necessary if they don't naturally drain when a cat defecates. If these glands are not expressed naturally or manually, your cat will experience discomfort, infection, impaction, and potentially even painful anal gland rupture. Several reasons exist as to why cat anal glands may not express on their own.</p><h2>Treatment for Cat Anal Gland Problems</h2><p>If a cat needs to have its anal glands manually expressed it is likely it has an underlying reason for why the glands aren't naturally expressing.</p><p>Usually, anal gland issues begin with inflammation which can lead to an infection. If a cat develops an infected anal gland, it will receive antibiotics and may need the glands flushed and cleaned out. But if the anal glands are impacted due to the thickening of the fluid and are unable to be emptied with manual pressure, then a veterinarian will need to sedate or anesthetize your cat in order to remove the contents of the anal glands. If the impaction is not addressed, the glands will rupture and will need to be cleaned out under anesthesia while the pain and infection are also managed. If a tumor is found then surgery will be necessary to remove it.</p><p>If no inflammation, infection, impaction, rupture, or tumors are found, your cat's weight and diet may need to be addressed to help manage the anal gland issues.</p><h2>Manually Expressing Cat Anal Glands</h2><p>Manual anal gland expression is easy to learn how to do but cats do not enjoy it. Ask a veterinarian about restraint methods, distraction techniques, and exactly how to safely express a cat's anal glands if your cat needs it and you want to try and do it at home. Manual pressure is applied to the glands by inserting a finger into the rectum and firmly but gently squeezing the small, balloon-like gland on the edge of the rectal opening. This causes the anal gland secretions to come out.</p><h2>Preventing Cat Anal Gland Problems</h2><p>The best thing you can do for a cat to help prevent anal gland issues is to feed it high-quality cat food and don't allow it to get overweight.</p><p>If you're still worried about it developing anal gland problems, be sure to let your veterinarian know if it's scooting its rear end on the floor or has any inflammation around the rectal area. Monitor your cat's stool for diarrhea and do not attempt to express the anal glands unnecessarily. Manually expressing anal glands without them needing it can actually irritate the glands unnecessarily so it is best to leave them alone unless a reason to express them arises.</p>",926
115,https://www.thesprucepets.com/vaccine-protocols-for-cats-552506,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>The Vaccination Conundrum: Your Guide to Protocols for Cat Vaccines</h1>,"<h1>The Vaccination Conundrum: Your Guide to Protocols for Cat Vaccines</h1><h2>Is Your Cat Safe from Communicable Disease?</h2><p>Recent years have brought much discussion among veterinarians, breeders, and cat owners on the value, safety, and necessity of some vaccines.</p><p>I ran into this kind of dilemma in 2015 when facing a move 2,600 miles from California to Georgia, which requires rabies vaccines in all dogs and cats. Rabies vaccines are also required in many of the states we drove through along the way. In that instance, we consulted with our trusted veterinarian, and based on her input, had all six of our cats vaccinated for rabies.</p><p>Unfortunately, there is no one answer that would be applicable to all cats, but with a better understanding of the facts, you can work with your own veterinarian to work out a vaccination scheme that will provide the safest protection for your cat.</p><h2>How Do Vaccines Protect my Cat?</h2><p>Vaccines do not inject a miraculous shield against disease. They work by fooling the body into thinking it is threatened, thereby stimulating the body's own defense system into producing antibodies to fight off the invader. Vaccines are made from either killed viruses or live viruses that have been altered to not cause disease (modified live or MLV), and can be given individually, although some serums are often given as a group (multivalent), e.g. the ""3-Way,"" or FVRCP.</p><p>Vaccines are most commonly given by injection, although several new intranasal vaccines have been developed.</p><p>After the initial first vet visit, and ""kitten shots,"" boosters are given to boost the cat's defense system. Traditionally, veterinarians have asked owners to bring their cats in for annual boosters, along with their annual well-cat checkup, however, times are changing and many veterinarians are moving to an every three year protocol, with some exceptions.</p><p>Beginning in the late 90's, there was concern about vaccines in cats causing tumors at the injection sites. These were originally termed ""vaccine-associated feline soft tissue sarcomas."" Though rare, these tumors were serious, so a task force was developed to research the cause. Ultimately it was discovered that many types injections can cause these tumors, not just vaccines, and they were renamed ""injection site sarcomas."" It was not the vaccines themselves causing the problem, but the inflammation caused by the needle stick. For this reason, a move towards using three year vaccines has occurred. It is also recommended that vaccines be given as low on the leg as possible, or on the tail, so that these tumors can be more easily treated if they do occur.</p><h2>Live VS Killed Vaccines</h2><p>FVRCP vaccines are available in either version, and your veterinarian will be able to select the appropriate one for your cat, based on his health history. MLVs are generally preferred in most cases, but you'll want to discuss this matter thoroughly with your veterinarian.</p><p>Rabies vaccines are only available as killed viruses.</p><h2>Feline Vaccines Not Normally Recommended</h2> <h2>Other Vaccination Exceptions</h2><h2>FeLV Vaccine</h2><p>FeLV is a very serious, and always fatal disease, however it does require direct contact with an infected animal to be contracted. The disease is transmitted through saliva and nasal secretions, by biting, sharing food dishes, and other close contact. All cats should be tested for this disease at least once during their lives, and at any other time when they might have had contact with an infected cat or are acting sick. New cats to a household must always be tested prior to introduction to the environment. All cats with a positive ELISA screening test should be segregated from other cats.</p><p>It is recommended that all kittens be vaccinated for FeLV so that they have some protection if they ever come into contact with an infected cat. After the initial kitten vaccinations, only cats that spend time outdoors or are otherwise deemed ""at risk"" need to receive boosters. In those cases, it should be given every 1-2 years, according to the AAFP guidelines.</p> <p>The reasoning behind this, unpleasant as it may sound, is that a injection site sarcoma on the leg can be treated by amputation, allowing affected cats to survive. Cats are wonderfully adaptive and usually adjust quite quickly to navigating on three legs.</p><h2>Multivalent Cat Vaccines</h2><p>Traditionally, kittens have been given a ""3-way vaccine,"" which contains agents against feline calicivirus, herpesvirus and feline panleukopenia (FRCP), all given in one ""shot."" These are considered ""core"" vaccines and are essential for all cats. A 4-way vaccine, adding Chlamydia is also available, for cats at risk of contracting the latter (primarily show cats.)</p><p>Since each needle stick puts a cat at risk for injection site sarcomas, it is generally recommended by veterinarians to use a multivalent vaccine in most cases rather than vaccinating separately.</p><h2>Cat Vaccine Decision Time</h2><p>Before making any decision regarding the withholding of recommended vaccinations, it is suggested you do your homework. Don't use this article or any other single article as the basis for a decision, but read as many varying opinions as you can find. This article is not intended to definitively answer any questions, but to stimulate the reader into doing his or her own research. There is much more to be learned about vaccination pros and cons and I have only touched the tip of the iceberg.</p><p>The bottom line, as always, is that these are issues you should discuss with your own veterinarian in deciding which vaccinations your cat needs and how often. Every household varies, and the decision is a very personal one, to be made in an informed manner rather than as a result of rumors and panic. In any case, if you and your veterinarian agree to forgo the annual vaccination scheme, make sure you still take your cat in at least once a year for a well-cat check-up and for needed dental cleaning, along with titer-checking, if that's in the plan.</p>",952
116,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-ate-dryer-sheet-4783511,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Preventive Care,<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Ate a Dryer Sheet</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Ate a Dryer Sheet</h1><p>Curious cats and kittens can get into all kinds of inappropriate items around the house. There are many hazardous chemicals and dangerous items in the average household. Among these are fabric softeners, both in dryer sheets and liquid formulation. You may think that something like a dryer sheet is safe, but it is actually a very dangerous thing for your cat to eat.</p><h2>The Danger of Dryer Sheets for Cats</h2><p>Dryer sheets and fabric softeners usually contain harsh chemicals called cationic surfactants. These chemicals are in high concentrations that are released in the dryer. The chemicals coat fabrics to reduce static cling and soften their texture. In addition, most dryer sheets are made from synthetic materials that do not break down easily in the gastrointestinal tract. Both of these features make dryer sheets very dangerous to cats.</p><p>Cats are typically very sensitive to chemicals, and those in fabric softeners are no exception. The caustic chemicals can lead to irritation and ulceration in the mouth and GI tract. Skin irritation can occur as well. In serious cases, the ingestion of these harmful chemicals can lead to organ damage or central nervous system depression.</p><p>Also, a cat that eats a dryer sheet ingestion may develop gastrointestinal obstruction. A blockage in the GI tract can lead to serious illness and even death. In many cases, GI obstructions need to be removed surgically or via endoscopy. These procedures can increase the risks to your cat's health.</p><p>Secondly, the chemicals in fabric softeners can cause irritation to the skin, mucous membranes and stomach lining. In concentrated amounts, the damage may be serious and appear as burns or ulcers. In addition, some of these chemicals can lead to lung damage, central nervous system depression, and acute kidney disease.</p><h2>What to Do if Your Cat Eats Fabric Softener</h2><p>If you think that your cat ate a dryer sheet or drank some liquid fabric softener, it is essential to contact your veterinarian immediately. try to induce vomiting-this may increase the irritation to the esophagus and mouth. Gather all the details to share with the vet, such as the brand of the chemical, the time your cat ate it, approximately how much was eaten.</p><p>Depending on the situation, your vet may recommend you bring your cat into the animal hospital for treatment. It is possible that your vet will be able to recommend home treatment, but it is more likely that you will need to visit the vet in person. Try to bring the fabric softener packaging so your vet can determine exactly what your cat ate. Your vet may need to get in touch with animal poison control to find out more about the toxicity of that specific brand.</p><h2>How to Keep Your Cat Safe</h2><p>The best way to prevent cats from eating dryer sheets is to keep them out of reach. All chemicals in the home should be stored out of reach and, if possible, behind closed doors. Curious cats are persistent and tend to get into places where they don't belong.</p><p>If you do not have a laundry room with a door that closes, then the chemicals should be secured up high and behind secure cabinet doors. Keep the washer and dryer doors closed at all times.</p><p>Although used dryer sheets have lower concentrations of chemicals, it doesn't mean they are safe. Residual chemicals may be enough to cause irritation to your cat's skin and mouth as a result of self-grooming. Additionally, ingested used dryer sheets can still lead to intestinal blockage.</p><p>Many cats love to snuggle up in warm, clean laundry, where they might find a random dryer sheet to lick or eat. That's why you should keep clean laundry out of reach and dispose of used dryer sheets in a place where your cat can't find them. Better yet, fold and put away fabric items right after they come out of the dryer.</p><p>""Natural"" and environmentally friendly products, although potentially leas harmful, are not necessarily safe. They should still be kept out of the reach of all pets in the home. If your cat eats a natural fabric softener, you should still contact the vet for advice.</p><p>Don't use fabric softeners on your cat's bedding as the residual chemicals can still cause problems. Remember that cats are fastidious groomers and may get the chemicals in their mouth.</p><p>You might have heard of people using dryer sheets to remove dead hairs from their cats' coats and reduce shedding. This never recommended since your cat is likely to lick the chemical residue from his fur.</p><p>Consider safer alternatives to chemical fabric softeners, such as dryer balls made of wool or plastic. These can soften fabrics in the dryer without chemicals. You may even find that adding clean tennis balls to the dryer works well to soften fabrics.</p>",793
117,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-pregnancy-stages-555411,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>Cat Pregnancy Stages</h1>,"<h1>Cat Pregnancy Stages</h1><p>In most cases, responsible pet ownership involves spaying and neutering cats. Not only does spaying reduce the number of unwanted cats, but it also protects your own cat from developing various diseases, like breast cancer and uterine infections, that can occur in the reproductive system. However, if you find yourself caring for a pregnant cat, no matter if the breeding was intentional, understanding the stages of pregnancy will ensure a healthy gestation period for both mom and her kittens.</p><h2>Fertilization</h2><p>In order for a cat to conceive, it must first be receptive to mating, which occurs in estrus, or when cats are ""in heat."" An unspayed cat's heat cycles can start anytime after 4 months of age and most often occur seasonally between February to April in the Northern Hemisphere, but can extend through the late fall in some cases. When your cat is in estrus, it is ready to mate and will be receptive to males for approximately seven days, but this timeframe can vary greatly. During this time your cat will generally be much more vocal and affectionate. Your cat may also urinate more frequently or mark objects with urine. Cats are induced ovulators,which means the act of mating stimulates their ovaries to release eggs to be fertilized, so mating does not have to be timed to a set ovulation event.</p><p><br />The fertilization of a cat's egg (ovum) involves several steps. Once a sperm and egg fuse, it is called a zygote. Then, many rounds of cell division occur to form the initial cells that will give rise to all the structures of the embryo. Each step brings a new stage in the embryo's development. Implantation in the lining of the uterus occurs roughly two weeks after fertilization. Embryos implant along the uterine horns in an evenly spaced formation.</p><h2>Embryo Development</h2><p>As the embryos continue to develop, cells migrate and specialize to form precursors of all the structures within the body. This starts as three distinct layers of cells that will eventually form the skin and nervous system, the intestinal organs, and the rest of the organs. The placenta begins to form at the time of implantation and allows for the exchange of nutrients and waste products between the mother and embryo. Each embryo has its own amniotic sac and placenta. They reach about 2.5 cm in diameter by the third week of pregnancy and may be palpable by an experienced veterinarian during a physical exam.</p><p>Within the first month of gestation, as the embryos continue to develop, your cat will gain weight and increase her intake of food. As pregnancy progresses, your cat's nipples may become swollen and darker in color, and she may have behavior changes including signs of nesting. It is important to provide good quality cat food that is labeled for use in pregnant cats or a kitten food that will have more nutrients and calories to offer</p><h2>Ongoing Gestation and Labor</h2><p>As your queen nears her due date (approximately nine weeks from fertilization, or 65 days after mating), she will exhibit signs of impending labor. This includes nesting-snooping around in closets and secluded areas for an appropriate place to bear her kittens and bringing soft materials into her chosen area to create a warm, soft, nesting area. It is a good idea for you to help prepare an area in a private, quiet place, with a box or basket lined with soft towels or other safe bedding materials.</p><p>From now until birth, the growth of the fetuses will be your cat's main objective, requiring a great deal of her body's energy. Make sure to provide high-quality food intended for pregnant cats, or feed a higher calorie kitten food. She should also be kept indoors and stress should be minimized.</p><p>Increased affection is another sign of impending labor. Your cat may want to be around you all the time. Other signs that your cat is about to go into labor include behavioral changes such as restlessness, pacing, panting, nesting behavior, continuous purring, and being unfriendly toward strangers and other cats.</p><p>About 24 to 48 hours before birth, your cat may have milky discharge coming from her nipples. This indicates ""go time""-kittens are on their way.</p><p>Once labor begins, it is usually fairly quick, with all the kittens being delivered in 6-8 hours. The mother should continue to deliver kittens every 60 minutes or less until they are all delivered. If she is pushing for more than 60 minutes without a kitten born, it could be a sign of a problem and you should contact your vet right away. Sometimes cats can temporarily pause their labor if they are stressed, so it is very important to provide that safe, quiet space and give them as much privacy as possible to reduce stress. If labor is paused, no pushing would be observed, so this would be different from a cat who is pushing unsuccessfully.</p><h2>Pregnant Cat Care</h2><p>If you are caring for a pregnant cat , take her to the vet for a ""well-check"" immediately. Make sure she is up to date with routine health screenings, including FIV (Feline Immunodeficiency Virus) and FelV (Feline Leukemia Virus) testing, and discuss other preventative health measures that are important and safe for a pregnant cat.</p><p>Assuming your cat is healthy, proper care during pregnancy includes a diet high in nutrients, along with fresh, clean water. Your cat should also be kept indoors at all times. During pregnancy, switch your pregnant cat to premium-quality kitten food or a food labeled for use in pregnant and nursing cats, and continue feeding her this way until after the kittens are weaned.</p><h2>Potential Problems</h2><p>Problems with pregnancy or birth are rare, but can be serious if they occur. For this reason, it is important to have the phone number and location of the closest emergency veterinary clinic on hand.</p><p>In general, any unusual symptoms during gestation should be followed through with a call or visit to your veterinarian. This is an important part of the care of a pregnant cat. Although many pregnant cats go through gestation trouble-free, there are potential problems that can occur. Learn to spot the specific symptoms of trouble and what action to take to ensure the health of a pregnant cat and her fetuses. The following are a few conditions to be aware of so that you can spot the symptoms, if they should occur, and take proper action.</p><h2>Eclampsia</h2><p>The depletion of calcium can result in eclampsia, a life-threatening condition, which most often occurs when the kittens are one to four weeks of age and the mother is producing the most milk. It can also occur prior to delivery. Pregnant or nursing cats that show any of these signs should see a vet right away. Treatment includes calcium supplementation and supportive care. It can be more severe in subsequent pregnancies so this is something to keep in mind.</p><h2>Spontaneous Abortion</h2><p>Poor health of the pregnant cat, including certain infections may result in spontaneous abortion. If this happens early in the pregnancy, the embryos are simply resorbed by the mother's body and no symptoms occur. If symptoms do occur, they may include fever, bleeding or green discharge from the vagina, and depression.</p><h2>Resorption</h2><p>Resorption is an interesting phenomenon in which a dead embryo is completely absorbed by the queen's system early in pregnancy. There are rarely any outward symptoms when resorption occurs. Since there are usually multiple kittens in a litter, you may never know this occurred as the birth of the rest of the kittens will proceed as normal. If fewer kittens than expected were born, a veterinary visit is essential to ensure that there are no remaining fetuses inside the queen.</p>",1265
118,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-was-spayed-still-in-heat-3385386,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>Can My Spayed Cat Still Be in Heat?</h1>,"<h1>Can My Spayed Cat Still Be in Heat?</h1><h2>Why You Still May See the Signs</h2><p>Female cats will undergo their first estrous, or heat cycle, when they become sexually mature. This can occur as early as four months, but the typical age is somewhere between six and nine months of age. Estrus is the period when a female is receptive to mating with a male, shows signs of being in heat, and can become pregnant during this time. If the female does not become pregnant, she will continue through the estrous cycle and will go into heat every few weeks until she either becomes pregnant or is spayed.</p><p>Cats in heat will exhibit signs that can be quite annoying for owners. If they are spayed, those signs should not be present. However, there are a few conditions where spayed cats will continue to show signs of being in heat. Here, we will discuss the signs of heat in cats, causes of heat signs in a spayed cat, and why treatment is important if your cat is in heat after a spay.</p><h2>Signs of Heat in Cats</h2><p>Unlike dogs, the female cat in heat does not have a vaginal discharge. Her signs are typically behavioral in nature. The more common signs an owner may notice is that she becomes unusually affectionate and quite vocal. She may urinate or spray in the house in an attempt to let local tomcats know she is receptive to mating. She also has a tendency to stick her rear in the air and wiggle her back end when she is petted. If a cat that has been spayed is exhibiting signs of being in heat, this could be an indication there is still sex hormone in her system. If you notice any signs of heat in your spayed cat, please speak with your veterinarian.</p><h2>Causes of Heat Signs in Spayed Cats</h2><h3>Ovarian Remnant Syndrome</h3><p>If a spayed cat shows signs of heat, it is possible that there is ovarian tissue still in the body and producing estrogen. This can happen for a few different reasons. In rare cases, a small piece of ovarian tissue could be left behind during surgery, allowing continued secretion of estrogen and signs of heat. In other cases, a female cat could possess accessory ovarian tissue separate from the main ovaries that could continue to secrete estrogen after a spay is performed In even more rare cases, if a small amount of ovarian tissue accidentally fell back into the abdomen during the spay surgery, it could continue to secrete estrogen if it could develop a new blood supply.</p><p>A cat showing signs of heat after a spay should go the vet as soon as possible for testing. This often includes bloodwork to determine if hormone levels are high and consistent with active ovarian tissue. Occasionally imaging such as an ultrasound will be performed to look for the remaining reproductive tissue but it is usually quite small. Once it has been determined that a pet has an ovarian remnant, surgery should be performed to locate and remove it.</p><h3>Stump Pyometra</h3><p>After a cat is spayed, a small stump of uterine tissue remains inside the abdomen where the tract is tied off. As long as there are no female hormones available, the stump will be a small, inactive tissue. However, if hormones are circulating due to an ovarian remnant or other source of estrogen, this tissue will be active. Over time, an infection of the uterine tissue can develop, which is known as a pyometra. When a pyometra develops in the stump, vaginal discharge may be observed, and the cat may have other signs of illness including fever, lethargy, or decreased appetite, If a stump pyometra is suspected, exploratory surgery may be necessary to remove it as well as to locate the ovarian remnant that supplied the hormones. Your veterinarian will help determine the right treatment plan for your cat.</p><h3>Adrenal Tumors</h3><p>Adrenal tumors can also produce hormones. The adrenal glands are 2 small glands located next to the kidneys that normally produce important hormones for many body functions. However, tumors of the adrenal glands can produce hormones in excess that can cause a number of different symptoms. In very rare cases, these tumors could produce excessive sex hormones and lead to behavior changes consistent with being in heat. In this situation, signs of heat are constant, they don't cycle as with ovarian tissue. A number of tests may be performed to determine if this is the cause of your cat's symptoms including blood work and abdominal ultrasound to look for a tumor. Exploratory surgery is necessary to visualize the tumor as well as to remove it with the affected adrenal gland. This can be a very complicated surgery.</p><h3>Hormone Exposure</h3><p>Topical estrogen-containing creams for humans may be accidentally ingested by cats or other pets. When these creams are applied to the user's hands or arms, they are easily accessible to an affectionate cat who may lick them off. A female cat exposed to these creams can potentially manifest signs of heat but will not show a predictable hormone cycle. She might also show other signs of estrogen exposure including mammary development, swollen vulva, pale gums, or hair loss. The best way to avoid this is for owners to use gloves during application and to make sure to wash hands and to keep cats and other pets away from any part of the body where this cream is applied.</p><h3>Your Cat was not Spayed</h3><p>In some cases, a cat showing signs of heat may turn out to be intact, meaning she was never spayed in the first place. This is most common in cases of an adult cat being adopted or a stray cat who is found as an adult without a clear history of spay or previous heat cycles. Sometimes owners believe the cat was spayed based on a lack of heat cycles at the time of rescue, or perhaps they are told by a previous caretaker that the cat is believed to be spayed. In any case, your veterinarian can check for a spay scar by shaving your cat's belly, and if there is any doubt, blood work can be done to check your cat's hormone levels. Nowadays, many animal shelters and rescue groups also apply a small green or blue tattoo mark on the abdomen after a spay to ensure a cat's spay status can be easily confirmed.</p><h2>Why is Treatment Important?</h2><p>Hormones have important roles in the body, however they can also have harmful effects. Long term exposure to female sex hormones can dramatically increase the risk of mammary cancer. This is why it is recommended to spay cats prior to their first heat cycle. So speak with your veterinarian right away if you notice your spayed cat is experiencing signs of heat. They will work with you to determine what is causing the behavior change and identify the best way to treat them.</p>",1145
119,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-wont-feed-newborn-kittens-554851,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>What to Do if a Mother Cat Can't Nurse Her Kittens</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if a Mother Cat Can't Nurse Her Kittens</h1><p>Your cat has gone through pregnancy, and she has delivered her kittens. Now the time has come for her to take care of her kittens, but for some reason, she can't nurse them. Perhaps she has rejected one or more of her kittens or you're simply not sure if her milk supply is adequate. In most cases, mother cats give birth to kittens and take care of them with little or no human intervention. However, there are times when human intervention may be needed to support the kittens. What is a concerned cat owner to do?</p><h2>Why a Mother Cat Can't Nurse Her Kittens</h2><p>There are several potential scenarios for why a mother cat can't adequately nurse her kittens. In some cases, the mother cat will start nursing and then stop. Or, the mother cat may never begin nursing in the first place. The mother cat may reject some or all of the kittens. Not only may she refuse to nurse a kitten; she may ignore them altogether or act aggressively when approached by a kitten. Sometimes the problem is not with the mother cat, but with a particular kitten, or multiple kittens. Kittens that are smaller or have other medical issues may have more trouble latching and getting adequate milk from nursing. These problems can be exacerbated in especially large litters of kittens when there is more competition for time and space to nurse.</p><p>If anything like this happens, your first step should be to contact your veterinarian. You may need to take the mother and kittens in for an exam, however, this can be stressful to a new mom, so it may be best to contact your vet first and find out what she recommends. If you can discover the reason why a mother cat can't feed her kitten, you may have a better chance of getting her to successfully nurse. Or, you may need to step in and care for the kittens yourself. Either way, your vet can help.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Based on what your veterinarian recommends, you may need to bring the mother and all of her kittens along to the vet, regardless of which ones do or do not appear sick.</p><h3>Illness in the Mother Cat</h3><h3>Sick or Deformed Kittens</h3><p>The mother cat may detect or suspect a health problem in one or more kittens and refuse to nurse that individual. She may put the sick kitten out of the nesting box in an instinctive attempt to protect the other kittens. The problem may be an obvious congenital abnormality or a major illness or something more subtle. Putting a rejected kitten back into the nesting box is unlikely to be successful and may stress the mother further. Instead, consult your veterinarian on the proper way to bottle-feed and keep the rejected kitten warm as you make arrangements to have the kitten examined by your vet.</p><h3>Large Litter of Kittens</h3><p>Some litters can be so large that the mother does not have enough teats to feed all of her kittens at the same time. She may also not produce enough milk to feed everyone. The larger, stronger kittens may outcompete the smaller ones and/or the mother may reject any that are ill or become too weak. In this case, the best option would be to bottle-feed any kittens that seem small, to be nursing less often, or are separated from the rest of the litter. Keep them warm and be sure to contact your veterinarian right away.</p><h3>Immature Mother Cat</h3><p>Very young cats may lack the energy reserves to produce enough milk if they are very thin and/or they are still growing themselves. A female cat may be able to get pregnant as young as four months of age. In most cases, young cats will face more challenges in maintaining their own health while also caring for a litter of kittens. If you have a young cat who has kittens who are not nursing well or gaining weight, you will need to step in and help. Take them to the vet to be examined and talk to your vet about how you can best help the mother and kittens.</p><h2>How to Bottle Feed Kittens</h2><p>If the mother cat can't feed one or more of the newborn kittens at all, it's important to get to a veterinarian as soon as possible. In the meantime, you must find a way to feed the kittens since they need to eat every few hours with the exact frequency depending on their age. This is usually done by bottle-feeding kitten formula. It is also essential to provide motherly care to newborn kittens. Keep them warm and help them urinate and defecate after each feeding.</p><p>The most commonly available type of kitten formula is called KMR, which stands for ""kitten milk replacer."" KMR comes in cans or cartons and is available to buy in most pet supply stores and on websites that sell pet supplies. There are other brands of kitten formula available as well.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Cow's milk or human baby formula are not nutritionally appropriate for kittens and will lead to serious health problems and death if fed to newborn kittens.</p><p>You can use a small kitten feeding bottle to administer formula to the kittens. Kittens should be bottle fed while laying on their bellies, not their backs. Newborn kittens will need to be bottle-fed about once every two hours. Warm the formula gently and feed about 3-5mL (up to 1 teaspoon) per kitten per feeding. Most kittens will stop suckling when they are full so if a kitten unlatches from the bottle, it is most likely full. Additionally, you should stop a feeding if you notice formula coming out of the nose, or if you can feel that the belly is distended. Ask your veterinarian about the proper amounts to feed as the kittens grow as their needs will change quickly. Additionally, it is very important to monitor the kittens' weights, so they should be weighed daily using a gram scale.</p><p>If your cat is expecting kittens, it's a good idea to have some kitten formula on hand in case the mother has trouble nursing. If you don't end up needing to bottle-feed, you can always use it later to moisten kitten food when the kittens begin weaning onto solid food. Or you can donate the kitten formula to a cat shelter or rescue group.</p><h2>What to Do After You Visit the Vet</h2><p>If you have seen your veterinarian and determined that ongoing bottle-feeding will be necessary, it is important to plan ahead for the coming weeks. Kittens should be easy to identify from one another so you can accurately keep track of which kittens have been fed, how much they eat, as well as monitoring their weights and any other signs of illness. The easiest way is to place collars on them to tell them apart. Make sure to use collars that are small enough so as not to interfere with nursing or mobility and ensure a proper fit so tiny paws can't get stuck in them. Kittens should be bottle-fed kitten milk for at least the first four weeks of their lives. You may begin to introduce canned kitten food around three weeks of age in additional to bottle-feeding and once the kitten is eating on its own, gradually start reducing the amount of milk you offer.</p>",1217
120,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mastitis-in-cats-4174702,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>Mastitis In Cats</h1>,"<h1>Mastitis In Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Cats have four sets of mammary glands, also called breasts or teats. Occasionally, a female cat can develop a very painful infection in one or more of her teats. This is called mastitis, and it is most often seen in female cats that are nursing kittens.</p><p>You'll usually notice a reddened, swollen teat, and your cat might be lethargic. But sometimes the only sign of mastitis is that the kittens are not growing as quickly as expected. Left untreated, however, mastitis usually become worse, and the cat's teats can eventually become ulcerated. At this point, infection can spread through the animal's bloodstream, a condition called septicemia. This not only endangers the mother cat's life, but it can also put the nursing kittens at risk as they ingest the bacteria-laden milk.</p><h2>What Is Mastitis?</h2><p>Inflammation of the breast is called mastitis and can occur in any animal that nurses its young, including humans, dogs, and cats. Inflammation causes redness, pain, and swelling to the affected breast. Mastitis can occur in one or multiple breasts of a cat, but most often affects the teats located closest to the hind legs.</p><p>Usually, mastitis in cats is caused by a bacterial infection that makes its way up the milk duct and into the breast tissue. Slight trauma to the nipples caused by vigorously nursing kittens can allow bacteria to enter the female cat's body. Less commonly, a cat that lives in a very unsanitary environment can develop bacterial mastitis even without direct trauma to the teats. Mastitis is not directly contagious to other animals, however.</p><p>Mastitis can also occur when too much milk accumulates in the cat's breasts. This can happen when kittens are weaned too quickly, as that doesn't give enough time for milk production to taper off naturally. It can also happen after one or more kittens in a litter die, which abruptly reduces milk consumption.</p><h2>Symptoms of Mastitis in Cats</h2><p>An early indicator that your cat has mastitis may be that the kittens it is nursing are not gaining weight as they should. This may be because milk is not able to pass through the inflamed teat canal and therefore the kitten does not get the food it needs. As the mastitis progresses, however, symptoms will appear in the female cat.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>You can identify mastitis by looking at your cat's breasts to see if they are swollen, red, and feel warmer than the rest of its body. There may be some discharge from the teat, and the breast will<br />most likely be painful to your cat if you try to touch it.</p><p>Severe cases of mastitis in a cat will cause the breast to turn a purple color, develop sores or ulcerations, and leak blood or pus. These cats often have fevers, are lethargic, have a decreased appetite, and eventually, start vomiting if the infection has entered the bloodstream. At this point, nursing kittens may also become ill as they themselves are infected by the tainted milk.</p><h2>Causes of Mastitis</h2><p>The most common reason for mastitis to occur is a bacterial infection, although occasionally fungal infections can be to blame. , spp., spp., and spp. are the bacteria that most often cause this painful infection.</p><p>Usually, female cats that have recently given birth and are nursing are affected by mastitis. Kittens push and climb on the mother cat's breasts while they nurse, and their tiny claws can carry bacteria from feces that then enter the teat through tiny breaks in the skin. Mastitis is even likelier if the cats are living in a dirty environment, such as in a feral colony, a poorly maintained kennel, or a busy animal shelter.</p><p>Trauma to a breast can also cause mastitis, even in cats that are not nursing, although this is uncommon. The inflammation caused by some sort of injury can make it easier for bacteria to enter the breast, or simply cause inflammation in the breast without bacterial involvement. Cats that are hit by cars, that have been in fights, or that have endured other trauma to the breast area are all at risk for developing mastitis.</p><p>In addition to bacteria and trauma, nursing female cats may develop mastitis if there is sudden milk accumulation in a breast. This can occur due to prematurely weaned kittens, the loss of a kitten, or if kittens are not using all the breasts to nurse.</p><h2>Diagnosis of Mastitis</h2><p>Often, your veterinarian will diagnose mastitis simply by observing the appearance of the nursing cat's teats. It's likely, however, that your vet will order tests to rule out other conditions and to confirm the presence of bacteria. Common tests include a complete blood count to determine if the white blood cell count is high; this is an indicator of infection.</p><p>Your vet may also examine a few drops of milk under a microscope to check for bacteria or fungi. Occasionally, a sample of the milk will be sent to the lab to be cultured; this means placing the milk sample on a special growth medium and incubating it for a day or two to see if infectious bacteria grow in significant numbers.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If mastitis is the result of a bacterial infection, it will need to be treated with antibiotics. Special medicated wipes may be recommended by your veterinarian, and antibiotics, pain medications, and anti-inflammatory medications may also be prescribed to treat the infection and its symptoms.</p><p>Your veterinarian might suggest you hand-milk the affected teat every six hours, which reduces swelling and pain. You should keep the cat's bedding and surroundings as clean as possible and clean the affected teat as recommended by the vet.</p><p>Cabbage leaf compression, as strange as it may sound, is also regularly recommended to treat mastitis in cats. This is done by taking a cabbage leaf, applying it to the inflamed teat, and leaving it there for about three hours at a time. A bandage or small t-shirt is often used to hold the leaf in place on the cat. The cabbage leaf is then removed for another three hours, and this process is repeated as needed or recommended. This helps to relieve inflammation.</p><p>Occasionally, if the mastitis is so severe that it has caused ulcerated tissue or tissue death to the teat, your cat may require surgical removal of the affected tissue.</p><h2>Preventing Mastitis in Cats</h2><p>It's not always possible to prevent mastitis, but keeping the bedding and nursing box as clean as possible is the best way to ward off trouble. Mother cats clean themselves and their kittens frequently, but they also lie down to nurse their young, exposing their teats to potential bacterial contamination if the bedding is not clean.</p><p>You can also help prevent mastitis by making sure the kittens are nursing from all of the teats and not just a few of them, and routinely checking the teats for normal milk production by gently expressing them.</p><h2>Prognosis</h2><p>If treatment is started promptly, most cats recover completely from mastitis within a few weeks. However, if the infection has spread through the bloodstream, the prognosis is more guarded. That's why it's so important to take your cat to the vet at the first sign of mastitis.</p><p>Mastitis.</p>",1175
121,https://www.thesprucepets.com/care-of-a-pregnant-cat-555417,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>How to Care for a Pregnant Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for a Pregnant Cat</h1><p>Is your cat pregnant? In a perfect world, your cat would have been spayed before this could happen. Perhaps you accidentally waited too long to spay your cat (life happens). Or maybe you found or adopted a pregnant cat. Either way, she's now pregnant and you want to provide her with the best care possible.</p><h2>Should You Breed Your Cat?</h2><p>Cat overpopulation is a real problem. Please don't purposely breed your cat unless you are a responsible breeder who has a purebred cat of excellent quality and health. Your veterinarian should be involved in selecting if a cat is of excellent breeding health as a lof of problems are passed on through genetics. If you are new to cat breeding, seek out an experienced cat breeder to help you do things the right way for the sake of your cat and her kittens.</p><h2>Veterinary Care for Pregnant Cats</h2><p>If your cat is showing signs of pregnancy or you suspect your cat may have mated while she was in heat, the first step is to take her to see the veterinarian. Sometimes, it is early enough that you can still spay your cat. It is difficult to confirm a pregnancy on a cat until they are about three to four weeks into their pregnancy. However, if your cat seems ill or is showing odd signs, you should still bring her to the vet for assessment and let the vet know she might be pregnant.</p><p>At around three weeks into the pregnancy, your vet may be able to determine pregnancy by gently palpating your cat's abdomen though it can be difficult if the cat is obese or other factors like firm stool or a large bladder is present. If available, an ultrasound may be able to confirm pregnancy.</p><p>During this early to mid stage of pregnancy, your vet can talk to you about the option of spaying your cat and terminating the pregnancy. You may decide you wish to do so for your cat's health or to minimize cat overpopulation. If you decide to allow your cat to have the kittens, your vet can give you advice about caring for your pregnant cat as well as the care the kittens will need after birth. This is a good time to start thinking about how you will find good homes for the kittens.</p><p>About 55 days into the pregnancy, your vet may recommend taking a radiograph (X-ray) to look at the number of kittens expected. If you know how many fetuses your cat is carrying, you will be able to know when your cat is finished giving birth or if she is in some kind of distress in between kitten births.</p><p>Vaccinations are not recommended during pregnancy because they might have an adverse effect on the kittens' development though certain types of rabies vaccine may be ok.</p><h2>Feeding Pregnant Cats</h2><p>Your pregnant cat should be fed a high-quality food formulated for growth. Look for the AAFCO Nutritional Adequacy statement saying that the food is complete and balanced for growth and reproduction. This is often some type of kitten food. In general, wet food is a healthier choice than dry but both would be alright. When choosing foods, it is always best to ask your veterinarian which food they would recommend. .</p><p>Be careful not to overfeed your pregnant cat during her early weeks of pregnancy. Yes, she needs plenty of good nutrition for herself and her kittens. However, the kitten food contains the extra calories and nutrients she needs. If she becomes overweight, it can cause problems for her and the kittens. Gradually transition to the kitten food after you have confirmation of her pregnancy, but do not increase the amount she is fed unless she is underweight or acting hungry. Monitor her body condition during her pregnancy with help from your veterinarian.</p><p>Once your cat is about six weeks into her pregnancy, she should be fed more frequent small meals. The pressure on her stomach from the kittens makes it harder for her to eat much at a time, but she does need the extra food. Offer her small meals four to six times a day.</p><h2>Your Pregnant Cat's Environment</h2><p>Beyond some minor vet care and the nutritional changes, your pregnant cat should not have any special needs during most of her pregnancy. However, as she gets closer to queening (giving birth) she will start looking for a safe, quiet place to begin nesting. This usually begins a day or two before birth.</p><p>You can prepare a cardboard box or laundry basket by filling it with blankets and tucking it away to a safe, quiet area of your home. However, your cat may not decide to use it. As is the case with most cats, they'll do as they please. Your cat may choose to give birth in the most inconvenient place. If there are areas of the house you want to keep off-limits for queening, make sure those areas stay closed off during the last week of her pregnancy. Also, make sure she does not have access to the outdoors as she may sneak away to nest somewhere you can't find her.</p><p>Your cat may also act restless and even anxious as the birth approaches. This is perfectly normal. Just do your best to keep her comfortable and give her space. This will all be over soon.</p><h2>When Your Cat Is Ready to Give Birth</h2><p>Once your cat has chosen the area where she will give birth, it's best to leave her alone and observe from a safe distance. Fortunately, most cats need little if any human intervention when it comes to queening. However, you may need to assist if she is in distress.</p><p>Keep track of the time in between each birth and make sure you know how many kittens to expect. Contact your vet if your cat is having obvious contractions for more than 60 minutes without kitten birth. Also, get in touch with the vet if more than two hours go by without the next kitten birth. If a kitten remains in the birth canal without being pushed out for more than a minute or two, it's best to bring your cat right to the vet. Call your vet's office for advice if anything else seems wrong.</p><p>Avoid separating mom and kittens for the first few days and be sure to continue to provide adequate amount of food for a the momma cat who's caloric needs will increase significantly while she is lactating and feeding her kittens. Instead, bring them all into the vet's office for a check-up at about 6 weeks of age. If you are not a purebred cat breeder, talk to your vet about having your cat spayed as soon as possible. This is often done after the kittens are weaned.</p> ",1122

The truth is not quite as clear-cut as that, however. For instance, did you know that cats do not ovulate until they mate? Or that a female cat may give birth to five kittens, each from a different father? That male cats have barbed penises to stimulate the female cat to ovulate?.</p><h2>Mating and Conception in Cats</h2><p>You may have adopted or been given a female kitten, and now that she is a few months older, her behavior has suddenly become suspiciously ""amorous."" You are wondering could she possibly be in heat already? Yes, you've read about spaying, but haven't yet gotten around to it. Perhaps you're secretly thinking how nice it might be to have a litter of kittens--just one.</p><p>You love her, though, and you're also wondering if she could become pregnant at her age. What exactly would happen, should she someday slip out the door and encounter a frisky male cat with only one thing on his mind?</p><h2>Is Your Cat in Heat?</h2><p>Female cats that are not spayed will eventually come into heat (technically called estrus), and the signs are unambiguous, once you know what to look for. A kitten can have her first heat as early as 4 months, so don't fall for that old ""wait until six months to spay"" advice. And remember, that once a female cat has her first heat, it will happen again and again, until she either mates or is spayed. Here are some behavioral symptoms to watch for if you suspect your cat is in heat. For a vivid video description of a young cat in heat, also watch this YouTube video.</p><h2>Signs Your Cat Is Pregnant</h2><p>Cats in heat will go to any length to find male cats to mate with, and male cats have sometimes been known to tear down screens to get to a female in heat. If your cat was in heat and had access to a tom (un-neutered male) cat, the likelihood that she is pregnant is very high.</p><p>A pregnant queen will show both physical and personality changes which will first become more evident around three weeks after mating. Learn to recognize the signs your cat may be pregnant.</p><h2>So Your Cat Is Pregnant</h2><p>So you were a little slow in having her spayed and your cat turned up pregnant, or perhaps a pregnant stray adopted you. Maybe you are working with a rescue group and this is your first fostering experience with a pregnant cat. Where do you go from here? Your first major decision is whether or not to allow the condition to continue.</p><p>Yes, pregnant cats can be spayed, but the earlier in the pregnancy, the better. However, this is a decision you'll want to discuss with your family and your veterinarian.</p><h2>What to Expect</h2><p>The entire development of the embryo is a fascinating study with scientific names for each stage, but for brevity and better understanding, we'll concentrate here on the basics. Note: the process of development is more important to understand, rather than the names given along the way.</p><h2>Potential Problems in Cats' Pregnancy</h2><p>In general, any unusual symptoms during gestation should be followed through with a call or visit to your veterinarian. This is an important part of the care of a pregnant cat. Just like other species, pregnant cats may have some fetuses that do not survive or others that develop birth defects, which can range from mild to severe. Often, you will not know this is the case until she gives birth as most cats do not have ultrasounds performed routinely during pregnancy. Additionally, pregnant cats can have complications including premature labor, metabolic changes including gestational diabetes, fatty liver, or eclampsia (low calcium).</p><p>Although the majority of pregnant cats go through gestation trouble-free, there are potential problems that can occur, so it is important to monitor them closely and notify your veterinarian of anything that seems concerning. Being forewarned is being forearmed.</p><h2>Helping Your Cat Through the Birth Process</h2><p>Chances are that you will not need to do anything to help with the birth process except to be with your cat to encourage her as sort of a ""cat doula."" Make sure to keep your distance as stress can slow down the birthing process and most cats prefer privacy during delivery. You may even wake one morning to discover that your pregnant cat has given birth during the night, and is comfortably nursing her kittens. However, you should know how to spot potential problems and what action to take, should she need assistance with the birth process.</p><h2>Postnatal Care of Mother Cat and Newborns</h2><p>The first two to three weeks are the most crucial for your mother cat and her newborn kittens. The kittens should be developing rapidly, and the queen will be most at risk for postpartum problems during this time.</p><h2>Finding Homes for the Kittens</h2><p>Sending kittens away to a new ""forever home"" can be either a joyous or worrisome occasion, depending on how you handle the preparations. You have invested almost two months or more of work, worry, and probably expense, in caring for the mother cat and then the kittens. Their futures will depend on your investing a bit more time to ensure that the new homes they are going to are truly homes. Depending on the age of the kittens, you may want to have their first vaccines and other preventative health treatments done prior to adoption so consult your veterinarian on the timing.</p><p>The only thing left to do now is to have the mother cat spayed if this has not already been done. You've been responsible for her care during her pregnancy, and I'm sure you will agree that this is now the only responsible thing to do.</p>",970
123,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-long-are-cats-in-heat-3385372,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>What Happens When a Cat is Spayed?</h1>,"<h1>What Happens When a Cat is Spayed?</h1><p>Ovariohysterectomy, also known as a ""spay"", is the surgical removal of a female cat's ovaries and uterus. Young female cats that are not spayed will go into heat, and their chances of becoming pregnant are very high if exposed to intact (unneutered) males. A female can go into heat as early as four months of age. Every cat is affected differently.</p><p>The traditional age to spay a cat has been around six months of age, however, research in the past 20 years reveals there may be advantages to spaying before the first heat cycle. Now we will discuss the benefits of spaying whether it happens early or later in a cat's life, the spaying process, what to expect after the procedure, and some concerns owners may have afterward.</p><h2>What Are the Benefits?</h2><p>Spaying is an important part of cat ownership and to a female cat's overall health. The benefits of spaying far outweigh the risks. Benefits include the prevention of mammary cancer (when spayed early), reducing the number of unwanted kittens, preventing noisy and sometimes irritating heat cycles, and possibly urine marking in the house.</p><h2>The Spay Process</h2><p>Although spaying is considered to be major surgery, it is one of the most common procedures performed. Before spaying, your veterinarian will perform a head-to-paw exam, and may suggest bloodwork to ensure all vital organs are in good working order. Spays are performed under general anesthesia. To prepare for anesthesia, a sedative and pain medication will be given. Once drowsy, an injection will be given to induce a deeper sleep. During this time, she is not aware of what is happening and feels no pain. Your cat will then be intubated, meaning a tube placed in her trachea is connected to a machine that helps her breathe. Most veterinarians will also place a catheter in the vein to administer fluids.</p><p>Your cat will then be connected to a machine that monitors her heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen levels, and temperature. She will be given heat support to help maintain body temperature, and the surgical area is clipped and cleaned. An incision is made, just below where the belly button in a human would be. The incision extended down the abdomen, but the length depends on different variables. The ovaries and uterus are removed, and the cervix is tied off. Though it is standard to remove the ovaries and uterus, some veterinarians may leave the uterus intact. Remember, it is the ovaries that are responsible for the heat cycles, possible mammary tumor development, and behavior problems.</p><p>Once the vet confirms there is no bleeding, the incision will be closed. Sutures are placed to close the abdominal cavity and then either skin sutures, skin staples, or skin glue are used to close the top skin. When the procedure is finished, the tube helping your cat breathe will be removed. She will be closely monitored by the veterinary team until sent home. If your cat has sutures or staples placed, you will return to have them removed, typically within 10 to 14 days after the procedure.</p><h2>What to Expect After the Spay</h2><p>Some veterinarians choose to keep a newly spayed cat overnight, to minimize their movement. If the spay is done in the morning, the cat may be ready to go home the same day. In either case, your cat may be a little groggy the first night, and may not be interested in eating. This is a normal reaction. They should be more alert the next day. Their appetite should also return to normal within a day or two.</p><p>Some cats experience some soreness the first few days after the procedure, so pain medication is typically sent home. It is not unusual for owners to see discharge coming from the incision site. When this is noted, it is important to have this assessed by your veterinarian. Some cats may require additional treatments like antibiotics. An Elizabethan collar may be sent home, to keep them from licking which may cause irritation, infection, and sometimes opening of the incision site.</p><h2>Owner Concerns After the Spay</h2><h3>Is My Cat Going to Gain Weight?</h3><p>Estrogens are a natural appetite suppressant. When a cat is spayed and estrogens are removed, there may be an increase in appetite. Also, spaying has been known to slow down a cat's metabolism. Your veterinarian will help to determine whether a change in diet and exercise level is necessary.</p><h3>Can My Spayed Cat Still Be in Heat?</h3><p>Without ovaries, a cat is unable to go into heat. However, ovarian tissue sometimes extends down the ovarian ligament. This, unfortunately, is not visible to the naked eye. When this occurs, ovarian tissue can be left behind, resulting in a cat showing signs of heat. The cat is unable to become pregnant since the uterus has been removed, but it is still important for the veterinarian to determine if an ovarian remnant is present to prevent other issues from occurring. Diagnosis can be done through blood testing and exploratory surgery will likely be needed to remove the ovarian remnant tissue.</p>",834
124,https://www.thesprucepets.com/so-your-cat-is-pregnant-552392,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>Should You Spay a Pregnant Cat?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Spay a Pregnant Cat?</h1><p>So you were a little slow in having her spayed and your cat turned up pregnant. Or, perhaps a pregnant stray adopted you. Maybe you are working with a rescue group and this is your first fostering experience with a pregnant cat. Where do you go from here?</p><p>Your first major decision is whether or not to allow the pregnancy to continue. Pregnant cats (called queens) can be spayed, but the decision depends on a number of factors, which you should discuss with your veterinarian and your family.</p><h2>Should Pregnant Cats Be Spayed?</h2><p>Spaying a pregnant cat includes , a word that evokes a variety of emotions. Proponents don't like having to take lives of unborn kittens, but their position is based on pragmatic reasoning. Opponents simply do not like the taking of lives under any circumstances, whether born or unborn.</p><h3>Spaying Helps Overpopulation</h3><p>Many animal shelters automatically spay a pregnant cat that comes into the shelter. Some no-kill shelters allow the mother cat to give birth, especially if the pregnancy is late-term. There are some rescue groups that opt to never spay a rescued pregnant cat.</p><p>The enormous cat overpopulation problem is partially caused by cat owners' failure to spay or neuter their cats. Unspayed cats that spend time outside are highly likely to become pregnant. Whether owned, stray, or feral, these cats and their surviving kittens continue to mate, and the offspring from those matings continue to mate. Unspayed females can become pregnant by one or more of their non-neutered male kittens. A pregnant female cat and her descendants can account for the births of several hundred kittens in just a few years.</p><h3>Spaying Can Help Animal Rescue Groups</h3><p>Animal rescue groups, humane societies, and TNR (trap-neuter-release) groups are overwhelmed in trying to control cat overpopulation, and ""kitten season,"" which extends for a long part of each year in many geographical areas, is met with dread by these groups. They know this year's kitten crop will be responsible for the deaths of last year's kittens or older cats at shelters. There simply isn't enough space to house them all, and something must give. It's a matter of supply and demand and young kittens are in the highest demand.</p><p>Spaying a rescued pregnant cat can help contain the overpopulation problem. There are simply too few homes for the huge number of homeless cats. Preventing an unplanned litter may also help prevent the deaths of living cats and kittens. Even when a pregnant female cat is adopted by the finder, and there are good homes waiting for her kittens, some people view each of those kittens as being indirectly responsible for the death of a shelter cat or kitten that might have been adopted into one of those homes.</p><p>Of course, there is no evidence that the people who plan to adopt the mother and/or kittens would have gone to the shelter instead. Perhaps they weren't even looking for a cat until they heard a friend, neighbor, or co-worker had adoptable kittens. An individual who is willing to keep both the mother cat and the kittens or find good, permanent homes for them, should not be made to feel guilty for allowing the birth. Of course the mother cat and her kittens should be spayed and neutered as soon as possible.</p><h3>Pregnancy Can Be Hard on the Queen</h3><p>If the pregnant cat is very young, very old, or in poor health, pregnancy can cause even more health problems. Sometimes, the kindest and most compassionate action anyone could take with one of these cats is to spay her and abort her litter.</p><h2>Caring for a Pregnant Cat</h2><p>If you've decided to let your queen have her kittens, you likely have a number of questions about how to take care of your pregnant cat. A good place to start is with your veterinarian. Your main responsibility will be to feed a high-quality diet formulated for growth and to maintain a comfortable and safe environment for your pregnant cat.</p><p>A queen's gestation period typically runs from 65 to 67 days, but can be highly variable. By the time you notice she is pregnant, she'll likely be at least three weeks along. By six weeks, the pregnancy becomes more apparent. At this time, your vet can take an x-ray to count the number of fetuses. Litters can range from one to eight or more kittens, with an average of two to five kittens, with maximum numbers occurring with queens between the ages of two and eight.</p><p>It's helpful to know how many kittens are expected before the mother cat gives birth. A veterinarian can provide an estimated number of kittens based on a radiograph or an ultrasound. Although your cat is unlikely to need your help during labor and birth, complications can occasionally arise. You will be able to tell if she is in distress between kitten births if you know how many are expected. You can watch her give birth from a safe distance, only intervening if there's a problem.</p>",826
125,https://www.thesprucepets.com/helping-pregnant-cat-during-birthing-555410,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>Helping a Pregnant Cat During Labor</h1>,"<h1>Helping a Pregnant Cat During Labor</h1><p>If you have a pregnant cat (queen), and it looks like she is ready to birth her kittens (queening), chances are that you will not need to do anything except encourage her. You may even wake one morning to discover that your cat has given birth during the night and is comfortably nursing her kittens.</p><p>Although nature has a way of taking care of itself, you should know how to spot potential problems while your cat is in labor and what you might need to do to help.</p><h2>Signs of Impending Labor</h2><p>The duration of a cat pregnancy is roughly 65 days, give or take five days. If you are not so sure how far along your cat is, review the telltale signs that birth is imminent.</p><h2>Supplies for the Birthing</h2><p>Your cat might want to hide to give birth. However, you can prepare a birthing area, such as a cardboard box or laundry basket lined with towels or blankets. If the cat uses this spot, it will be easier for you to observe and attend to the birth.</p><h2>The Kitten Birthing Process</h2><p>The trigger for the birth process is unknown, but factors include the size and weight of the uterus, size and weight of the fetuses, and the hormonal balances of the fetuses and the queen.</p><p>During the birth process, rhythmical uterine contractions gradually increase to push the fetus out of the uterus and into the birth canal.</p><p>The birth of one kitten can take anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes. The kittens are born within their amniotic sacs, which the queen will remove. The mother cat will stimulate the kittens to breathe by washing them with her rough tongue. She will also sever the umbilical cord by chewing on it approximately one inch from the kitten's body. She may also eat the placenta. The kittens will immediately gravitate toward a nipple, latch on, and nurse.</p><p>If the mother cat ignores the kitten and it is still in its sac, you will need to carefully cut or tear the membrane pouch and stimulate the kitten's breathing by rubbing its nose and mouth gently with a rough, dry towel. If the mother cat has difficulty biting off the umbilical cord, tightly knot dental floss around the umbilical cord 1 inch from the kitten's body and cut the umbilical cord on the mother's side of the tie.</p><p>If a placenta does not come out with each of the kittens, make sure it expels within 24 hours after birth. Each kitten should have one placenta. It is a good idea to count the placentas. If the placenta remains in the cat, you will need to see a veterinarian.</p><p>About 30 to 60 minutes may pass between births, but more prolonged periods are not uncommon. If there is a delay of over 4-6 hours and you are sure there are remaining kittens, the queen needs examination by a veterinarian. Whether the birth went smoothly or not, the mother cat and kittens should be examined by your veterinarian within 24 hours of birthing.</p><h2>Length of Time for the Total Birth Process</h2><p>It takes, on average, half a day for a queen to give birth to all her kittens. The first kitten should arrive within an hour of the start of active labor.</p><p>In between kittens, the mother cat will rest and should be allowed to nurse and clean the kittens that were born. If you have been keeping the kittens in another box, move them back with the mother cat and help them find a nipple. A break in birthing is a good time for you to offer her food, kitten milk replacement, or plain, unflavored yogurt.</p><p>If you think the mother hasn't birthed all the kittens after 12 hours, contact an open veterinarian.</p><h2>Problems During Labor</h2><p>Fortunately, most queens can deliver their kittens without human intervention. However, some complications may occur.</p><p>Once all the kittens are born, your queen should be caring for and feeding them. During nursing, your cat's caloric needs will increase greatly. Make sure she has ample kitten formula food. A high-quality kitten formula will meet your cat's high-energy nutritional needs.</p><p>If your cat is not nursing or eating, seems to be in pain or is lethargic, something is not right. Also, a foul odor along with frequent bleeding indicates an infection or retained kitten. If this is happening to your cat, seek immediate veterinary care.</p><p>Feline labor takes from two to six hours.</p><p>The mama cat can get spayed once her kittens have weaned themselves, when they are five to six weeks old.</p><p>Give your cat a safe and warm place to give birth. Create a nest in a box full of warm blankets and towels that are washable. Place her food, water, and litter nearby.</p>",779
126,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-that-your-cat-is-in-heat-3385392,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Reproductive Health,<h1>Signs Your Cat Is in Heat</h1>,"<h1>Signs Your Cat Is in Heat</h1><p>There are typical signs a cat is in heat that all people in possession of an unspayed cat should know. All female cats will naturally go through a heat cycle if they have not been spayed. This heat cycle is referred to as estrous and it indicates that a cat is capable of breeding. There are a few key indications that a cat may be in heat. Knowing the typical signs a cat is in heat helps you to know what behavior can be expected and what behavior is more unusual and not related to the heat cycle at all.</p><h2>What Is a Heat Cycle for a Cat?</h2><p>An unspayed female cat is called a queen and has reproductive organs that include a uterus and ovaries. These reproductive organs go through a normal cycle, called an estrous or more commonly a heat cycle, that allows reproduction to occur. During a heat cycle in most mammals, an egg is released from the ovaries prior to breeding and this is called ovulation. But since cats are induced ovulators they don't release eggs during estrous until they breed. They do, however, still have hormonal fluctuations, along with some blood vessel engorgement, during a heat cycle that means their body is telling them it's time to breed.</p><h3>5 Key Signs Your Cat Is in Heat</h3><h2>When Do Cats Go Into Heat?</h2><p>Female cats naturally go into their first heat cycle at about six months of age, but it may occur anywhere between four and 12 months of age depending on a cat's breed, health, and the time of year. This first heat cycle is associated with puberty and a cat can get pregnant during any of its heat cycles, including the first one. Cats are seasonally polyestrous which means they go into heat on a seasonal schedule, typically February through October in the Northern Hemisphere.</p><h2>How Long Does a Cat Stay In Heat?</h2><p>A cat is usually in heat for about a week and if it doesn't mate, it will go out of heat and then come back into heat again a week or so later. This can occur throughout the breeding season.</p><h2>Cat Heat Cycle Symptoms</h2><p>Unlike a dog, cats do not show very obvious physical signs when they are in heat. Behavioral signs are more the norm for a cat.</p><h3>Signs a Cat Is In Heat</h3><p>The first thing most people notice about a cat in heat is how much it vocalizes. Crying, meowing, and yowling are all often loudly heard from a cat in heat. These vocalizations are to get attention and let other cats know that they are in heat.</p><p>In addition to the noises, a cat in heat will also seek out attention and affection from its owner and other people. They love to be pet and stroked, especially down their backs and hindquarters. When pet, a cat in heat will often wiggle its hind end, its legs may tap dance, and its tail will be held high into the air. It may also rub its face on its owner and furniture excessively to spread its scent.</p><p>Other signs that a cat is in heat include it rolling on the floor, begging to go outside (even if it is an indoor-only cat) by scratching at the door and even spraying urine. A cat will back up to a wall or other vertical object, wiggle its hind end, and spray urine to let other cats know it is in heat. A rush in hormones during the heat cycle causes a cat to have all these exaggerated behaviors and they stop once a cat is no longer in heat.</p><h2>What To Do When a Cat Is in Heat</h2><p>If you have a cat that is in heat, the attention-seeking behavior can be annoying and persistent. Breeding a cat in heat will, of course, stop the cycle but then pregnancy is likely to result which will potentially leave you with even more cats that will come into heat. Getting a cat spayed is the best way to prevent or eliminate these unwanted behaviors. This will of course also ensure the cat never goes into heat again and avoids the unwanted behaviors that go along with it. Some veterinarians will want to wait until the current heat cycle has finished due to the increased risk of surgical bleeding while others will spay a cat while actively in heat.</p>",725
127,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-is-my-cat-sneezing-552176,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Sneezing in Cats and Kittens</h1>,"<h1>Sneezing in Cats and Kittens</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Jeanne Grunert</p><p>Just like people, kittens and cats sneeze for a variety of reasons. An occasional sneeze isn't a symptom of a serious feline health problem, and it often has to do with environmental allergens or irritants that can easily be managed. However, constant sneezing (especially when accompanied by nasal discharge, lethargy, or lack of appetite) could indicate that another illness is present.</p><p>If your kitten is sneezing, you may worry that something is wrong. The good news is that there are many normal reasons for a mildly sneezing kitten. Excessive or moderate and severe sneezing should always be checked out by a veterinarian, as respiratory problems and other diseases can lead to infections when left untreated.</p><h2>What Is Sneezing?</h2><p>Sneezing is the body's means of removing irritants to the sinuses, and it can mean different things for cats and kittens depending on the consistency. If you notice your kitten sneezing now and then, there's a good chance that it's just reacting to some dust or fur that's tickled its nose. Remember that kittens' noses are just inches from the floor, so if your floor is dusty, you may notice a fair amount of sneezing. There's a simple cure for this issue: Dust and vacuum your floors a bit more frequently and see if the sneezing resolves.</p><p>If your kitten has more than just a mild sneeze, possible reasons include allergies, upper respiratory diseases, and more. Foreign objects can also be stuck in your pet's nose without you knowing. In either case, it's important to visit your veterinarian for cases of excessive sneezing to determine whether another problem is the cause.</p><h2>Symptoms of Sneezing in Cats and Kittens</h2><p>Sneezing is not an actual disease, but it can be a symptom of other health conditions that may appear alongside other symptoms.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Nasal Congestion and Discharge</h3><p>Excessive sneezing can occur in addition to symptoms like nasal congestion and discharge, typically related to a feline upper respiratory infection (URI). These symptoms usually take between 2 and 10 days to develop after the cat was exposed to an infectious agent.</p><h3>Lethargy or Loss of Appetite</h3><p>In addition to excessive sneezing, your cat may also act lethargic or lose its appetite (often related to upper respiratory infections). This can lead to anorexia or significant weight loss in cats, so it's important to visit your veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h3>Excessive Blinking or Inflammation of the Eyes</h3><p>If your cat is sneezing very often and also experiencing excessive blinking or inflammation around the eyes, it may have feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR). If these signs are noticed at the same time, your cat should be examined by a veterinarian to begin diagnosis.</p><h2>Causes of Sneezing</h2><h3>Cat Allergies</h3><p>Just like people and other pets, many cats and kittens have allergies. Mold, dust, perfumes, smoke, pesticides, and cleaning supplies can all trigger sneezing. If you think your kitten has an allergy, it's likely reacting to something in the air. You can work to reduce potential allergens in your home, especially in areas where the kitten spends a lot of time, but if your cat's sneezing is more than mild, it's important to visit the vet. There are a variety of treatment options to help cats with allergies.</p><h3>Polyps, Tumors, or Foreign Objects in the Nasal Cavity</h3><p>Any object or tissue that is not normally present in the nasal cavity can cause sneezing. Your veterinarian can check for and safely remove foreign objects, which may require sedation, nasal flushing, and/or endoscopy. In some cases, your cat may have a nasal polyp or tumor, which should be treated by your veterinarian and tested to rule out other conditions.</p><h3>Feline Upper Respiratory Infections</h3><p>Upper respiratory infections (URI) in cats cause excessive sneezing, and they're often highly contagious to other cats. If you bring a new kitten home with signs of an upper respiratory infection or another illness, it is important to prevent them from socializing with the other cats in the household until the vet has cleared them and their symptoms have resolved.</p><p>URIs can sometimes be considered chronic and stay with your cat for life. Thankfully, symptoms typically only present for a few weeks when the virus is reactivated (often due to stress), and your cat can usually live a comfortable life despite the reoccurrence of symptoms from time to time.</p><p>Constant sneezing, especially when accompanied by other symptoms (such as lethargy, lack of appetite, eye or nasal discharge, diarrhea, coughing, or breathing difficulties) can also be a sign of viral, bacterial, or fungal upper respiratory infections. If you see these symptoms, you may have a kitten with an illness such as feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).</p><h3>Feline Viral Rhinotracheitis (FVR)</h3><p>Also known as feline herpes virus, feline viral rhinotracheitis (FVR) typically affects the cat's nose, throat, and eyes. Sneezing, nasal congestion, excessive blinking, and discharge from the eyes or nose are all common signs in cats with FVR, so it's possible that your cat's sneezing is caused by this disease (especially when seen with other symptoms).</p><h3>Calicivirus</h3><p>One fairly common and highly contagious disease that can cause sneezing and breathing issues is feline calicivirus (FCV). Most vets vaccinate kittens so they won't catch this disease, but if they do, it can range from mild to severe. There are, however, several dangerous strains of calicivirus that may affect your cat, so it's important to have your pet checked and treated for any symptoms.</p><h3>Infected Teeth</h3><p>Cats with infected teeth may sneeze when they eat because the roots of their teeth are close to their nasal passages. If this is the case, your cat should see a veterinarian as soon as possible. Dental infections can be life-threatening when left untreated for long periods of time, as problems in the teeth can lead to septic infections.</p><h2>Diagnosing Sneezing in Cats and Kittens</h2><p>If your cat or kitten is sneezing excessively, your veterinarian will obtain its full medical history along with performing a physical examination. Learning about your cat's history at home will also help them determine possible causes before further testing, especially if your cat has been in contact with others that may carry certain diseases that lead to this symptom.</p><p>Your veterinarian can also perform diagnostic testing (including nasal swabs, radiographs, a nasal flush, or a rhinoscopy) to screen your cat's overall health and rule out other possible causes to find the specific reason for your cat's sneezing.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If the symptoms are more than mild or if your kitten sneezes blood, take it to your veterinarian as soon as possible. They may prescribe an anti-viral treatment, nasal decongestant, or antibiotics depending on what's causing the sneezing. A humidifier near your cat's sleeping area may also help with minor breathing issues.</p><p>In some cases, the vet may prescribe steroid treatment. However, after other treatment options have been exhausted, a severe case may require surgery to remove whatever is compromising your cat's breathing.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Excessive Sneezing</h2><p>Since there are a variety of reasons that your cat could be sneezing excessively, the prognosis for your specific cat will depend on your veterinarian's diagnosis. Thankfully, most issues that cause cats to sneeze consistently are not life-threatening, but preventing and treating any infections is key. Your veterinarian will recommend appropriate treatment options with a more detailed prognosis based on any other symptoms your cat is experiencing.</p>",1193

Perkins, DVM is an accomplished veterinary expert with two decades of hands-on small animal clinical experience in private practice and shelters. She founded the award-winning mobile veterinary practice, ""The Housecall Vet,"" and co-founded a small animal and exotics hospital.</p><p>An ear hematoma is a pool of leaked blood that gathers underneath the skin, causing painful swelling and redness. Dogs frequently develop hematomas in the flaps of their ears. Ear flaps, also called pinna, are the outer portion of the ear connected to the sides or the top of your dog's head. Ear hematomas, also called aural hematomas, are usually caused by excessive head shaking or scratching due to an ear infection, mites, allergies, or other irritation inside the ear canal. The vigorous head shaking can cause a blood vessel inside the ear flap to break, which leads to the swelling.</p><p>While any dog can develop an ear hematoma, the condition is most common in dogs with floppy ears, such as Basset hounds, Cocker spaniels, and dachshunds, as head shaking in these dogs causes the ears to slap against the side of the head, leading to trauma.</p><p>An ear hematoma can cause the ear flap to partially or completely fill up with blood, giving the ear an inflated appearance. If the swelling is large enough, it can cover the opening of the ear canal. The extra weight of the ear flap can cause some discomfort, and may also lead to a permanent change in the carriage of the ears. Ear hematomas usually occur in just one ear but occasionally affect both ears.</p><h2>What Is an Ear Hematoma?</h2><p>Because ear flaps are very thin, there isn't much room for pooled blood should a blood vessel break underneath the skin. Consequently, the blood tends to create a pocket of swelling that can become large enough to affect the entire outer ear. You'll notice that your dog's ear looks swollen like a balloon, and the affected ear might droop more than the normal ear. Ear hematomas can feel squishy or firm, depending on the amount of swelling. They are very painful, and your dog will likely object to you touching the swollen ear.</p><h2>Symptoms of an Ear Hematoma in a Dog</h2><p>The main symptom of an ear hematoma is the swelling, which can become quite extensive. Because the hematoma is often due to an underlying ear infection, your dog will likely show a variety of symptoms due to the pain and irritation of both the hematoma and the infection.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Ear hematomas can be small and only affect a portion of the ear flap or can become large enough so the entire ear flap is swollen. The weight of the swelling can cause the affected ear to droop lower than usual, and the pain might cause your dog to scratch at the ear or shake its head in an effort to relieve the discomfort. Often, the dog will sit with its head tilted towards the affected side, as that ear feels heavier than the healthy ear. If the ear is infected, as is usually the case with ear hematomas, you will probably notice signs of infection inside the ear, including excessive ear wax, black or yellowish crusts or spots of debris, and a foul odor.</p><h2>Causes of Ear Hematomas</h2><p>Ear hematomas are created by a broken blood vessel inside the ear flap. This leads to bleeding underneath the skin. Because the tissue of the ear flap is thin, the blood doesn't have much room to spread out, so it tends to pool, leading to a swollen, balloon-like appearance of the ear.</p><p>The most common cause of ear hematomas is excessive head shaking due to an ear infection, allergies, or a foreign object inside the ear. Occasionally, however, your dog might develop a hematoma after a trauma to the ear, such as a bite from another dog or even an overly vigorous play session. And dogs with blood-clotting disorders are also more prone to developing hematomas, even without prior trauma or infection.</p><h2>Diagnosing Ear Hematomas in Dogs</h2><p>Due to the distinctive appearance of an ear hematoma, the diagnosis is generally quite straightforward. Your veterinarian will generally diagnose the hematoma simply by visual inspection, but will be more concerned with the underlying cause. Thus, the vet will examine the inside of your dog's ears to see if there are signs of infection, allergies, or a foreign object stuck inside the ear canal. The vet might swab inside the ear and examine the specimen underneath a microscope, which can reveal bacteria or yeast.</p><p>Sometimes, your vet will recommend further diagnostic procedures, including needle aspiration of the fluid inside the hematoma to be certain it's just blood. And blood tests to assess your dog's overall health are often also ordered.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Sometimes an ear hematoma is so small that it may not need to be repaired. Left alone, the blood inside a small hematoma will eventually reabsorb. There is a risk, however, that an untreated hematoma, even if small, can leave your dog with a permanently scarred or deformed ear. That's why all hematomas should be assessed by a veterinarian, who will also provide pain medications and treatment for any underlying ear infection. Your vet will prescribe antibiotic drops for the dog's ears,<br />and may also give an injection of antibiotics to start the healing as quickly as possible.</p><h3>Aspiration</h3><p>This procedure involves using a needle attached to a syringe to remove fluid from the hematoma. However, the fluid will eventually return, sometimes within days, making this a temporary solution. It can also lead to infection within the ear flap. Still, some owners may prefer this method because it can provide instant relief and does not require surgery, making it the less expensive option. Instilling a steroid into the dead space can make this method more successful. A low dose of oral steroids may also be helpful.</p><h3>Pie-Crusting Sutures</h3><p>Here, an incision is made in the ear flap surgically. The hematoma is drained of fluid and blood clots. Multiple sutures are placed in the hematoma area in a quilt-like pattern to prevent it from refilling. Usually, a small tube is left in place to serve as a drain for fluids as the area heals, and often tight bandages are applied over the ear to help reduce swelling. Sutures are typically left in place for up to three weeks to prevent recurrence of the hematoma.</p><h3>Teat Cannula Placement</h3><p>A teat cannula is a small device used in the treatment of udder inflammation in cattle. These cannulas can also be surgically placed in a dog 's ear hematoma if the ear flap is large enough to accommodate it. The hematoma is drained of fluids and allowed to heal over several weeks. This method is generally successful, but the dog must tolerate the discomfort of the cannula in the ear flap while it drains fluid.</p><h2>Prognosis for Dogs With Ear Hematomas</h2><p>Most dogs recover from an ear hematoma without any problems, as long as the underlying infection is treated and surgical procedures, if required, are carried out promptly. However, leaving an ear hematoma untreated can lead to permanent scarring or disfigurement of the ear.</p><h2>How to Prevent Ear Hematomas</h2><p>Because ear hematomas are most often caused by head-shaking due to an an ear infection, the best prevention is to take steps to ward off possible ear infections before they become severe. Regular inspections of your dog's ears are helpful; look for signs of trouble such as excessive wax, crusty debris, redness, or odor.</p>",1233
129,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-eats-and-throws-up-5070200,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Why Is My Cat Throwing Up Its Food?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is My Cat Throwing Up Its Food?</h1> <p>Nandini Balial is a writer and fact checker specializing in a variety of lifestyle topics, including film/TV, literature, and feminism, with work appearing in Slate, Wired, Pacific Standard, and more prestigious outlets.</p><p>Vomiting is considered to be a nonspecific symptom. It could be associated with an array of health concerns. If your cat vomits undigested food, it can be a sign of a serious illness. Some of these can include things like hairballs, internal obstructions, pancreatitis, eating too quickly, constipation, indigestion, parasitic infections, poisoning, stress, depression, or even anxiety. It's essential to know the specific reason why your feline is throwing up its food and ways you can treat it before seeking veterinary help, if serious.</p><h2>What Is the Difference Between Vomiting and Regurgitation?</h2><p>Vomiting is not always vomiting; sometimes it is actually regurgitation, and knowing the difference can be helpful information for your veterinarian to help diagnose the cause. Regurgitation is often mistaken for vomiting, but unlike vomited food, regurgitated food has not yet been digested by stomach acids.</p><h3>What is Vomiting?</h3><p>Vomiting is when the contents of the stomach, including food, water, and/or bile, are ejected. Vomiting is an active process typically accompanied by nausea, retching, and contraction of the abdominal muscles (heaving). The cat will often vocalize, drool, or begin retching prior to vomiting.</p><p>Regurgitation, on the other hand, involves only the contents of the mouth or esophagus. Food and/or water or other ingested items do not make it to the stomach before they come back up, and there is no abdominal effort. Regurgitation is a passive process in which there is no vocalizing or retching: the cat just lowers its head and food, or other materials, fall out. Regurgitation often happens within 30 minutes to two hours after eating.</p><h2>Common Causes of Your Cat Vomiting or Regurgitating</h2><h3>Your Cat Is Eating Too Fast</h3><p>Some cats may eat too quickly and this can cause them to regurgitate undigested food. Feeding your cat out of a food puzzle toy can help to slow them down. Food puzzles are a great source of both play and enrichment for your cat. There are more and more manufactured food puzzles available on the market that stimulate both your cat's predatory and foraging instincts. The added benefit of food puzzles for a cat that chronically vomits its food, though, is that it slows down the chow time so that a cat can't eat too quickly and then get sick from it. If your cat routinely eats out of puzzle feeders and is still vomiting up its food, talk to your veterinarian.</p><h3>Food Allergies</h3><p>Some cats may eat too fast, as stated above, or have a food allergy. If your cat is a habitual 'scarf and barf' cat, or if they have intestinal sensitivities, that may be causing them to vomit up partially digested or undigested food. If your vet has ruled out other medical issues and thinks that what your cat is vomiting up is actually food, they may want you to try a commercial, sensitive systems food with your cat.</p><p>When it comes to food allergies, most cats are actually allergic to protein versus any other nutrient source. A hydrolyzed diet is a food that has gone through a process where the protein is broken down into its individual amino acid components. This prevents your cat's immune system from identifying the food as containing an allergen and prevents your cat from having symptoms of an allergy flare-up.</p><h3>Hairballs</h3><p>Cats are naturally meticulously clean animals and groom themselves for a large part of their day. As your cat grooms themselves, tiny hook-like structures on their tongue catch loose and dead hair, which is then swallowed. The majority of the hair passes all the way through the digestive tract with no problems, but sometimes the hair stays in the stomach and forms a hairball.</p><p>Hairballs can contribute to or cause a cat to vomit up undigested food. Although a cat vomiting a hairball occasionally can be normal and not a concern, it is important to note that hairballs should not be frequent, painful, or difficult for your cat to pass. To help prevent hairballs in your cat, there are over-the-counter dietary supplements, in either chew or gel forms.</p><h3>Food and Dietary Changes</h3><p>Your cat may eat too quickly, and this can cause regurgitation of undigested food. A cat vomiting due to eating too much is less likely but feeding your cat smaller and more frequent meals may help. You should also talk to your veterinarian about how much you feed to verify your cat is not being fed too much and is getting the nutrition they need.</p><h3>Gastritis</h3><p>If your cat is one to get into things they shouldn't, it is possible that they have irritated their stomach with something that they have eaten. When this happens, you may see vomiting undigested food in addition to vomiting blood and/or bile. Your cat may also be exhibiting a decrease in appetite, a depressed attitude, lethargy, or dehydration. Your vet will know just what to do if your cat is vomiting because of gastritis.</p><h2>What Should You Do If Your Cat Is Vomiting Undigested Food?</h2><p>Some cat owners may describe their cat as 'puke-y', but it should be noted that frequent vomiting is never normal for a cat. Vomiting more than once a week is definitely a sign of a problem. If your cat is vomiting up undigested food, begin to feed with puzzle toys and/or feed them smaller amounts more frequently. If you continue to notice your cat is vomiting undigested several times and/or in conjunction with other symptoms such as lack of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, or diarrhea, you should make an appointment with your vet right away.</p><p>Your vet will want to start with a physical exam, checking your cat's vital signs, and palpating your cat's abdomen. After a thorough examination, your vet may also want to run some tests, including checking a fecal sample, blood work and X-rays. A fecal sample can be screened for microscopic signs of intestinal parasites. Blood work will check your cat's organ function, making sure that there are no signs of liver disease or kidney disease, as well as your cat's red blood cell and platelet levels. An X-ray study will check for any fluid in the abdomen that could potentially be blood and it may also show intestinal gas patterns that could be indicative of a blockage.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Depending on what your doctor finds, your cat may require hospitalization for fluid therapy and supportive care, or they may just need outpatient treatments and oral medications to go home on. If your vet suspects your cat has an intestinal blockage your cat may require surgery to remove whatever the blockage is.</p><h2>How to Prevent Vomiting in Cats</h2><p>Depending on why your cat is vomiting, there are a few things you can do to prevent it. If your cat is eating too quickly, feeding them smaller meals more often may help. You should also talk to your veterinarian about verifying your cat is not being fed too much and is getting the nutrition they need. If the vomiting is due to a hairball, try over-the-counter dietary supplements, in either chew or gel forms and a regular brushing schedule. If you suspect food allergies, talk with your vet about a special diet.</p>",1205
130,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-do-if-your-cat-is-losing-weight-4689001,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Why Is My Cat Losing Weight?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is My Cat Losing Weight?</h1><p>Is your cat losing weight? Unintended weight loss is usually a sign of an underlying health problem. Many owners think that weight loss is normal for senior cats, but this is not the case. It's important to take action if you notice unexplained weight loss in your cat.</p><h2>How to Tell if Your Cat is Losing Weight</h2><p>It is hard to tell if your cat is really losing weight if it happens gradually. If your cat has a lot of hair or used to be slightly overweight, then it can be harder to tell when weight loss has occurred. Sometimes, owners notice a cat has lost weight when they pick them up and they feel lighter. Other times they have pictures they can look at our can feel that they have lost weight when petting them.</p><p>To assess your cat's body condition, start by looking at your cat's body from above. At an ideal weight, there should be a tuck at the waist that is noticeable but not extreme. Next, run your hands along your cat's sides. The ribs should be palpable with a thin covering of fat. If the ribs feel very prominent and are visible, your cat is likely underweight.</p><h2>What Causes Cats to Lose Weight?</h2><p>In many cases, cats lose weight when they are not eating enough. However, some diseases cause weight loss despite adequate food intake. Depending on the cause, weight loss may or may not accompany other signs of illness. Many health problems can cause weight loss in cats, some more serious than others.</p><h2>Hyperthyroidism</h2><p>Hyperthyroidism is a relatively common illness that most often affects older cats. Cats with hyperthyroidism produce too much thyroid hormone due to an enlargement of the thyroid gland. This enlargement is usually caused by a benign tumor that grows on the thyroid.</p><p>Common signs of hyperthyroidism include weight loss, increased appetite, and increased thirst and urination. Some cats also experience vomiting, diarrhea, and hyperactivity. Some will vocalize and act restless. Cats with hyperthyroidism may have coats that appear unkempt and greasy. Hyperthyroidism is treated with radioactive iodine or oral medications.</p><h2>Chronic Kidney Disease</h2><p>Chronic kidney disease is one of the most common illnesses seen in senior cats. The kidneys produce important hormones, filter out wastes from the blood, help regulate blood pressure, and facilitate the production of new red blood cells. When a cat's kidneys stop functioning properly, it leads to a variety of other issues.</p><p>Increased thirst and urination are among the first signs noticed when a cat has kidney issues, followed by loss of appetite, weight loss, and lethargy. Chronic kidney disease cannot be cured, often be medically managed with medication, diet change, and fluid supplementation.</p><h3>Diabetes</h3><p>Diabetes mellitus is another common ailment that can affect cats. This endocrine disorder affects the ability of the pancreas to produce insulin, a hormone needed to regulate blood glucose.</p><p>Signs of diabetes include weight loss, increased appetite, thirst, and urination, and lethargy. Diabetes is typically managed with insulin and a diet change. Other medications may be used. Some cats will even revert back to normal after several months of treatment.</p><h2>Gastrointestinal Problems</h2><p>Any issue in the GI tract can affect a cat's weight. First, GI problems can reduce appetite. Second, some issues prevent the GI tract from properly digesting food and absorbing nutrients, leading to weight loss. Some GI problems seen in cats include intestinal parasites, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, and other pancreatic issues, and even cancers of the GI tract.</p><p>GI issues may cause loss of appetite, weight loss, vomiting, diarrhea, lethargy, and more. Treatment of GI parasites may be as simple as deworming the cat. Other GI issues typically require medications and supportive care.</p><h2>Dental Problems</h2><p>Oral and dental issues can cause extreme pain, decreasing appetite and leading to weight loss. Common dental problems in cats include periodontal disease, resorptive lesions, and tooth fractures. Some cats develop stomatitis, a painful inflammation of a cat's mouth and gums that may be immune-mediated.</p><p>Signs of dental issues include bad breath, drooling, pawing at the mouth, or even oral bleeding. The first step to treatment is for the vet to put your cat under anesthesia and do a professional dental cleaning, exam, and treatment as necessary. Some cats will need oral surgery and/or tooth extractions.</p><h2>Cancer</h2><p>Like people, cats can get cancer just about anywhere in their body. Cancer may or may not be seen in the form of a tumor. Lymphoma is one of the common cancers seen in cats and it can live in the GI tract, mouth, lymphatic system, and more. Most forms of cancer will eventually cause general malaise, lethargy, pain, muscle wasting, appetite loss, and overall weight loss.</p><h2>Stress</h2><p>Cats can be very sensitive to changes in their home. Because they are often excellent at hiding outward signs of stress, they can experience bigger symptoms later on. Any environmental stressors can lead to anxiety and stress in your cat. Reduced appetite is a common sign of stress and will eventually lead to weight loss.</p><p>There are a number of other health issues that can lead to weight loss. If your cat has an underlying health issue, you may or may not notice other signs of illness. In addition, many diseases have similar symptoms, so diagnosis requires a veterinarian.</p><h2>Treatment for Weight Loss in Cats</h2><p>The treatment for weight loss in cats depends on the cause. If you notice your cat is losing weight, your first step should be to schedule a vet appointment. Your vet will do a physical exam first. Next, lab tests and/or x-rays or imaging may be needed to determine the problem. Based on the findings, your vet may recommend medication, diet change, surgery, or other treatment.</p><p>If your vet gives your cat a clean bill of health, then the weight loss may be caused by inadequate food intake or some unknown or undetectable condition. Ask your vet for advice about feeding and environmental enrichment. If you can determine a source of stress for your cat, start by working to reduce that stress. Your vet can also recommend a diet that is right in nutrients and calories, potentially helping your cat gain weight.</p><p>If your cat's weight loss continues despite changes you make, then make sure to follow up with your vet about it. Your vet may refer you to a veterinary specialist for advanced diagnostics.</p><h2>How to Prevent Weight Loss in Cats</h2><p>You can prevent weight loss in your cat by regularly monitoring body condition and visiting the vet regularly for wellness examinations. Cats are experts at hiding illness and injuries, but your vet may be able to detect a problem before it gets out of hand. Be sure to report any changes in your cat's behavior to your vet right away. It is much easier to treat a health problem in the early stages than to wait until your cat becomes very ill.</p>",1125
131,https://www.thesprucepets.com/vomiting-blood-in-cats-4767432,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Is Vomiting Blood</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Is Vomiting Blood</h1><p>It is not uncommon for cats to throw up the occasional hairball. However, if your cat were to ever vomit blood, also called hematemesis, your cat could be suffering from something that requires immediate veterinary medical attention. Hematemesis can have two very different appearances. If the blood is coming from the esophagus, stomach, or upper part of the small intestines, it may appear as bright red streaks.</p><p>If the blood is coming from further down the GI tract, thought, it will appear as coffee grounds. This is due to the blood being partially digested. Regardless of where in the GI tract the blood originated from, vomiting blood can be indicative of a wide variety of medical conditions that your vet can help you diagnose and treat.</p><h2>Gastrointestinal Ulcers</h2><p>As in people, cats can develop open sores on the mucous membranes lining of their esophagus or stomach. Gastrointestinal ulcers are uncommon in cats. They are often associated with tumors in cats, but the cause can also be unknown. They can also cause a loss of appetite, pale gums, lethargy, dark stools, and bloody diarrhea.</p><p>If you suspect that your cat is vomiting blood due to an ulcer, get them in to see their vet as soon as your can. Your vet will then be able to create a treatment plan specific to your cat.</p><h2>Rat Poison Ingestion</h2><p>Conventional rat poisons are incredibly dangerous around animals and children. Most people don't realize that when a rodent ingests rat poison and subsequently dies, the poison doesn't just stop being toxic. In fact, if a cat (or any other animal, domesticate or wild) ingests a rodent that has passed away from rodenticide ingestion, could be just as at risk as a cat that gets into the rat poison directly.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>A cat that ingests rat poison can not only experience hematemesis but also difficulty breathing, lack of appetite, lethargy, excessive thirst, as well as excessive bleeding. If you suspect that your cat has gotten into rat poison, immediately get your cat to a veterinarian.</p><h3>Testing</h3><p>If you are able to, collect a small sample of the vomit to bring with in case your vet would want to examine it. When you arrive, the vet may want to perform blood and urine tests to confirm rat poison toxicity. Depending on the severity of your cat's toxicity, your vet will begin treatment to neutralize the poison and get your cat healthy again.</p><h2>Clotting Disorder</h2><p>On rare instances, your cat may have a genetic disorder called hemophilia. This is a rare blood disorder that interferes with the body's clotting cascade and, thus, inhibits the formation of clots. Depending on how severe your cat's bleeding it, your vet may want to hospitalize your cat for blood and plasma transfusions.</p><h2>Inflammatory Bowel Disease</h2><p>Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a GI condition seen in cats. While the true cause is not yet known, most professionals believe it is either the result of food allergies or a hypersensitivity to normal gut flora. IBD is chronic condition, meaning veterinary medicine cannot cure it, but we can manage symptoms.</p><p>Cats suffering from this disease can also exhibit diarrhea, weight loss, bloody stools, and decreased appetite. Your vet will want to run blood work to check their organ function as well as their Vitamin B levels before starting a treatment regimen for IBD if that is the cause of your cat's hematemesis.</p><h2>Panleukopenia</h2><p>Feline panleukopenia (FP) is very closely related to canine parvovirus as it is a highly contagious and life-threatening viral disease. It is sometimes referred to as feline distemper and is part of the ""feline distemper"" vaccine, which also vaccinated for feline viral rhinotracheaitis as well as calicivirus. Keeping your cat current on their vaccines will protect them from FP.</p><p>If your cat has experienced a lapse in vaccines and FP is the cause of their hematemesis, your vet will want to hospitalize your cat on IV fluids as, just as with puppies that contract parvovirus, supportive therapy is the best treatment for panleukopenia.</p><h2>Heartworm Disease</h2><p>While heartworm infection is a well known and well-discussed concern among veterinarians and dog owners, cat owners might be surprised to learn that our feline friends can, unfortunately, contract this deadly parasite as well. Heartworm disease, while not as commonly seen in cats as with dogs, is a serious concern.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>While there is a treatment for canine heartworm disease (albeit an expensive, painful treatment), there is no treatment for feline heartworm disease. Cats that contract heartworm can suffer from a condition known as Heartworm Associated Respiratory Disease (HARD). Symptoms of HARD can include vomiting (of both blood and food), coughing, asthma-like attacks, lack of appetite, or weight loss.</p><h3>Testing</h3><p>There is a simple blood test in dogs to check for heartworms, but the most commonly used test checks only for the adult worm. Cats are slightly more resistant to heartworm infection than dogs, though, so most cats with heartworm don't have any adult worms. Instead, if your veterinarian suspects your cat to be suffering from HARD, they will want to run both an antigen test as well as an antibody test. The antigen test will check to make sure there are no adult worms, but the antibody test will be able to detect exposure to heartworm larvae.</p><h3>Prevention</h3><p>There is monthly prevention for heartworm in cats, just as there is in dogs. Since there is no known treatment for cats with HARD, prevention is key. Your veterinarian will be able to discuss the different prevention options available as well as your cat's risk for exposure.</p><h2>Foreign Material</h2><p>A foreign object in the GI tract can cause intestinal inflammation at best and an intestinal perforation at worst. The most commonly seen foreign object in cats is string and thread, so keeping these out of the reach of your cat is of the utmost importance. A cat that has a partial or full intestinal blockage from a foreign object will vomit when their food reaches the blockage and cannot continue through the GI tract any further. If there is a perforation or any associated inflammation there may be blood associated with the vomit. Foreign body obstructions require urgent veterinary attention.</p><h3>Detection and Treatment</h3><p>If your cat's hematemesis is the result of a foreign object in the GI tract, your vet will want to do imaging, such as an x-ray and/or ultrasound and blood work. Depending on their physical exam findings, testing, and the symptoms your cat is exhibiting, they may want to take your cat straight to surgery or hospitalize on IV fluids and observe them to see if the object can pass on it's own with just supportive care.</p><h3>Causes</h3><p>The causes for hematemesis are varied and some are more emergent than others, but all do require immediate attention. Your vet can help you determine what medical issue your cat is struggling with and create a treatment plan to help them feel better in not time</p>",1136
132,https://www.thesprucepets.com/reasons-why-your-cat-is-vomiting-5074987,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Why Is My Cat Throwing Up Water?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is My Cat Throwing Up Water?</h1><p>Cats can vomit for a multitude of reasons and what they vomit can be just as varied. Water or clear liquid, though, can be a sign of a serious illness. Vomiting itself is what is considered to be a nonspecific symptom. It could be associated with an array of health concerns. Some of these can include things like allergic reactions, internal obstructions, pancreatitis, heatstroke/hyperthermia, hypothermia, parasitic infections, liver disease, poisoning, stress, depression, or even anxiety. But what could be causing your cat to vomit water or clear liquid specifically?</p><p>It can be difficult to tell the difference between water and clear liquid. Clear liquid vomit is a sign that the cat is bringing up fluid from the digestive tract. Occasionally, if your cat is vomiting right after drinking a large amount of water, they will also vomit clear liquid, the water they just drank. When a cat drinks too much water too fast, the stomach becomes filled up with water, will be stretched and enlarged causing the cat to throw up water. Conditions that can cause increased thirst and consequently increased water consumption include kidney disease, hyperthyroidism and diabetes mellitus. Other causes of a cat throwing up water is motion sickness, hairballs, gastritis, and more.</p><h2>Possible Causes for Your Cat Vomiting Clear Liquid</h2><h2>Hairballs</h2><p>Cats are naturally meticulously clean animals and groom themselves for a large part of their day. As your cat grooms themselves, tiny hook-like structures on their tongue catch loose and dead hair, which is then swallowed. The majority of the hair passes all the way through the digestive tract with no problems, but sometimes the hair stays in the stomach and forms a hairball.</p><p>Commonly, cats will vomit up clear liquid prior to a hairball. Although, a cat vomiting up clear liquid with a hairball occasionally can be normal and not a concern, it is important to note that hairballs should not be frequent, painful, or difficult for your cat to pass. To help prevent hairballs in your cat, there are over the counter dietary supplements, in either chew or gel forms. Adopting a regular brushing schedule and getting your cat comfortable with brushing can also help get rid of any loose fur in your cat's coat that they may otherwise ingest when grooming themselves.</p><h2>Food and Dietary Changes</h2><p>When there is a change in your cats feeding schedule, if your cat misses a meal or eats later than normal, your cat may vomit up clear liquid.</p><p>In addition, you may have switched your cat 's food too quickly. When changing your cat to a new diet, it is recommended to do it gradually over a five to seven-day period gradually decreasing the amount of current cat food while increasing the amount of new cat food.</p><p>Your cat may eat too quickly, and this can cause clear vomit or clear vomit with food present. If you cat is a habitual 'scarf and barf' cat or if they have intestinal sensitivities, that may be causing them to vomit up partially digested or undigested food. If your vet has ruled out other medical issues and thinks that what your cat is vomiting up is actually food, they may want you to try a commercial, sensitive systems food with your cat. If your cat is still struggling with vomiting food on this special diet, they may then want to put your cat on a strict, hydrolyzed protein diet.</p><p>Your vet may also suggest food puzzles for your cat. Food puzzles are a great source of both play and enrichment for your cat. There are more and more manufactured food puzzles available on the market that stimulate both your cat's predatory and foraging instincts. The added benefit of food puzzles for a cat that chronically vomits their food, though, is that it slows down the chow time so that a cat cannot eat too quickly and then get sick from it.</p><h2>Indigestion</h2><p>Just like in people, a cat's stomach produces various gastric juices as well as hydrochloric acid to digest their food. If, however, a cat skips a meal for some reason, or if they are not fed on time, that buildup of juice and acid can irritate the stomach and cause your cat to vomit. Cats with indigestion may vomit clear liquid, yellow foam, and white foam. If you and your vet suspect your cat's vomiting is from indigestion, your vet may suggest feeding small, frequent meals at the same time throughout the day so as to alleviate any buildup of stomach acid.</p><h2>Gastritis</h2><p>If your cat is one to get into things they shouldn't, it is possible that they have irritated their stomach with something that they have eaten. When this happens, you may see vomiting clear liquid in addition to vomiting blood and/or bile. Your cat may also be exhibiting a decrease in appetite, a depressed attitude, lethargy, or dehydration. Your vet will know just what to do if your cat is vomiting because of gastritis.</p><h2>What Should I Do if My Cat Is Vomiting Water?</h2><p>Some cat owners may describe their cat as 'puke-y' but it should be noted that frequent vomiting is never normal for a cat. Vomiting more than once a week is definitely a sign of problem. If your cat is vomiting clear liquid or water several times and/or in conjunction with other symptoms such as lack of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, or diarrhea, you should make an appointment with your vet right away.

An x-ray study will check for any fluid in the abdomen that could potentially be blood and it may also show intestinal gas patterns that could be indicative of a blockage.</p><p>Depending on what your doctor finds, your cat may require hospitalization for fluid therapy and supportive care, or they may just need outpatient treatments and oral medications to go home on. If your vet suspects your cat has an intestinal blockage your cat may require surgery to remove whatever the blockage is</p>",1053
133,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-going-bald-on-hind-legs-3384806,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Hair Loss on Hind Legs in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Hair Loss on Hind Legs in Cats</h1><p>A cat losing hair on its hind legs is cause for concern. It's normal for a cat to be shedding, but sudden loss or thinning of hair on the back legs is not. Hair loss in cats, also known as alopecia, can be caused by a variety of issues from fleas, allergies, a bacterial infection, or stress, all of which are problems that must be addressed. Know the difference between normal shedding and abnormal hair loss so you can react appropriately.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Lose Hair on Their Hind Legs?</h2><p>Hair loss occurs in response to many factors, including poor nutrition, autoimmune disease, fungal infections, allergies, and parasites. Cat hair loss can be partial or complete, and the patterns can vary or be symmetrical. The skin surrounding the area of hair loss can appear normal, or it can have redness, bumps, and scabs. Hair loss is a symptom, and the underlying cause must be determined in order to be treated. If a cat has hair loss and is scratching the area excessively, the itching problem should be investigated first. Below are four of the most common causes of hair loss on hind legs in cats.</p><h2>Fleas and Other Parasites</h2><p>Fleas are one of the most common reasons to see hind leg hair loss in cats. Fleas are no fun for any cat and can cause your cat a lot of discomfort, many cats develop an allergy to flea bites. Flea bite hypersensitivity (allergy) or flea allergic dermatitis (FAD) is very common in cats. In these cats, just one flea bite can cause severe and prolonged itching which often results in hair loss and can lead to open sores or scabs on the skin, allowing a secondary bacterial infection to occur. Many cats will excessively chew or lick the hair off their legs when they have fleas or FAD. Hair loss around the neck, legs, and base of the tail can also be seen along with small crusty scabs called miliary lesions, a term that was coined because the scabs look like millet seeds.</p><p>Since the flea saliva causes the reaction, the most important treatment for flea allergy is to prevent fleabites. Both indoor and outdoor cats can get fleas and it is recommended to keep your cat on a veterinary approved flea prevention monthly to prevent fleas. </p><p>Other parasites, including mites and ringworm can also cause excessive scratching, licking, or chewing, but fleas are the most common to cause hair loss on hind legs.</p><h2>Pain</h2><p>Cats who are exhibiting pain can over-groom the areas that are painful. Feline lower urinary tract disease and arthritis are two common causes of pain and discomfort for cats. In response to this pain, they may over-groom to the point of hair loss on their lower belly, the inside of their hind legs, and around their genitals.</p><p>Pain can be difficult to assess in cats and it is important to be aware of signs of pain in cats and to contact your veterinarian.</p><p>Always consult your veterinarian for an appropriate pain therapy plan. Their plan can include pain medications, laser therapy, acupuncture, and supplements.</p><h2>Allergies</h2><p>Food, environmental, and flea allergies as mentioned above may also be part of the reason why your cat is experiencing hair loss on their hindlegs. The first step in treatment of allergies is to find the source of the allergen and eliminate it. When it comes to food allergies, most cats are actually allergic to a protein and not other nutrient sources. A hydrolyzed diet is a food that has gone through a process where the protein is broken down into its individual amino acid components. This prevents your cat's immune system from identifying the food as containing an allergen and prevents your cat from having symptoms of an allergy flare up. Other allergens, such as mold in the environment can cause itching, scratching, and overgrooming.</p><h2>Stress and Anxiety</h2><p>Cats are meticulously clean creatures and fastidious groomers. Cats typically spend between 30 percent and 50 percent of their day grooming themselves. However, if your cat is grooming themselves to the point of hair loss or skin wounds, they can be suffering from an underlying medical as noted above or psychological issue.</p><p>Grooming is a normal reaction of cats to make themselves feel better during stressful situations or when they are anxious. This can become compulsive if the grooming behavior is performed out of context and so frequently that it disrupts normal activity. The areas cats commonly over groom due to stress include the abdomen, inside of the thighs, and the lower back. Cats may groom excessively when the caregivers are not present, so it can be difficult to note. Most caregivers will notice areas where the hair is thin or absent. Some cats will lick in one area alone while other cats may groom excessively in more than one area.</p><p>Compulsive grooming, also known as psychogenic alopecia, is usually triggered by a change in the cat 's daily routine or environment, such as moving to a new house or the arrival of a new family member or pet. Other stressors can include tension between cats, too much competition for resources, and boredom.</p><p>It is important to have medical issues ruled out by your veterinarian. Cats with psychogenic alopecia will often have hair loss without inflammation of the skin, although severe overgrooming can result in secondary infections and irritation, and your cats hair under a microscope will appear pulled out entirely or broken off near the skins surface.</p><p>The treatment is to establish an underlying cause with your veterinarian, identify any stressors and eliminate them if possible, provide mental and physical enrichment, maintain consistent routines, and create a less stressful environment. You can create a less stressful environment by adding hiding and vertical places for your cat, playing with your cat more, and using products that mimic a chemical that cats emit through the glands on their faces when they are feeling calm and want to communicate that to other cats in the area.</p><h2>How to Prevent Hair Loss</h2><p>Not all of the causes of hair loss in cats are preventable. However, you can take steps to keep your cat as healthy and happy as possible.</p><p>Cats can lose fur on their hind legs due to a variety of issues. The first step in treatment is finding out the underlying cause of the hair loss. If you notice your cat is losing hair, take your cat to your veterinarian for an exam. The sooner the cause is diagnosed, the sooner the cat can be feeling better and growing back their coats.</p>",1088
134,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-is-not-eating-4579814,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>8 Reasons Why Your Cat Is Not Eating</h1>,"<h1>8 Reasons Why Your Cat Is Not Eating</h1><p>A cat that suddenly decides to stop eating is often a sign of a more serious problem. It's not usually because a cat just doesn't want a certain treat anymore. If your cat isn't eating and has skipped several meals, or gone a few days without food, you should take action. There may be things you can do at home to help your cat regain its appetite, but sometimes veterinary intervention is necessary.</p><h2>Why It's a Problem If Your Cat Stops Eating</h2><p>Your cat might not like the food you're offering, but lack of appetite is often a symptom of an underlying issue. Your cat may stop eating if there's something stuck in its stomach or intestines or if it isn't feeling well because of an underlying disease or infection. Or, your cat might not like the food you're offering. Your cat's lack of eating can also be a symptom of pain or discomfort. Regardless of the reason, it's a major concern if your cat stops eating.</p><p>If you have an obese cat that's stopped eating, it can quickly develop hepatic lipidosis by going without food for a few days. This disease is often referred to as fatty liver disease or fatty liver syndrome and it can be fatal if left untreated. This is the main reason why it's so important to make sure your cat, especially if it's overweight, keeps eating. With fatty liver disease, the liver is overwhelmed trying to convert fat into energy. An excess of fat accumulates in the liver, leading to impaired liver function. The liver is a critical organ and if it's not working effectively, your cat can develop weakness, lethargy, and jaundice without immediate treatment from your veterinarian.</p><h2>Health Issues That Cause a Cat to Stop Eating</h2><h3>Respiratory Diseases</h3><p>Respiratory problems can affect your cat's sense of smell or ability to breathe leading to a loss of appetite. Upper respiratory diseases may clog your cat's nose and eyes with discharge resulting in a temporary loss or restriction of sight and smell. Lower respiratory tract diseases may affect your cat's lungs causing it to have difficulty breathing. These respiratory issues may be caused by bacterial or viral infection that require basic care or they might be as complicated as cancer. Regardless of the severity of the respiratory issue, if the disease keeps your cat from being able to breathe easily or smell its food, it may decide it doesn't want to eat.</p><h3>Digestive System Diseases</h3><p>Problems with your cat's stomach, intestines, pancreas, or other parts of its digestive system may cause it to stop eating. Your cat may also vomit and have diarrhea or abdominal pain alongside digestive issues. But usually, a decrease in appetite will be one of the first signs of a digestive system problem. Issues can range from acid reflux, tumors, an imbalance of intestinal bacteria, parasites, irritable bowel disease, and other problems.</p><h3>Foreign Bodies</h3><p>Some cats like to eat things that they shouldn't or may swallow hairballs, all of which may become stuck in the stomach or intestines. A foreign body stuck in your cat's gastrointestinal tract is referred to as a gastrointestinal obstruction, or GI obstruction. A GI obstruction won't let food pass through the digestive tract and therefore your cat may vomit and most likely stop eating. Some foreign bodies can pass through your cat's system and may cause temporary GI upset or lack of appetite, but others may require surgery to be removed.</p><h3>Dental Disease</h3><p>Diseased or painful teeth and gums can cause your cat to stop eating. Cats can fracture their teeth, develop resorptive lesions on their teeth, develop inflammation of their gums, form dental abscesses, and experience other dental issues that cause mouth pain. Just like people, your cat may not want to eat if its mouth hurts. However, dental issues may be difficult to diagnose in a cat, and your veterinarian may need to sedate or anesthetize your pet in order to evaluate the problem.</p><h2>Food Issues That Cause a Cat to Stop Eating</h2><h3>Food Flavor</h3><p>Cats can be particular. A cat may eat one flavor of the same brand, but completely reject a new flavor due to preference. A sudden rejection of food may occur if food manufacturers change flavors and ingredients without any obvious signs on the packaging-your cat may take notice and rebel.</p><h3>Food Shape or Texture</h3><p>Your cat can also be sensitive to certain shapes and textures when it comes to food. Some cats like triangle shapes, others like round shapes, and others will only eat crunchy dry food or canned wet food.</p><h3>Food Spoilage</h3><p>If you give your cat expired or spoiled food, it may not want to eat it. Check the expiration date on the food. Or, at the very least, give it a sniff to see if it smells rancid.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Did you know dry cat food can become stale or rancid? Vitamins and fats can erode if the food isn't properly stored. Keep food in its original bag for a good reason. The bag may have a special barrier to keep food fresher longer. To ensure the food's best freshness, put the original bag in a sealed container and place it in a cool, moisture-free environment.</p><h2>How to Get Your Cat to Eat</h2><p>If your cat has stopped eating its normal food, check to see if there's a recall on that particular food. It's another good reason why you should consider keeping your cat's dry food in its original bag so you can check the bar code. Sometimes a cat can sense that something is wrong with their food and won't eat it.</p><p>Depending on the reason why your cat has stopped eating, you may be able to coax your kitty to start eating again. However, it 's not normal for a cat to stop eating if their food has not changed, so a trip to your veterinarian is recommended to rule out medical reasons.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>Give your cat vitamin B12. This vitamin is often depleted in a cat with a digestive issue. There are over-the-counter, cat-specific oral forms as well as injections that your veterinarian may administer. It's a harmless, water-soluble vitamin that can potentially increase your cat's appetite.</p>",1015

Most of the time, your cat vomits out a hairball or throws up because it ate too fast. But if your cat is throwing up white foam, it usually means vomiting on an empty stomach. One single episode of vomiting usually isn't serious, but if your cat is vomiting frequently, that's a sign that something is wrong.</p><p>Common reasons for cats to vomit foam include inflammation or irritation in the digestive system, ingestion of a foreign body such as string, internal parasites, bacterial or viral infections, systemic disease such as kidney or thyroid issues, or a food intolerance or allergy.</p><p>Cats often appear perfectly fine after an episode of vomiting, but should your cat show signs of illness, such as lethargy, refusal to eat, diarrhea, or acting ""off,"" or if your cat vomits frequently, it's time to give your veterinarian a call. The vet can help you figure out what is ailing your cat and how to help bring your pet relief.</p><h2>Indigestion</h2><p>Just like in people, a cat's stomach produces various gastric juices as well as hydrochloric acid to digest their food. If, however, a cat skips a meal for some reason, or if they aren't fed on time, that build-up of juice and acid can irritate the stomach and cause your cat to vomit. Cats with indigestion may vomit yellow foam in addition to white foam. If you and your vet suspect your cat's vomiting is from indigestion, your vet may suggest feeding small, frequent meals at the same time throughout the day so as to alleviate any build-up of stomach acid.</p><h2>Hairballs</h2><p>All cats lick to groom themselves and they inevitably will ingest fur while doing so. Sometimes they can pass the fur in their stool, but sometimes the fur builds up and cannot be passed. When this happens, the fur needs to go somewhere, and your cat will vomit it up. If your cat is vomiting white foam but not yet any fur, it might be a precursor to a hairball. To prevent hairballs there are over-the-counter dietary supplements, in either chew or gel forms. Adopting a regular brushing schedule can also help get rid of any loose fur in your cat's coat that they may otherwise ingest when grooming themselves.</p><h2>Gastritis</h2><p>If your cat is one to get into things they shouldn't, it is possible that they have irritated their stomach with something that they have eaten. When this happens, you may see vomiting white foam in addition to vomiting blood and/or bile. Your cat may also be exhibiting a decrease in appetite, a depressed attitude, lethargy, or dehydration. Your vet will know just what to do if your cat is vomiting because of gastritis.</p><h2>Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)</h2><p>Irritable bowel syndrome, sometimes called inflammatory bowel disease, is one of the most common causes of vomiting in cats. Cats that suffer from IBS can also experience diarrhea and/or chronic decompensation. If your vet suspects IBS they will want to run lab work to confirm the diagnosis and then set up a treatment plan to help alleviate your cat's symptoms.</p><h2>Pancreatitis</h2><p>Cats can suffer from pancreatitis just like dogs and just like people. It can be either acute or chronic. It can also be concurrent with other diseases, such as gastrointestinal disease, liver disease, and/or diabetes. In addition to vomiting, signs of cats suffering from pancreatitis may include lethargy, loss of appetite, dehydration, weight loss, low body temperature, jaundice, fever, and abdominal pain. If pancreatitis is the reason for your cat's vomiting your vet will likely want to start treating it with fluid therapy and medications.</p><h2>Hepatic Insufficiency</h2><p>Cats suffering from liver disease can show a variety of nonspecific symptoms, such as vomiting, lack of appetite, or weight loss, as well as more severe symptoms like jaundice, or yellowing of the skin and sclera (whites of the eyes). Liver disease is not curable but the symptoms can be managed. Your vet will create a treatment plan for your cat so that they can start feeling better.</p><h2>Diabetes</h2><p>The major symptoms of diabetes in cats, just as in dogs and people, are increased drinking and urination, as well as weight loss and dehydration. If your cat is suddenly showing an increase in drinking and urinating, either in combination with any of the other listed symptoms or without, don't delay making an appointment to get your cat seen by your vet. Depending on the severity of your cat's diabetes, your vet may want to start insulin therapy or a simple diet change.</p><h2>Renal Insufficiency</h2><p>Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a very common disease of senior cats. Other symptoms of CKD include a considerable increase in drinking, a change in urine output, a loss of appetite, dehydration, a dull mood, a poor fur coat, and weakness. Similar to liver disease, kidney disease cannot be cured but the symptoms can be managed. If your senior cat starts showing any urinary signs have your cat seen by your vet. If they diagnose your cat with CKD they can talk to you about supportive care, both at home and in hospital, to help your cat cope with his/her renal insufficiency.</p><h2>Hyperthyroidism</h2><p>An overactive thyroid is another very common disease of senior cats. Symptoms, in addition to vomiting, can include weight loss despite an increase in eating and drinking, diarrhea, increased urination, and excessive vocalizations. If your senior cat is showing any of these symptoms your vet will want to run bloodwork to check their thyroid hormone levels. If your cat is indeed hyperthyroid, your vet will talk to you about daily medication to help treat the symptoms of this disease.</p><h2>Parasites</h2><p>Sometimes vomiting, when in conjunction with diarrhea in a young kitten that hasn't been routinely dewormed, can be a sign of unchecked parasitic infection. Checking a stool sample and prescribing the appropriate dewormer can quickly correct this.</p><p>If you're struggling with a pukey cat at home, don't resign yourself to the common myth that it's normal for a cat to vomit on a semi-regular basis. Schedule an appointment with your veterinarian to help get to the bottom of why your cat is vomiting and your cat (and your floors) will thank you.</p>",1035
136,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-vomiting-clear-liquid-4777783,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>What It Means When Your Cat Is Vomiting Clear Liquid</h1>,"<h1>What It Means When Your Cat Is Vomiting Clear Liquid</h1><p>When your cat vomits clear liquid, it can be a sign of a serious illness. The clear liquid your cat is vomiting up comes from the digestive tract. Vomiting is associated with an array of health concerns including things like hairballs, internal obstructions, pancreatitis, eating too quickly, constipation, indigestion, parasitic infections, poisoning, stress, depression, or even anxiety. Consider other symptoms your cat is exhibiting to determine the cause of the vomiting. A cat that is repeatedly vomiting clear liquid and showing other symptoms of distress or illness should be seen by a vet.</p><h2>Possible Causes for Your Cat Vomiting Clear Liquid</h2><h3>Hairballs</h3><p>Cats are naturally meticulously clean animals and groom themselves for a large part of their day. As your cat grooms themselves, tiny hook-like structures on their tongue catch loose and dead hair, which is then swallowed. The majority of the hair passes all the way through the digestive tract with no problems, but sometimes the hair stays in the stomach and forms a hairball.</p><p>Commonly, cats will vomit up clear liquid prior to a hairball. Although, a cat vomiting up clear liquid with a hairball occasionally can be normal and not a concern, it is important to note that hairballs should not be frequent, painful, or difficult for your cat to pass. Some commercial cat diets and treats are formulated to help prevent the formation of hairballs. Adopting a regular brushing schedule and getting your cat comfortable with brushing can also help get rid of any loose fur in your cat's coat that they may otherwise ingest when grooming themselves.</p><h3>Food and Dietary Changes</h3><p>When there is a change in your cat's feeding schedule, if your cat misses a meal or eats later than normal, your cat may vomit up clear liquid.</p><p>In addition, you may have switched your cat 's food too quickly. When changing your cat to a new diet, do it gradually over a one to two-week period, decreasing the amount of current cat food while increasing the amount of new cat food.</p><p>Your cat may eat too quickly, and this can cause clear vomit or clear vomit with food present. If your cat is a habitual 'scarf and barf' cat or if they have intestinal sensitivities, that may be causing them to vomit up partially digested or undigested food. If your vet has ruled out other medical issues and thinks that what your cat is vomiting up is actually food, they may want you to try a commercial, sensitive systems food with your cat. If your cat is still struggling with vomiting food on this special diet, they may then want to put your cat on a strict, hydrolyzed protein diet.</p><p>Your vet may also suggest food puzzles for your cat. Food puzzles are a great source of both play and enrichment for your cat. There are more and more manufactured food puzzles available on the market that stimulate both your cat's predatory and foraging instincts. The added benefit of food puzzles for a cat that chronically vomits its food, though, is that it slows down the chow time so that a cat cannot eat too quickly and then get sick.</p><h3>Indigestion</h3><p>Just like in people, a cat's stomach produces various gastric juices as well as hydrochloric acid to digest their food. If, however, a cat skips a meal for some reason, or if they are not fed on time, that buildup of juice and acid can irritate the stomach and cause your cat to vomit. Cats with indigestion may vomit yellow foam in addition to white foam. If you and your vet suspect your cat's vomiting is from indigestion, and has ruled out other more serious causes, your vet may suggest feeding small, frequent meals at the same time throughout the day so as to alleviate any buildup of stomach acid.</p><h3>Gastritis</h3><p>If your cat is one to get into things they shouldn't, it is possible that they have irritated their stomach with something that they have eaten. When this happens, you may see vomiting clear liquid in addition to vomiting blood and/or bile. Your cat may also be exhibiting a decrease in appetite, a depressed attitude, lethargy, or dehydration. Your vet will know just what to do if your cat is vomiting because of gastritis.</p><h2>What Should I Do If My Cat Is Vomiting Clear Liquid?</h2><p>Some cat owners may describe their cat as ""puke-y,"" but it should be noted that frequent vomiting is never normal for a cat. Vomiting more than once a week is definitely a sign of a problem. If your cat is vomiting clear liquid several times and/or in conjunction with other symptoms such as lack of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, or diarrhea, you should make an appointment with your vet right away. Your vet will start with a physical exam, checking your cat's vital signs, and palpating your cat's abdomen. After a thorough examination, your vet may also run some tests, including blood work and x-rays. Blood work will check your cat's organ function, making sure that there are no signs of liver disease or kidney disease, as well as your cat's red blood cell and platelet levels. An x-ray study will check for any fluid in the abdomen that could potentially be blood and it may also show intestinal gas patterns that could be indicative of a blockage.</p><p>Depending on what your doctor finds, your cat may require hospitalization for fluid therapy and supportive care, or they may just need outpatient treatments and oral medications to take home. If your vet suspects an intestinal blockage your cat may require surgery to remove the blockage.</p>",931
137,https://www.thesprucepets.com/hair-loss-in-cats-554758,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Hair Loss in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Hair Loss in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Hair loss, also known as feline alopecia, is a common problem for many cats that can have a variety of causes. While it may be alarming for owners to notice missing patches of their pet's furry coat, many reasons behind this condition can be treated by your veterinarian. Some cats (like the easily recognizable Sphynx) are bred to be hairless, but hair loss on otherwise fully-coated cats indicates another problem. Medical conditions, parasites, behavioral issues, and even pain can lead to your pet losing its fur. When left untreated, alopecia can continue spreading to additional parts of the cat's body. In addition to taking their cats in for a veterinary exam, owners can take a few preventative steps to reduce any discomfort their cats may experience.</p><h2>What Is Hair Loss?</h2><p>Hair loss in cats (feline alopecia) is a condition that causes cats to lose patches of their coat, resulting in bald sections on parts of the body that are normally covered in fur. A variety of factors can contribute to feline alopecia, so the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder can involve multiple steps. Alopecia may include full or partial loss that appears in asymmetrical or symmetrical patterns in the fur. Additionally, it can include different parts of the body like the neck, the base of the tail, hind leg hair loss, and more.</p><h2>Symptoms of Hair Loss in Cats</h2><p>Since feline alopecia is a symptom of other health issues, cats experiencing hair loss should see a veterinarian who can perform tests to determine the cause. Your cat may have physical medical conditions that lead to it losing patches of its fur, or it may simply be rooted in behavioral problems like stress that can be managed with lifestyle changes.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>If the bald patches on your cat's skin are accompanied by behaviors like itching, it might be indicative of allergies or other skin diseases. These are typically caused by food, airborne particles, or bites from fleas and mosquitos. You may also notice your cat licking or scratching the problem area until it becomes red and irritated. This can lead to sores on the skin.</p><p>While the above symptoms are commonly seen with hair loss, other symptoms may be signs of more serious diseases. Some cats may also vomit, become lethargic, or have changes in their appetite. Veterinary care should be sought as soon as possible, both in cases of unusual hair loss and when additional symptoms are present.</p><h2>Causes of Hair Loss</h2><p>There are several reasons that cats experience hair loss. Like other itchy skin problems, your cat may lose patches of its fur from excessive scratching during bouts of fleas, ticks, or mites. Underlying medical conditions can also be the cause, which will require specific treatments from a veterinarian based on the diagnosis. Hair loss can also happen when cats experience physical pain or behavioral issues that lead to overgrooming.</p><h2>Diagnosing Hair Loss in Cats</h2><p>To diagnose the cause behind feline hair loss, veterinarians can take samples from the skin's surface to look for infections like mites, yeast, and bacteria under a microscope. They may also do a skin biopsy or culture, along with performing a visual exam to see if fleas or other infestations are present.</p><p>If the results of these exams are normal, bloodwork will likely be ordered to determine whether a hormonal or thyroid imbalance is causing the hair loss. If the cause is still unsure, imaging tools like X-rays and ultrasounds can help your veterinarian rule out cancer or abnormalities in the adrenal glands.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If the alopecia is due to a medical disorder, like skin erosions, thyroid imbalance, or other hormonal imbalances, your veterinarian may prescribe medications and topical ointments to treat the underlying cause. When cats lose hair due to fleas or ticks, owners need to clean their homes, including the cat's bedding, toys, and other kitty gear. Your veterinarian can help you determine a long-term solution to flea control and prevention to help your cat stay pest-free in the future.</p><p>If the hair loss is due to a behavioral issue, owners need to use behavior modification to lessen the problem. A feline behaviorist could be helpful in ""reteaching"" your cat the appropriate grooming behaviors. Anxiety medications, synthetic feline facial pheromone spray, or other calming aids may prove helpful as well.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Hair Loss</h2><p>Depending on the cause, your cat's hair loss can often be a temporary problem when proper treatment is administered. Many conditions, including skin diseases like ringworm, can be healed and result in the regrowth of your cat's fur. In other cases, your cat's fur may never grow fully again.</p><p>In addition to administering the appropriate medication, observe your cat's condition to ensure the hair loss doesn't get worse. If no cure is available, properly caring for your cat with alopecia will focus on preventing itchiness, pain, and secondary infections.</p><h2>How to Prevent Hair Loss</h2><p>Preventing feline hair loss can require a variety of care steps from the owner. If your cat has already experienced alopecia, talk to your veterinarian about the best methods to keep its fur healthy after treatment. Additionally, keeping pests at bay can help prevent itchiness that leads to overgrooming.</p><h3>Medical Care</h3><p>Ask your veterinarian about safe topical treatments to provide relief from pain and itching. If you can break the cycle of scratching and biting the inflamed skin, your cat has a better chance of healing. Using regular tick and flea control medication is another important step to keep your cat healthy and rule those pests out as a possible reason for hair loss.</p><h3>Household Exams and Prevention</h3><p>If your cat continues biting and pulling at its hair, do a thorough examination of its skin and hair at least once a week. Use a fine-toothed comb and part the hair to examine individual sections. Pay extra attention to areas that your cat scratches more than others. It's also helpful to ensure that bedding, toys, or scratching posts are not contributing to the issue by being too rough on the cat's fur.</p>",992
138,https://www.thesprucepets.com/why-is-my-cats-head-shaking-4707868,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Why Is My Cat Shaking Its Head?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is My Cat Shaking Its Head?</h1><p>A cat that has suddenly taken to shaking its head incessantly may have a medical condition that could range from minor to serious. Whether the issue is an underlying ear infection or a more serious problem, you will want to get to the bottom of it quickly and consult your veterinarian so that you can begin treatment and your cat can start to feel some relief.</p><h2>Ear Infections and Ear Mites</h2><p>Cats do get ear infections, just as dogs do. In fact, of all the reasons for head shaking in a cat, an ear infection is the most common cause. When you bring your cat to the vet for head shaking, your vet will first visualize your cat's ear canals with the aid of an otoscope. This allows them to evaluate any potential inflammation within the canal as well as to determine whether the tympanic membrane, also known as the ear drum, is intact or not. This step is important as some ear medications can be toxic to the inner ear.</p><p>Once your vet has been able to check the status of your cat's ear drums, they will take samples of the discharge from your cat's ears. From there, they will microscopically evaluate these swabs. On the scope, your vet may see either cocci (circle-shaped) or rod-shaped bacteria, budding yeast, or ear mites.</p><h3>What Are Ear Mites?</h3><p>Ear mites () are a type of ectoparasite that, while not common in indoor cats, is more frequently seen in cats than in dogs. They can cause an intense itching sensation that can cause your cat to shake its head for relief.</p><p>Depending on what is seen on the microscope (and whether or not your cat's ear drums are intact), your vet will determine what medicine to give to treat the underlying infection or ear mite infestation.</p><h2>Allergies</h2><p>Just like us, cats can be the unfortunate sufferers of allergies. In cats, allergies can arise either from contact, inhalation, food, or insects (especially flea bites) and most often manifest as intense itching around the head, neck, ears, and can include head shaking.</p><p>Your vet may prescribe medications to give some itch relief but will also want to try to figure out the underlying allergen causing the problem. If fleas or flea dirt are seen, a different monthly topical flea preventative may be recommended. If a food allergy is suspected, switching your cat's diet to a limited-ingredient or hydrolyzed food to perform a strict food trial can determine if that is the problem.</p><p>Food trials are incredibly strict-nothing can pass your cat's lips except the prescribed food for six to eight weeks. This includes treats, people food, and flavored supplements. If you're able to stick with it, successfully completing a food trial will definitively diagnose whether or not your cat suffers from a food allergy.</p><h2>Polyps</h2><p>Cats can sometimes develop ear polyps, also called feline inflammatory polyps. These are benign growths that originate from the surface of a cat's middle ear, outer ear, or nasal cavity.</p><p>Polyps can only be effectively treated by surgical removal.</p><h2>Insect Bites</h2><p>Cats, being natural predators, are prone to getting insect bites, mostly on the face and paws. Some cats will have a reaction localized to the site of the bite that can include swelling, inflammation, itching, hives, and also head shaking. If your vet suspects that your cat was the recipient of an insect bite, they might give antihistamines or steroids to treat the inflammation. On rarer instances, your cat may experience an anaphylactic reaction and this requires immediate veterinary attention.</p><h2>Aural Hematoma</h2><p>An aural (ear) hematoma, sometimes referred to as ""pillow ear,"" isn't so much a reason for head shaking as much as it is something that can happen as a consequence of excessive head shaking. There are a number of small blood vessels within the ear pinna (flap) and if a cat (or dog) shakes its head hard enough, for any reason, they run the risk of bursting one of more of these blood vessels. When this happens, the pinna fills with blood and takes on a puffy, pillow-like appearance.</p><p>If your cat suddenly develops an aural hematoma, your vet will be able to discuss treatment options with you and determine which would be best. If your vet thinks your cat would be a good candidate for it-it isn't causing too much discomfort-they may elect to drain the fluid off. The fluid is likely to build back up again because there is now an empty space, so additional steps your vet may take to try to prevent reaccumulation of fluid include giving steroids to reduce inflammation, bandaging the ear (poorly tolerated by most cats), or using cold laser therapy. Your cat's ear may crinkle down as it heals if your vet elects for this treatment option. This is merely a cosmetic concern and won't be of any medical concern for your cat. (Plus, some may argue, a crinkled ear adds some character.)</p><p>If your cat has a more extensive hematoma, your vet may elect for surgical intervention to prevent scarring that could narrow the ear canal. If this is the case, your vet will make an incision to drain out the fluid, then will use a pattern of suturing to tack the pinna together such that it cannot fill back up before it has a chance to scar in and heal. Crinkling of the ear is a less common treatment complication if your vet elects for a surgical repair, but the pinna may not sit in the normal position after a hematoma resolves no matter the treatment.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Don't try to treat excessive head shaking in cats yourself. Over-the-counter ear drops-even when used to treat what you suspect is an ear infection-might not be effective for the type of infection your cat has and could cause side effects such as deafness if the ear drum is damaged, so don't delay in scheduling an appointment with your regular veterinarian to get your cat's head shaking checked out.</p>",984

Blood in your cat's urine is always a concern and can be due to a variety of issues from stress to lower urinary tract disease.</p><h2>What Is Hematuria (Blood in the Urine)?</h2><p>Hematuria is the medical term used to describe blood in the urine. When this happens, you may notice orange or red-tinged urine or blood clots. In some cases, urine may appear normal and the bleeding can be on a microscopic level. In these cases, blood will be detected by diagnostics and laboratory analysis.</p><h3>Signs of Hematuria in Cats</h3> <h2>Causes of Blood in Cat Urine</h2><p>Blood in the urine is a symptom of an underlying issue and not a diagnosis. This symptom can be seen with a variety of health conditions and if noticed, your cat should see a veterinarian.</p><h3>Pandora Syndrome</h3><p>Bacterial UTIs occur much less frequently in cats than in dogs, with only one to two percent of cats suffering from UTIs in their lifetime. More commonly what cats have is Pandora Syndrome which does not in most cases have a bacterial component and treatment consists of more than just an antibiotic.</p><p>A disease of the lower urinary tract is one of the most common problems in cats. It involves inflammation and discomfort in the bladder and the urethra which is the tube leading from the bladder to the outside of the body. This goes by various names, FLUTD (Feline Lower Urinary Tract Disease) or FIC (Feline Idiopathic Cystitis, Idiopathic means the cause is unknown) as well as Pandora Syndrome.</p><p>Pandora syndrome, like the name implies, has no single cause. The underlying causes are likely due to multiple factors: among these include bladder and hormone abnormalities, obesity, environmental stressors, history of early adverse experience or severely stressful events, living with other cats, infections, urinary stones, and/or rock-hard collections of minerals formed in the urinary tract of cats which obstructs the normal flow.</p><p>Cats with Pandora syndrome most often show signs of bladder inflammation, difficulty and pain when urinating, increased frequency of urination, urinating outside of the box, and blood in the urine. Often cats who have Pandora Syndrome will have chronic urinary issues that wax and wane.</p><h3>Urethral Obstruction</h3><p>Urethral obstruction is a medical emergency that can cause a can to urinate blood. This condition is most common in male cats but can be seen in female cats as well. This is because the urethra of a male cat is much longer and much narrower than that of a female cat, and so is more susceptible to becoming blocked.</p><p>A urethral obstruction occurs when the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) is blocked and the cat is unable to pee. The obstruction can be due to several causes including mucous plugs, urinary stones, urinary crystals, strictures, or tumors. An obstruction can occur develop from urethral spasms or swelling secondary to inflammation in the lower urinary tract. When this happens, it is difficult or impossible for a cat to empty the bladder, making it a life-threatening emergency. If your cat is having trouble urinating, it should be seen by a veterinarian immediately. Left untreated, the urethral obstruction can lead to kidney failure and death within 24 to 48 hours.</p><h2>Other Causes</h2><p>Although they are less common causes, hematuria can also be caused by constipation, tumors of the urinary tract, congenital abnormalities (birth defects), or injury to the urinary tract or spinal cord.</p><h2>Diagnosis</h2><p>If you notice blood in your cat 's urine, it's best to contact your veterinarian immediately. At your veterinary visit, your vet will perform an exam and diagnostics to rule out the known causes of blood in urine and form a diagnosis.</p> <h2>Treatment</h2><p>Treatment for hematuria is based on the underlying cause and is tailored to the individual cat. Treatment may include pain medications, diet changes, increasing water intake, fluid therapy, anti-spasmodic medication to help the bladder relax, and stress reduction.</p><p>If your cat has a urethral obstruction, your vet will need to relieve the obstruction quickly. Your vet will need to sedate or anesthetize your cat to place a urinary catheter along with providing supportive care to address pain, nausea, and metabolic changes.</p><p>Infections are treated with antibiotics and pain medication. A prescription diet may be used to try to dissolve bladder stone over a few weeks. If the prescription diet doesn't work the stones need to be surgically removed. Diet and increased water intake can be used to address urinary crystals.</p><h2>How to Prevent Hematuria</h2><p>You cant always prevent blood in your cat's urine but there are factors that are known to increase the chances of your cat having blood in their urine which includes obesity, decreased water intake, and one of the most common causes, stress. Read below to find out you can help prevent hematuria.</p><p>Overall, blood in your cat 's urine can be caused by a variety of issues stemming from the bladder and urethra in cats. If you ever feel as though your cat is experiencing a urinary tract problem, especially if they are straining to urinate and seem uncomfortable, please seek veterinary attention.</p>",866
140,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-has-runny-nose-4846475,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Runny Nose in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Runny Nose in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Runny noses can be annoying for cats, but this common occurrence may have many causes. A cat can have a runny nose because of an allergy, upper respiratory infection, or more complex disease. Sometimes a runny nose will clear up on its own, and other times, especially if there are other symptoms present, a trip to the vet will be necessary. Treatment for your cat's running nose depends on the cause.</p><h2>What is a Runny Nose?</h2><p>Nasal discharge, or a runny nose, is not an illness itself but a sign of an illness or other health issue. A runny nose is caused by something that irritates or inflames the nasal tissues. Nasal discharge may come from one or both nostrils. It may also switch between nostrils.</p><h2>Symptoms of Runny Noses in Cats</h2><p>If your cat has a runny nose, you may or may not notice other signs at the same time. If the nose is running and nothing else seems unusual, it doesn't mean there's not a bigger problem. However, if you see other signs of illness along with nasal discharge, it may be a more urgent issue. Watch for signs of health problems and contact your vet for advice.</p><h3></h3><h3>Nasal Discharge</h3><p>Nasal discharge is often a symptom of an upper respiratory infection. If the discharge has a reddish-brown or greenish tinge may be a sign that the cat has inhaled a foreign substance and it is inflaming its lungs, which is known as aspiration pneumonia. A bloody discharge from the nose may mean many things, such as a trauma to the area, a blood disorder, or something may be lodged in the nasal cavity.</p><h3>Staining or Discoloration of Facial Fur</h3><p>A cat with a runny nose will often be able to wipe away the discharge with its paw, but the moisture will leave a matted, stained, or discolored area around the mouth and nose areas.</p><h3>Nasal Congestion</h3><p>A runny nose, in conjunction with nasal congestion, may indicate that the cat has pneumonia, as well. Fungal pneumonia, for example, is a condition where the cat has inhaled fungus spores, and it can inflame the lining of the nose and sinuses.</p><h3>Sneezing</h3><p>Sneezing, along with thicker nasal discharge, may also be an indication of fungal pneumonia or another type of upper respiratory infection. Sneezing and runny noses may also simply mean the cat is responding with an allergic reaction or developing feline asthma to scents, odors, and particles in the home that come from perfumes, detergents, cleaning products, litter, or even smoke.</p><h3>Coughing</h3><p>A symptom of fungal pneumonia will be a short cough, along with sneezing and nasal congestion.</p><h3>Nasal Swelling</h3><p>If the top of the nose is swollen, and there is sneezing and thick nasal discharge, fungus pneumonia could be the culprit.</p><h3>Eye Discharge</h3><p>A cat with nose and eye discharge may have specific types of pneumonia. It may also have an eye infection which is irritating the nose, as well.</p><h3>Pawing at Face</h3><p>A cat will paw at its face to wipe away the discharge or to ""scratch"" its nose due to the inflammation it feels. It will also paw at its face if it has an eye infection, which is exacerbated by a runny nose.</p><h3>Difficulty Breathing</h3><p>Pneumonia can cause difficulty breathing for the cat due to inflammation of the nasal and sinus linings. A cat's airway can also become compressed as lymph nodes become inflamed due to pneumonia.</p><h3>Loss of Appetite/Weight Loss/Lethargy</h3><p>A cat relies on its nose to find and eat its food. If a cat's nose is stuffed up, it may choose not to eat. As a result, the cat will begin to lose weight and become lethargic from not eating.</p><h2>Causes of Runny Noses</h2><p>There are many possible reasons for a cat to have a runny nose. Most commonly, nasal discharge in cats occurs as a sign of an upper respiratory problem.</p><h2>Diagnosing Runny Noses in Cats</h2><p>If you notice nasal discharge in your cat and there are no other signs of illness, then it's sensible to wait for a day or two to see if the runny nose clears up. If other signs appear, or the runny nose continues for a few days, then your cat will need veterinary attention.</p><p>Call your veterinarian to ask about the next steps. If your cat has cold-like signs (nasal discharge and congestion, sneezing, eye discharge) then your vet's office may want to schedule an appointment at a specific time in order to keep other cats away. Many feline upper respiratory infections are highly contagious.</p><p>If your cat's signs come on suddenly and appear severe, or if there is bleeding from the nose, it's best to contact your vet's office immediately. If acute signs begin when your vet is closed, then contact an emergency vet for advice. This is especially important if your cat has suffered a trauma.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The first thing your veterinarian will do is perform a thorough examination of your cat. Be sure to share as much information as possible about the signs you have seen at home as well as your cat's current and past medical history. Let your vet know about your cat's environment, diet, and any medications or supplements you are giving your pet.</p><p>Your vet may recommend specialized diagnostic and lab testing depending on the outcome of the exam.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Runny Noses</h2><p>For chronic or recurrent problems with nasal discharge, your vet may recommend a consultation with a veterinary specialist. Some types of pneumonia, especially aspiration pneumonia where the cat has inhaled a highly toxic substance, may not respond to treatment.</p><h2>How to Prevent Runny Noses</h2><p>The best way to prevent a runny nose in your cat is to try to stop illnesses and injuries from occurring in the first place. Outdoor cats are at a higher risk for injuries and catching contagious infections. Keeping your cat indoors can greatly reduce the risks. Also, be sure your cat is vaccinated on schedule as recommended by your veterinarian.</p>",969
141,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-of-pain-in-cats-4584357,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>7 Signs That Your Cat Is in Pain</h1>,"<h1>7 Signs That Your Cat Is in Pain</h1><p>It can be difficult to tell if your cat is in pain for many reasons. Cat owners may often miss the subtle signs of pain in their cats or do not notice until their cats are showing more obvious signs, such as loss of appetite and lethargy. In some cases, cats only show more obvious symptoms after being ill for an extended period of time or if they are very ill. By the time you actually notice something is wrong with your cat, it might have been going on for longer than you think.</p><p>Although no one likes to think about their pets living with pain, it is important to be able to notice telltale signs of pain in cats, so that you can take the necessary steps to provide comfort and prevent medical issues from worsening.</p><h2>It Can Be Difficult to Tell If a Cat Is in Pain</h2><p>Cats are experts at hiding illness. This is in part because cats are both prey and predator animals, and in the wild, not showing pain can protect them from predators or other cats that might be a threat. Showing signs of pain makes them more vulnerable to attacks.</p><p>It can also be difficult for your veterinarian to notice signs of pain because of cats hiding their pain due to fear and stress, which is common during veterinary visits. Your cat may also go into fight or flight mode, which can cause a decrease in pain perception.</p><h2>Signs of Pain</h2><p>When cats are dealing with pain, similar to humans, it can affect their behavior. In fact, cats often show behavioral changes prior to physical symptoms.</p><p>It is important for you to know your cat 's normal temperament and behavior. This includes your cat 's normal attitude, energy level, gait, appetite, sleep patterns, thirst, and other physical and behavior patterns. Just the slightest change could be a sign that your cat is sick or in pain. Since your cat cannot tell you it's in pain, your veterinarian relies on you to determine if there are any abnormal behavior patterns that may be pain-related. If your cat is just not acting like itself, this can be a sign that they are experiencing pain.</p><p>Changes in your cats ' daily habits should not always be contributed to aging. Age is not a disease, but as your cat ages, they are more likely to be suffering from pain.</p><h3>Grooming Changes</h3><p>You may notice that your cat is not grooming itself or if it does groom itself, it only focuses on its face and the front of its body. Cats are meticulous cleaners, so be aware of your cat's grooming habits have changed or you notice that its coat is unkempt.</p><h3>Behavioral Changes</h3><p>Your cat may be more withdrawn and even start hiding. Our cats are bonded to us and like to be engaged and present where we are. When your cat is suddenly not greeting you at the door, not sleeping with you, and other engaging behaviors that are normal, this may be a sign that something's wrong.</p><h3>Less Activity and Low Energy</h3><p>You may notice that your cat has less energy or decreased stamina to engage in previously enjoyable activities, such as playing with toys or chasing that red dot. Your cat may be reluctant to jump, walk up and down stairs, have difficulty getting up from laying down, exhibit restlessness, and have difficulty finding a comfortable place to rest. You may also notice changes in sleeping patterns-the cat may sleep more or less and may sleep in unusual positions and places.</p><h3>Litter Box Changes</h3><p>Cats commonly will miss the litter boxes due to the pain associated with going in and out of the litter box, as well as difficulty squatting. Climbing into a high rimmed litter pan or holding the squatting position can be very difficult for a cat with sore hips or knees. Other medical issues can cause cats to not use the litter box due to pain and urgency associated with them.</p><h3>Increased Irritability</h3><p>Cats in pain can also uncharacteristically have episodes of aggression. A cat may begin to growl or hiss when people or other pets in the household approach it, may not be comfortable with being held and may resent being brushed or combed. They may bite or scratch, too, especially when a person touches or moves the painful area or if the cat anticipates you doing it.</p><h3>Changes in Appetite and Water Intake</h3><p>Cats who are experiencing pain may lose interest in eating and drinking. If you notice any changes in your cat's eating and drinking habits, be sure to alert your veterinarian. This can be a sign of pain and various other serious medical issues.</p><h3>Posture</h3><p>A cat in a lot of pain will appear as if it's trying to curl up into a ball or will sit hunched over in a guarded, crouched position with its back curved higher than normal, its head lowered, and front paws often folded under it. You may notice that once it lays down, the cat keeps its legs tucked up underneath itself instead of stretching out on its side. It may avoid or have difficulty engaging in scratching behaviors.</p><h2>What to Do If You Suspect Your Cat Is in Pain</h2><p>Do not give pain medications designed for humans or dogs to cats. Cats process drugs very differently from other species. Common pain medications used in humans can cause death in cats. Always seek veterinary care and consult your veterinarian for an appropriate pain therapy plan. Consult your veterinarian and address potential pain rather than letting your cat suffer in silence. Our cat companions rely on us to speak for them, so monitor your cats closely and alert the veterinarian to any concerns.</p>",944
142,https://www.thesprucepets.com/seizures-in-cats-3384635,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>Seizures in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Seizures in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Seizures affect a very small percentage of the feline population. They occur as a result of abnormal electrical discharges in the brain and manifest in various ways, some more severe than others. Seizures are distressing for both cats and their owners, and they can grow progressively worse if not treated. Because seizures can occur as a result of different brain dysfunctions, it's important to seek veterinary help to evaluate the cause of a cat's seizures so that a targeted treatment plan can be established.</p><h2>What Is a Seizure?</h2><p>Generally speaking, a seizure is what happens when something disrupts the brain's connection with the nerves in a cat's body. There are different causes and manifestations of seizures, but they are all electrical disturbances in the brain that come on suddenly and are involuntary. Some seizures involve violent movement in one or more areas of the body; others are much more subtle and resemble a trance-like state in which the cat is unresponsive.</p><h2>Symptoms of Seizures in Cats</h2><p>Seizures have a range of symptoms, some of which are more readily noticeable than others. In cats, they can be divided into two categories of symptomatic behavior called focal and generalized. While a few of these symptoms can indicate conditions other than seizures, their repeated occurrence should prompt a visit to the veterinarian for further investigation.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Focal Seizures</h3><p>During a focal seizure, a cat may cry loudly as though it is in pain, behave aggressively, even if it is not normally an aggressive cat, salivate or drool excessively, and exhibit other atypical behavior like obsessive tail chasing. Sometimes a cat will lose function of a leg, will appear to be chewing and staring off, or be unable to get up. You might also see specific areas of your cat's body (eyelids, mouth, ears) flutter. Despite a potentially dazed appearance, cats remain conscious during focal seizures. It's important to note that focal seizures can turn into generalized seizures.</p><h3>Generalized Seizures</h3><p>A generalized (or grand-mal) seizure causes a cat to lose consciousness. The cat may fall over and start shaking uncontrollably. The legs may move in a paddling fashion, as though your cat is trying to swim, or they may become rigid and straight. Your cat's mouth may also open and close involuntarily. Its head may arch backward, and it may even urinate or defecate during a seizure. The severity and length of a generalized seizure can vary greatly.</p><h2>Causes of Seizures in Cats</h2><p>There are several causes of seizure in cats, ranging from unknown (idiopathic) causes to diseases to head trauma.</p><h3>What To Do During a Seizure</h3><p>If you suspect your cat is having a seizure, make sure you do what you can to prevent injury. Avoid moving your cat if possible unless it is in an unsafe place. In that case, use a towel to pick up the cat to avoid being scratched or bitten. Keep other animals in the household away from your cat during a seizure, and keep your cat safely confined after a seizure if it is disoriented and clumsy.</p><h2>Diagnosing Seizures in Cats</h2> <p>Your veterinarian will perform a thorough physical exam and diagnostic blood work to rule out easily found causes of seizures. More advanced diagnostics like an MRI or cerebral spinal fluid sampling and evaluation may be necessary if the cause is not readily apparent.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>The success of seizure treatment is usually dependent on the cause of the seizure. If the cause is unknown or due to past head trauma, a cat may be treated with medications to manage the frequency and severity of the seizures. Seizures that repeat at frequent intervals are usually treated with one or more anticonvulsant medications, usually for life.</p><p>If the seizures are caused by toxicity, that toxin will need to be removed from the body. This may involve bathing the cat if a topical flea medication was applied containing pyrethrin. Your vet may induce vomiting if the cat ingested a toxin or administer medications to counteract the effects of the toxin. Acute seizures due to toxic exposure will likely not require lifelong medication.</p><p>Seizures caused by brain tumors may be treated with surgery to remove the tumor. If surgery is not a viable option, then anticonvulsants may be employed to help suppress seizures and maintain your cat's quality of life as long as possible.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Seizures</h2><p>The prognosis for a cat with seizures varies widely based on the cause and severity of the condition. If there is no acutely life-threatening condition present (like a brain tumor), then anti-convulsant medications may be effective at managing the cat's seizures. Time and patience may be required to determine the appropriate dose for your cat, and these drugs often have side effects that must be monitored regularly monitored to also maintain your cat's overall health. Seizures induced by toxic exposure carry a guarded prognosis based on your cat's resilience to the poison and the efficacy of the supportive treatment your vet provides.</p><h2>How to Prevent Seizures</h2><p>Many seizures can not be prevented because they are caused by unknown neurological disturbances or brain tumors. However, you can prevent seizures due to toxic exposure by making sure your cat is not exposed to dangerous chemicals like pyrethrins, especially those in pesticides designed for dogs. Keeping your cat indoors will not only eliminate the need for chemical flea and tick preventatives but also help prevent seizure-causing head injuries due to car collisions and other types of trauma.</p>",894
143,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-not-peeing-but-acting-normal-4801627,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Can't Pee</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Can't Pee</h1><p>Do you suspect your cat is having trouble peeing? A urinary obstruction, or blockage, is an emergency situation. Learn how to recognize the signs of a urinary blockage so you can help your cat before it's too late.</p><h2>What Is a Urinary Obstruction?</h2><p>A urinary obstruction occurs when the urethra becomes blocked and urine cannot pass. This may be caused by sediment or crystals in the urine and/or inflammation in the urinary tract. Urinary obstructions are far more common in male cats than in female cats. This is because males have a longer and narrower urethra. The tiny amounts of sediment, mucus, or tissue inflammation can obstruct the urethra and make urination difficult or even impossible.</p><p>If a cat cannot urinate, the kidneys cannot perform their essential function of filtering toxins out of the blood and excreting them in the urine. Toxin levels in the body increase, making the cat very sick. Without medical attention, a blocked cat will eventually die.</p><p>Cats with urinary obstruction may or may not also have concurrent urinary tract infections. A urinary tract infection may be the cause or the result of the obstruction.</p><h2>Signs Your Cat Is Having Trouble Urinating</h2><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Cats are generally masters of hiding illness; this is a survival instinct for them. However, there are certain signs that can help you determine whether or not your cat is having trouble urinating.</p><p>The most obvious sign of a urinary obstruction is when a cat takes multiple trips to the litter box. If you see this happening, take a closer look. Observe your cat in the litter box. Is he straining to urinate, but not passing any urine? Is he urinating small drips only (no stream)? Look for signs of urine in the litter box. If your cat has been to the box several times but the litter is dry or has no clumps, then it's likely he is not passing urine. If you see your cat straining with little or no urine coming out, then he is probably blocked.</p><p>Other signs of urinary blockage include extreme lethargy, increased water intake, loss of appetite, and general discomfort. Cats may display restlessness by vocalizing or pacing. Or, they may hide and avoid contact with people and other pets because they are in pain.</p><p>Cats with urinary problems may show certain signs before becoming fully obstructed. If your cat has been urinating outside the litter box for the last few days or you notice blood in the urine, bring your cat to the vet. This can help prevent an obstruction.</p><h2>What to Do If Your Cat Can't Pee</h2><p>If you suspect your cat is having trouble urinating on his own, it's essential that you bring him to a veterinarian . If your regular veterinarian is closed, you should bring your cat to the nearest open veterinary hospital, even if it means going to an emergency clinic. A blocked cat will die, possibly within 24 hours, without veterinary treatment.</p><h2>Treatment of Urinary Obstructions in Cats</h2><p>Cats with urinary obstructions typically need to stay in the hospital for a few days for treatment and observation.</p><p>When you arrive at the vet, be sure to let them know right away that your cat can't urinate. They will quickly feel your cat's kidneys to determine if they are enlarged. A cat with a urinary obstruction typically has a large, firm bladder that can be felt easily by a professional. The bladder feels this way because it is overfilled with urine that has no way out. Without treatment, the bladder may rupture. Or, the toxin buildup and kidney dysfunction will lead to death.</p><p>If your cat is indeed obstructed, then the team must begin work immediately. The veterinarian will draw blood to check for electrolyte imbalances. Next, the vet will typically sedate the cat and attempt to place a rigid urinary catheter. This can be very difficult to do when there is material blocking the urethra. It can take several attempts to pass the catheter.</p><p>Once the rigid urinary catheter is in, the vet will collect a urine sample and then flush out the bladder with sterile saline. The urine will be analyzed for signs of infection, blood, crystals, and other abnormalities. Most vets will switch out the rigid catheter with a flexible one for the cat's comfort. This will be sutured in place and attached to a closed collection system (tubing and a bag to collect the urine). The cat will also get an intravenous catheter to provide fluids. Intravenous fluids will flush toxins out and clear debris from the bladder. The urinary catheter allows this to take place more efficiently and prevents re-obstruction.</p><p>During hospitalization, the vet may treat your cat with pain medications, anti-inflammatories, antibiotics, and/or other medications to help with recovery. The exact treatment depends on the cat's signs and the results of lab tests. A special urinary diet may be started when necessary.</p><p>After one to three days of fluids and urinary catheterization, the vet will remove the urinary catheter and observe the cat, making sure he can urinate on his own before sending him home.</p><p>Male cats that continue to get blocked may need special surgery to enlarge the urethra. This surgery is called a perineal urethrostomy. It involves the removal of the penis and the creation of an opening for urination. As gruesome as it may sound, this surgery can majorly improve a cat's health and quality of life if he struggles with obstructive urinary issues.</p>",900
144,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-drooling-554028,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>What to Do If Your Cat Drools</h1>,"<h1>What to Do If Your Cat Drools</h1><p>It's normal for cats to drool while kneading or purring-they're just so relaxed. You may see some saliva or spit bubbles on the side of your cat's mouth when they're stressed or afraid. But there are health causes that could cause cat drooling as well, such as exposure to a toxic, dental disease, or trauma to the mouth. Determining the cause comes down to assessing the situation, knowing your cat, and involving your veterinarian when necessary.</p><h2>Normal Drooling in Cats</h2><p>It's common for some cats to drool while they are kneading or purring. Drooling is often a sign of relaxation and contentment that can be traced back to kittenhood. While nursing, kittens often knead their paws on their mothers to stimulate milk release. These behaviors result in a comforting and satisfying meal as well as a nurturing bond between mother and kitten. When cats reach adulthood, feelings of contentment often lead to kneading, which then stimulates drooling because of the connection to nursing. Purring often accompanies the kneading and drooling.</p><p>If your otherwise healthy cat is in your lap and starts ""making biscuits"" and purring, don't be surprised if some drooling occurs. This is perfectly normal and likely even one way that your cat shows you love.</p><p>Unlike dogs, cats don't commonly drool at the sight of food. However, it can still happen. If your cat drools at the sight or smell of food, but not at other times, then it's probably nothing to worry about.</p><p>Stress or fear may cause a cat to drool temporarily, such as during car rides, vet visits, or loud events. If your cat seems extremely stressed regularly, it's a good idea to talk to your vet about options. If the drooling and stress are short-lived and stop on their own, then there is likely little cause for concern.</p><h2>Abnormal Drooling in Cats</h2><p>If your cat's drooling occurs constantly, there may be a health problem going on. This is especially the case if the drooling cannot be associated with contentment or food. All cats should be seen by the veterinarian at least once a year for routine wellness exams, even if they seem healthy. The vet can often detect problems before your cat shows signs.</p><p>If abnormal drooling occurs in between routine vet visits, you should contact your vet right away. Your cat may need to be seen for an examination. There are several health issues that can cause drooling in cats and require medical attention.</p><h2>Oral and Dental Disease</h2><p>Cats can develop various oral and dental issues that can go undetected until they cause extreme illness or pain. This pain often causes the cat to salivate excessively. Mouth ulcers, tooth injuries, gum disease, resorptive lesions, and infections are some well-known causes of drooling in cats.</p><p>Your veterinarian will examine your cat's mouth to look for signs of dental and oral issues. If dental disease is seen, your vet will likely recommend professional dental cleaning with possible tooth extractions. This procedure must be done under general anesthesia.</p><p>Medications like antibiotics may be necessary to address your cat's dental and mouth issues.</p><h2>Nausea</h2><p>A cat that is nauseous or has been vomiting will often drool a lot. Nausea and vomiting in cats can have many causes, such as internal parasites, kidney disease, and gastrointestinal conditions. If your cat seems nauseous, is vomiting, or has a poor appetite, it's best to see the vet.</p><p>After the examination, your vet may recommend lab work to get a better look at organ function, blood cells, and urine content. The results can help determine the next steps for diagnostics and treatment options.</p><h2>Foreign Body</h2><p>If your cat has something stuck in his mouth, it is likely to cause drooling. A string is a common oral foreign body, but other possibilities include toy parts and even grass. If you see a string hanging out of your cat's mouth, DO NOT pull it out. The string may be wrapped around something in the stomach or intestines and pulling can cause major damage. Instead, get to the nearest open vet office.</p><h2>Toxin Exposure</h2><p>Cats that have licked, chewed on, or ingested a poisonous substance can develop excess salivation. This includes poisonous plants, caustic chemicals, and toxic foods. Some topical toxins, such as pesticides or flea and tick preventatives not meant for cats, can cause drooling as well. If you suspect your cat has been exposed to something toxic, bring your cat to the nearest open veterinarian right away.</p><p>If you see something else in your cat's mouth, proceed with caution before trying to remove it. Not only can you cause further injury to your cat, but you might also get bitten! It's always best to get to the vet for an oral foreign body.</p><h2>Trauma</h2><p>Injuries to the mouth can often lead to excessive salivation. Cats that have chewed on electrical cords might suffer oral burns that lead to drooling. A cat that has been hit by a car may have a broken jaw that causes drooling. Cats that have oral injuries from cat fights often drool. You may not be able to see evidence of an injury on the outside, but the drooling is a sign that you should see the vet.</p><p>If your cat is drooling and you can't find an obvious normal reason, please contact your veterinarian. Cats are experts at hiding illness. They often do not show there is a problem until they feel very sick. When in doubt, don't wait. Call the vet.</p>",898
145,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-vomiting-up-brown-liquid-4775185,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Is Vomiting Up Brown Liquid</h1>,"<h1>What to Do if Your Cat Is Vomiting Up Brown Liquid</h1> <p>Cats can vomit for a multitude of reasons and what they vomit can be just as varied. Brown vomit, though, can be a sign of a serious illness. Vomiting itself is what is considered to be a nonspecific symptom. It could be associated with an array of health concerns. Some of these can include things like allergic reactions, internal obstructions, pancreatitis, kidney failure, parasitic infections, liver disease, inflammation, poisoning, or nervous system disorders. But what could be causing your cat to vomit brown liquid specifically?</p><h2>Causes of Your Cat Vomiting up Brown Liquid</h2><p>Bleeding in the Gastrointestinal Track: Brown vomit can be indicative of bleeding. If your cat has been vomiting chronically for some time, there may be inflammation in the mouth and/or esophagus that could be oozing blood. If your cat hasn't been chronically vomiting, brown liquid vomit may be indicative of internal bleeding further down the gastrointestinal track. This could be the result of something like a foreign body ingestion or a large hairball impaction that is blocking the intestines and creating inflammation and trauma.</p><p>Brown Bile: Sometimes brown liquid vomit can be bile from your cat's liver. Vomited bile is usually yellow in color, though, so if it is determined that the brown liquid your cat is vomiting is bile, that could be a sign of a problem with your cat's internal organs.</p><p>Food: Of course, most cat food, whether dry kibble or canned, is some shade of brown in color. If you cat is a habitual 'scarf and barf' cat or if they have intestinal sensitivities, that may be causing them vomit up partially digested or undigested food. If your vet has ruled out other medical issues and thinks that what your cat is vomiting up is actually food, they may want you to try a commercial, sensitive systems food with your cat. If your cat is still struggling with vomiting food on this special diet, they may then want to put your cat on a strict, hydrolyzed protein diet.</p><p>When it comes to food allergies, most cats are actually allergic to the protein versus any other nutrient source. A hydrolyzed diet is a food that has gone through a process where the protein is broken down into its individual amino acid components. This prevents your cat's immune system from identifying the food as containing an allergen and prevents your cat from having symptoms of an allergy flare up.</p><h2>How to Stop Your Cat From Eating Too Fast</h2><p>Your vet may also suggest food puzzles for your cat. Food puzzles are a great source of both play and enrichment for your cat. There are more and more manufactured food puzzles available on the market that stimulate both your cat's predatory and foraging instincts. The added benefit of food puzzles for a cat that chronically vomits their food, though, is that it slows down the chow time so that a cat can't eat too quickly and then get sick from it. If your cat routinely eats out of puzzle feeders and is still vomiting up their food, talk to your vet about a change in diet. It may be that your cat has a food allergy that is the main culprit of their food vomiting and a change in diet may be what is needed to calm their GI system down.</p><h2>What Should I Do if My Cat is Vomiting Brown Liquid?</h2><p>Some cat owners may describe their cat as 'puke-y' but it should be noted that frequent vomiting is never normal for a cat. Chronic vomiting or when it has been occurring for more than two or three weeks is definitely a sign of a problem. If your cat is vomiting brown liquid several times and/or in conjunction with other symptoms such as lack of appetite, weight loss, lethargy, or diarrhea you should make an appointment with your vet right away. Your vet will want to start with a physical exam, checking your cat's vital signs, including temperature, and palpating your cat's abdomen.</p><p>After a thorough examination, your vet may also want to run some tests, including blood work and x-rays. Blood work will check your cat's organ function, making sure that there are no signs of liver disease or kidney disease, as well as your cat's red blood cell and platelet levels. An X-ray study will check for any fluid in the abdomen that could potentially be blood and it may also show intestinal gas patterns that could be indicative of a blockage.</p><p>Depending on what your doctor finds, your cat may require hospitalization for fluid therapy and supportive care or they may just need outpatient treatments and oral medications to go home on. If your vet suspects your cat has an intestinal blockage your cat may require surgery to remove whatever the blockage is.</p><p>Even if the reason is something as benign as eating breakfast too quickly, routine vomiting in a cat is never a normal activity. If you're struggling with a vomiting cat, call your veterinarian to see if they can help you determine what is ailing your cat can how you can help them fell better.</p>",852
146,https://www.thesprucepets.com/signs-your-cat-is-sick-4165142,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>18 Signs That Your Cat Is Sick</h1>,"<h1>18 Signs That Your Cat Is Sick</h1><p>It's important you be able to recognize the signs a cat is sick. It may be difficult to know if subtle changes in your cat indicate a health problem. Cats are experts at hiding illness. In the wild, this instinct can protect them from predators or other cats that might be a threat. Common signs that a cat is sick are vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, lethargy, increased thirst, and many more. Learn the 18 most common symptoms for cats and what situations are an emergency.</p><h2>Signs That Your Cat Is Sick</h2><p>By the time you actually notice something is wrong with your cat, it might have been going on for a longer amount of time than you think. Note subtle changes in behavior and watch for more. Observe your cat's demeanor and body language. Does something seem off? Learn what is normal for cats and know what is normal for cat. Never ignore obvious signs of illness. When in doubt, contact your vet for advice.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If your cat is not breathing normally, it may be best to go to an emergency clinic. If the signs are very mild, see your regular veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>There is another reason why cats and many other animals are less likely to show pain or illness: They simply do not have an emotional relationship with their discomfort. Animals tend to accept the pain or illness as the new normal and move on. It may not be until they are extremely ill that their sickness becomes obvious to humans.</p><h2>Emergency Situations and Your Cat</h2><p>Certain situations may be considered urgent. You shouldn't wait for an appointment at your vet when your cat is experiencing an emergency. Keep information about after-hours veterinarians handy in case you need to rush to one. If you see the signs of an emergency, do not delay.</p><p>If you notice anything else your cat does that worries you, it's better to be safe than sorry. You can call your vet or the emergency vet if you need help deciding if something is an emergency.</p><h2>How to Prevent Illness in Cats</h2><p>Many owners underestimate the importance of routine veterinary care for cats. They may wait several years to bring their cats to the vet for check-ups. Worse, they sometimes wait until their cat is sick. It's understandable that people would want to avoid putting their cats through the stress of a veterinary visit. Some cats become very anxious or even aggressive at the vet. Rather than waiting, try to find a veterinary practice that is less stressful for your cat. Many feline-friendly practices are out there, some even cat-only practices.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>If you don't want to go through the stress of getting your cat into a carrier and taking it to the vet, you may consider finding a mobile vet who can come to your home. Many cats do better in a familiar environment.</p><p>Annual veterinary exams are essential for cats. Senior cats can benefit from biannual check-ups and routine lab work. These visits give the vet an opportunity to examine your cat when he appears healthy. The vet may find minor abnormalities on the exam that indicate a minor problem before your cat gets really sick. Early detection might mean you and your vet can take action before the illness becomes serious.</p><p>You can also keep your cat as healthy as possible by feeding a healthy diet. A healthy diet can help your cat avoid obesity and a wide array of other health issues. Many vets recommend wet diets high in protein and low in carbohydrates.</p><p>Be sure to use routine parasite prevention as recommended by your vet. This can prevent fleas, intestinal parasites, and other parasites from making your cat sick.</p><p>Provide a happy, low-stress home for your cat. Keep fresh water available at all times and plenty of clean, accessible litter boxes in your home. In smaller homes or multiple-cat homes, provide vertical space like cat trees and wall shelves.</p><p>While many positions that cats sleep in can indicate pain, the most serious is if they're sleeping with their hind legs and back arched, and their paws beneath their body. This position may indicate your cat needs medical attention. Please call your vet!</p><p>If your cat's not eating, you need to call your vet before you think about tricks to get it to eat! Once it's squared away that your cat is okay it's time to load it up with certain foods that either act like appetite stimulants (liver and tuna, for example), or a high-calorie supplement.</p><p>Cats are solitary, and more so when they are under the weather. While hugging your ailing cat might make feel better, it's likely not what your kitty wants. The best way to comfort your sick cat is to provide it a warm and quiet place to sleep, make sure it has easy access to its box and food-perhaps you can move them closer?-and let it rest.</p>",815
147,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-has-uti-symptoms-5425539,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>What to Do If Your Cat Has UTI Symptoms</h1>,"<h1>What to Do If Your Cat Has UTI Symptoms</h1><p>A urinary tract infection, or UTI, occurs in cats when disease-causing bacteria infiltrate and overcome the body's immune defenses and then multiply within the urinary tract. This causes discomfort and inflammation in the cat's urinary tract and can result in the cat urinating outside of the litter box in other areas of the house.</p><p>UTIs can occur anywhere along the urinary tract, from the urethra, which is the tube that passes urine out of the body, to the bladder and even up to the kidneys. When the infection is located in the bladder, it is called bacterial cystitis. Fungi, parasites, and viruses can also cause cystitis in cats. Cats who have recently been given antibiotics tend to be more at risk of fungal cystitis, but it is still rare even in those cases.</p> <p>UTIs caused by bacteria represent only a small number of the cases where cats are diagnosed with a urinary tract disease. In young cats, UTIs are relatively uncommon. Bacterial infections are seen more often in cats over ten years old, and UTIs have been found to occur in many more cats with urinary tract disease in this age range. Female spayed cats, Persians, and Abyssinians are also at higher risk of developing UTIs.</p><p>UTI symptoms resemble other urinary tract diseases, and any time a cat shows changes in normal behavior, like suddenly urinating outside of the litter box or spending an unusually long time in the litter box, it is important to have the cat assessed by a veterinarian as soon as possible. </p><h2>Causes of UTI in Cats</h2><p>UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter and adhere to the urinary tract, where the bacteria grow and cause disease and inflammation. In a healthy bladder, high urine flow helps to flush out bacteria and serves as one of the body's natural defenses against infection. In cases where urine flow is slower or lower than normal (for instance, if the cat doesn't drink much water), this can create an environment where bacteria can remain within the urinary tract and have the opportunity to multiply and adhere. Other factors within the urinary tract that create an environment where bacterial infection can occur include changes in pH levels (a measurement of how acidic the urine is) and abnormal levels of organic acids and urea.</p><p>is the most common bacteria found in UTIs, although many other types of bacteria can cause infection as well. Often, these same bacteria reside on the skin or in the gastrointestinal tracts of cats and spread to the urinary tract when given the opportunity and an environment that promotes their growth.</p><p>Certain underlying conditions predispose cats to developing UTIs. These include chronic conditions like diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, bladder tumors, and obesity. Cats that have been given drugs to suppress their immune systems or who were born with abnormal anatomy in the urinary tract are also more likely to get UTIs. Cats who have had urinary catheters placed recently for a surgery or other medical procedure are also at higher risk of infection.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If your cat is showing symptoms of a UTI, take the cat to a veterinarian; they can diagnose the condition and determine the proper treatment. Do not wait if you are seeing symptoms. Some conditions that resemble UTIs, such as a blockage of the urethra that prevents cats from being able to pass urine, can be life-threatening. Because the symptoms of UTIs can look like other conditions that are not bacterial, it is necessary for your veterinarian to perform additional tests to make sure that antibiotics are warranted. UTIs are diagnosed based on physical examination, a history of the symptoms, and blood and urine tests. In most cases, a sample of urine from your cat will be sent to a laboratory to determine if a bacterial infection is present, and antibiotics will be selected based on the type of bacteria identified. If a UTIis diagnosed, your veterinarian will prescribe antibiotics to treat your cat. Additional medications or supplements may also be given to increase your cat's comfort level and overall bladder health. The veterinarian may also recommend a different diet for your cat. If the cat has an underlying condition that is predisposing it to developing UTIs, your veterinarian will also discuss the prognosis and treatment plan for any chronic or concurrent diseases with you.</p><h2>How to Prevent a UTI in Cats</h2><p>UTIs can occur in cats of any age or breed, but there are some actions you can take to minimize the risk of a UTI in your cat.</p><h2>Follow-Up Care</h2><p>It is important to give all medications as directed to treat your cat's UTI and attend all follow-up appointments. In some cases, your veterinarian may perform additional tests on your cat's blood and urine to ensure that the infection has been cleared. </p>",792
148,https://www.thesprucepets.com/help-for-a-deaf-cat-553945,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Symptoms,<h1>How to Care for Your Deaf Cat</h1>,"<h1>How to Care for Your Deaf Cat</h1><p>There is no reason your deaf cat shouldn't have a happy, fun-filled life. Some pets are born deaf or are genetically predisposed to deafness. For example, blue-eyed white cats can be born with a condition that results in deafness. At other times, illness or injury may lead to hearing loss. With a few accommodations, deaf cats shouldn't have any trouble in most households.</p><h2>Before You Begin</h2><p>It's important to understand cat hearing when living with a deaf cat. Normal cats hear much better than we do and youthful pets generally hear better than middle-aged and older animals. Cats more or less hear the same low-pitched sounds as humans, but they are far better at higher frequencies. At typical volumes, cats can hear up to around 79 kHz. People can only hear sound waves up to 20 kHz. Your cat can hear sounds in a 10.5-octave range, a wider span of frequencies than almost any other mammal. That allows your cat to easily hear extremely high-pitched sounds like rodent squeaks.</p><p>With age, the delicate structures of the inner ear begin to lose their sensitivity to vibration. This normal age-related hearing loss, called presbycusis, develops in every pet that lives long enough, just as it does in aging people. Hearing loss can be accelerated by damage from loud noises. Chronic ear infections and other illnesses or injuries may also result in hearing loss.</p><p>Cats can 't tell us that they 're hard of hearing, and they compensate well by paying more attention with their other senses. They may meow loudly (because they can't hear themselves), watch owners and other pets more closely, and cue off of their behavior to know that somebody 's at the door, for example. Deaf pets may also pay closer attention to vibration and air currents. The breeze made by an open door may cue them you 've come home from work. Even when they can 't hear the can opener, the cat 's internal clockwill announce suppertime. All of this means that you may not notice hearing loss in your cat until it is quite profound.</p><h2>What You Need</h2><p>If you suspect hearing loss, speak with your veterinarian. The doctor can determine whether a medical problem is to blame and recommend appropriate treatment.</p><p>Make some noises outside of your cat's line of sight like tearing paper, jingling keys, crunching foil, or tapping on a cardboard box. Use various sounds to test high and low frequencies. If your cat ignores some or all of the noises, there is likely hearing loss. A specialty veterinary center can confirm with a Brainstem Auditory Evoked Response (BAER) procedure.</p><h2>Communication</h2><p>It is still possible to communicate with a deaf pet. Use visual or tactile signals rather than your voice. Cats easily learn to respond to hand signals, the beam of a laser pointer, or a light flicked on and off to come for dinner. Deaf pets startle more easily. Always approach your pet so he sees you coming, and stomp your foot or give him some other warning before petting him to avoid being accidentally nipped or scratched when you startle him.</p><h2>Focus on Vibrations</h2><p>A dog whistlethat uses high-frequency sound waves may still be detectable to your hearing-impaired pet even when it can no longer hear your voice. Low frequency vibrations may be felt, even when your pet can 't hear. A vibrating collar is also be a great way to get your cat's attention. Use that as a signal to call your pet and as a training device.</p><p>A pet locatormay be helpful when your cat can 't hear you, and you can 't find it. Attach a pendant to the cat 's collar that emits a light tone when the transmitter is activated. A key finderproduct should work well for this purpose.</p><h2>Keep Them Indoors</h2><p>There are far too many threats outdoor for deaf cats. They can't hear barking dogs, honking car horns, or people yelling, ""Watch out!"" Provide your cat with a comfortable seating area next to a window where they can look outside and see all that's going on.</p><p>Deaf cats are still happy pets. Some hearing loss is a normal part of the aging process for both cats and humans. Making simple accommodations for a hearing-impaired pet isn 't difficult. Besides, it 's what we do for all our friends and family, and our cats are no exception.</p><h2>Prevention</h2><p>Depending on the cause of the deafness, it may not be preventable. Some hearing loss due to aging is natural and cannot be stopped. Treat bacterial infections, ear mites, or other health problems quickly and with the assistance of your vet. Left untreated, some of these health conditions can result in permanent hearing loss.</p>",780
149,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-cats-eat-bugs-555032,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Toxins,<h1>Insects That Are Toxic to Cats</h1>,"<h1>Insects That Are Toxic to Cats</h1><p>It is not uncommon for cats to hunt insects, and even sometimes eat them. Many common insects are harmless to cats, but some can be poisonous or cause injury. Even non-poisonous bugs can cause vomiting or other gastrointestinal issues if too many are consumed. In many cases, the pesticides used to control insect problems are more harmful than the insect itself.</p><p>As a loving cat owner, take the time to educate yourself about the risks of different insects. If you see your cat has eaten all or part of an insect, you will know how to handle it. Here are the insects that are poisonous to cats, and those that aren't cause for concern.</p><h2>Poisonous Spiders</h2><p>Most spiders, especially small house spiders, are generally harmless to cats. However, any poisonous spider that can harm people can also harm your cat. Because your cat is much smaller than you, venom from a spider bite can do more damage to them than it could to you. Black widow spiders are poisonous to cats. Other common poisonous spiders to watch out for include the Brown Recluse and Hobo Spider. Poisonous spider bites can cause major illness or even death. Some bites cause localized reactions that turn into major wounds. Others, like that of the Black Widow, cause vomiting and diarrhea, paralysis, drunken gait, and muscle tremors.</p><p>If you suspect your cat has been bitten by a poisonous spider, get to the veterinarian right away. If your cat ingests a spider, the venom is unlikely to be a problem, as the stomach acids tend to counteract the venom. However, you should still observe your cat closely for a day or two in case any signs of illness appear.</p><h2>Wasps, Bees, and Other Stingers</h2><p>Flying, buzzing insects are very tempting for playful cats. However, their stings can be painful. As in humans, it is possible for a cat to have an allergic reaction to a sting and experience anaphylaxis, though this is uncommon. It is more likely that the cat will lick at the site where she was stung and further irritate the area.</p><p>If your cat was stung by a bee, your vet may advise giving diphenhydramine, an anti-histamine. It's a good idea to keep this on hand, but do not give it unless advised to do so by a veterinarian. If your cat experiences swelling, vomiting, breathing issues, or a strong reaction to the sting, it's best to go to the vet immediately.</p><h2>Butterflies, Moths, and Caterpillars</h2><p>Most moths and butterflies pose no risk to cats. This is fortunate since cats really enjoy pursuing these fancy fliers. Some caterpillars will sting, causing pain to your cat. The stings from common caterpillars are rarely dangerous, but some large, exotic caterpillars can be toxic.</p><p>The Garden Tiger Moth, pictured above, may be poisonous if ingested (as well as the caterpillar). However, little is known about the toxic effects on cats.</p><p>If you are trying to keep clothes moths away, your best bet is to use cedar. Mothballs are very poisonous to cats. Eating just one mothball can cause toxicity. That's because mothballs are really just solid, concentrated pesticides. Signs of mothball toxicity include vomiting, lethargy, weakness, breathing trouble, tremors, and seizures.</p><h2>Centipedes</h2><p>Small house centipedes are generally harmless to cats. You might be relieved to find your cat ridding your home of these creepy crawlers. However, centipedes have venom and can bite to capture prey. Larger centipedes may be able to bite your cat. This could lead to a localized reaction or more serious issues like fever and weakness. If you suspect your cat has been bitten by a centipede, be sure to watch the area closely. You may need to go to the veterinarian if your cat shows any signs of illness.</p><p>The Giant Redheaded Centipede (pictured above) and the Texas Redheaded Centipede can be very toxic or even deadly. Fortunately, these are unlikely to be found in your home.</p><h2>Scorpions</h2><p>If your cat plays with a scorpion, she is likely to be stung. At the very least, a scorpion sting will be painful for your cat. It will likely cause a localized reaction. In more serious cases, cats can develop vomiting, trouble breathing, or other unusual behavior.</p><p>This is something to be especially aware of if you're a resident in Arizona. If you know you live in an area where scorpions are prevalent, be aware of the risk to your cat. If you think your cat has been stung by a scorpion, it's best to go to the veterinarian.</p><h2>Ants</h2><p>Most ants are harmless to cats. Large black ants may bite cats, but these tiny bites cause no harm. Fire ants, on the other hand, can be very dangerous to cats. Their venomous bites are painful and can even cause a serious allergic reaction, the worst of which can lead to anaphylaxis. If your cat has been bitten by fire ants, it's best to visit the vet just in case.</p><p>Note that chemical ant killers can pose a significant health risk to cats. The poisons can lead to serious issues for cats. Be sure to use pet-safe products.</p><h2>Roaches, Beetles, Crickets, and Grasshoppers</h2><p>Hard-bodied insects like roaches, beetles, crickets, and grasshoppers are typically non-toxic to cats. However, ingesting their exoskeletons can cause oral irritation and gastrointestinal upset.</p><p>Roaches may carry parasites that can affect cats. This is even more reason to keep your cat on a monthly preventive product that deworms.</p><h2>Fleas, Ticks, Mosquitoes, and Flies</h2><p>Fleas are very common in cats and can cause itchiness and even anemia. Contrary to popular belief, fleas are common even in indoor-only cats. Cats often ingest fleas while grooming, which can cause a tapeworm infection. Monthly flea control products are important to avoid these issues.</p><p>Ticks are more likely to appear on cats that go outdoors, but any cat can get ticks. The danger of ticks is the fact that they are vectors for disease. Tick-borne illness can cause a host of problems in cats. If you see ticks on your cat, talk to your vet about the best option for tick prevention.</p><p>Mosquitos are mainly a nuisance to us, but they can transmit fatal heartworm disease to cats. Because cats are not ideal hosts for the heartworm, infection is uncommon. However, when a cat does get heartworm disease, the worms take up residence in the lungs. There is no treatment available for heartworms in cats. That's why monthly heartworm prevention is recommended.</p><p>Flies may be fun for cats to catch, but they can also be a problem. Some cats are susceptible to fly bites on their ears, especially cats that live outdoors. When cats have fly bites on their ears, a fly repellant cream may be used to deter the flies.</p><p>The cuterebra, or botfly, is known to lay its eggs on the skin of animals. The larva burrows under the skin and matures. When this happens in cats, it looks like a small lump under the skin topped with a tiny, perfectly round hole. As it matures, you may be able to see the larva, which looks like a large maggot. If you notice this in your cat, do not attempt to remove the maggot. Visit the vet so it can be properly removed and your cat treated for a secondary infection.</p>",1194
150,https://www.thesprucepets.com/houseplants-safe-for-cats-4798542,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Toxins,<h1>9 Houseplants Safe for Cats</h1>,"<h1>9 Houseplants Safe for Cats</h1><p>It can be pretty overwhelming walking into a garden center or home improvement store and seeing all the different options you have for houseplants. Some plants need more sun than others, thrive in more humid environments, or may even be toxic to your cat. Knowing which plants are safe options to have around your cat can prevent a lot of potential issues in the future. The following plants are good options for cat owners to consider.</p><h2>Orchids</h2><p>Orchids are beautiful houseplants that come in a variety of vibrant colors and species and are readily available for purchase. These bright flowering plants are tall and delicate but are also safe to have around cats. They require very little water and should not be kept in direct sunlight but a little humidity in a warm environment is preferred. Orchids don't take up much table or floor space but they do get quite tall.</p><h2>African Violets</h2><p>A classic tabletop houseplant, these plants with small flowers are often seen in garden centers in small pots. They are known for their small purple or pink flowers but can come in a variety of colors as well. Different varieties of African violets may have differently shaped leaves and are sometimes confused with another type of plant called Gloxinia, which is also non-toxic to cats. African violets do best in bright sunlight in a place that is warm and humid. They don't take up very much space and are typically inexpensive.</p><h2>Spider Plants</h2><p>Spider plants have been popular houseplants for decades thanks to their fun, hanging appendages. These leafy plants can be hung from the ceiling or set on a shelf allowing the plantlets to dangle. These plants are also easy to care for since they don't demand a lot of sunlight or specific temperatures. Even if your cat takes an interest in the hanging plantlets that grow from the spider plant, it's good to know that these plants are safe to have around your feline friends.</p><h2>Boston Ferns</h2><p>Another classic houseplant that is easily found in garden centers and home improvement stores, the Boston fern is a full, leafy plant that easily fills an empty space in a windowsill. Cats may bat at the leaves so it is good to know that this plant is not toxic to them if they were to munch on a fallen leaf. Boston ferns enjoy humidity and bright but indirect light but temperatures are not that much of a concern if your house gets a little cooler in the winter. Repotting in the spring is recommended to keep these plants happy, even if they haven't outgrown their current pot, and you can separate the plant into multiple plants at this time to create an even larger greenspace for you and your cat to enjoy.</p><h2>Polka Dot Plants</h2><p>is the scientific name for this fun houseplant commonly known as a polka dot plant. It's vibrantly colored leaves have patterns that look like freckles or dots making it a unique option to add a little more color to a leafy green space. Polka dot plants are safe if a cat were to chew on its leaves but if they eat a large amount of the plant, some vomiting and/or diarrhea may result. These plants like bright light and if they aren't in enough light they won't develop the classic patterned leaves so if your polka dot plant only has solid green leaves growing, it's a sign you should give it more light.</p><h2>Bromeliads</h2><p>Bromeliads come in a variety of colors and even patterns and are starting to be found more regularly in homes. While these plants are non-toxic to cats in small amounts, eating a large amount of the leaves can lead to GI upset including vomiting or diarrhea. The variety is the most commonly seen type of bromeliad. These plants like similar conditions as orchids so many people end up having both types of houseplants in their collection. Bromeliads need bright but indirect sunlight and fast-draining soil to thrive but are adaptable to a much wider variety of temperatures than you would think since they are naturally found in rainforests.</p><h2>Haworthias</h2><p>Succulents are very popular houseplants because of their variety of shapes, textures, and low-maintenance. Haworthia is also known as the zebra cactus but it doesn't have those prickly spines often seen on other cacti. This succulent is a great option for homes with cats, especially if your space is small. Haworthias come in different sizes with some only needing the space of a teacup to live. They do like bright, indirect light, but like most cacti, these plants don't need much water, especially in the winter months.</p><h2>Gloxinias</h2><p>Sometimes confused with African violets, Gloxinia is a colorful houseplant that is also safe for cats. The flowers are more bell-like than African violets but the same lamb's ear-like leaves are also found on this houseplant. These plants do best in indirect but bright light and needs constantly moist soil with temperatures staying in the 70's.</p><h2>Areca Palms</h2><p>If you are looknig for a larger houseplant that is safe to have around your cat then you may consider an areca palm. These trees need bright but indirect light alongside moist soil and a lot of nutrients. They may not be the easiest to care for if your thumb isn't very green but they are wonderful for creating a large indoor greenspace that's also safe for a cat.</p><p>While there are a plethora of safe houseplants for cats, there are also some plants that can be very toxic. Be sure to research the plant you plan on purchasing before adding it to your home. Some examples of toxic houseplants for cats include lilies, azaleas, crocuses, birds of paradise, carnations, chrysanthemums, daisies, daffodils, dalias, sago palms, and many more. If your cat ate a plant and you aren't sure if it is toxic, contact your veterinarian or a pet poison hotline as soon as possible.</p>",976
151,https://www.thesprucepets.com/human-food-and-cats-551947,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Toxins,<h1>Human Foods That Are Poisonous to Cats</h1>,"<h1>Human Foods That Are Poisonous to Cats</h1><p>Some cats will beg and plead for human food, especially when they see you eating. Giving your cat any table scraps or tidbits of human food is a dangerous practice that should not be encouraged for multiple reasons. First, cats need the nutrients that are specifically provided for them in good, premium cat foods, and any ""extras"" that they consume will take away their appetites for their regular meals. A sliver of turkey or chicken from your dinner plate certainly won't kill a cat, but you're helping it develop bad habits.</p><h2>Human Foods Are Not Meant for Cats</h2><p>The main reason to discourage feeding cats ""people food"" is that there are a number of foods that are toxic to cats. While it is tasty and harmless to humans, a simple nibble could be life-threatening for your cat. If you are a cat owner, it's important to familiarize yourself with the everyday foods that can be dangerous, and even deadly, for cats.</p><h2>Foods That Are Toxic to Cats</h2><h3>Green Tomatoes and Raw Green Potatoes</h3><p>These foods are members of the Solanaceae family of plants, which includes the Deadly Nightshade, and contain a bitter, poisonous alkaloid called , which can cause violent lower gastrointestinal symptoms. The leaves and stems are particularly toxic. Don't worry if you see tomatoes included in pre-made pet foods. They are made with ripe tomatoes and should cause no concern because they appear in relatively small amounts.</p><h3>Chocolate</h3><p>While it's widely known that chocolate is dangerous for dogs, it's also toxic to cats. Theobromine is the offending substance and can cause chocolate toxicity in a cat. This substance is found in the highest concentration in dark and unsweetened chocolate.</p><h3>Grapes and Raisins</h3><p>These foods' toxicity has mainly been found in dogs, in quantities of varying amounts. The ASPCA advises: ""As there are still many unknowns with the toxic potential of grapes and raisins, the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center advises not giving grapes or raisins to pets in any amount."" There is no reason to risk a dangerous situation, so it's best to keep these fruits away from your cat.</p><h3>Avocado</h3><p>While avocado is healthful for humans, it is mildly toxic to cats. The leaves, seed, tree bark, and the fruit itself contain Persin, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea in cats. Avocados are very rich and high in fat, which can lead to gastroenteritis or pancreatitis. Be especially aware if you have a bowl of guacamole out at a party. You do not want your cat eating any of this snack or licking a spoon or fork that was used to make it.</p><h3>Alcohol</h3><p>All types of alcohol can be toxic to pet cats. While a small lick of an alcoholic beverage is not lethal, consuming a lot can be. If you are hosting a party and serving alcohol, be sure to thoroughly clean up the drinks and avoid leaving large punch bowls or open alcohol containers overnight, as your cat might be prone to consume more. Alcoholic beverages aren 't the only potential sources of alcohol poisoning in cats. Alcohol exposure can also occur from ingestion of hand sanitizer, mouthwash, fermenting fruits, and bread dough that contains yeast.</p><h3>Onions, Garlic, & Related Root Vegetables</h3><p>Onions contain a substance () that destroys red blood cells in the cat, causing a form of anemia called . Garlic is similar in that it can also cause red blood cell damage and anemia. It's dangerous for cats to consume a full clove of garlic or any large pieces of raw onion. Cats can also be exposed to garlic and onion in the form of powder, which can be found on chips, soups, and seasonings.</p><h2>Other Foods to Avoid</h2><p>There are a number of foods that are not toxic to cats, but they should be avoided. Meat trimmings, raw eggs, and caffeinated beverages should not be consumed by pet cats. Although milk is not toxic to cats, it may have adverse effects. Adult cats that are fed a nutritious diet don't need milk. Also, many cats are lactose-intolerant, which means that the lactose in milk and milk products produces stomach upset, cramps, and gassiness. Xylitol, a sweetener, is deadly to dogs and can cause hypoglycemia and potential liver failure. The Pet Poison Helpline has not indicated its toxicity to cats, but it does not seem worth the risk. If you see this ingredient in any food items, make sure to avoid sharing with your cat.</p><h2>If You Think Your Cat Has Been Poisoned</h2><p>Contact your veterinarian or the ASPCA National Animal Poison Control Center right away at 1-888-426-4435 or Pet Poison Helpline at 1-800-213-6680 right away. Share any information you have, including what they might have eaten and the symptoms you are seeing. There may be a charge for speaking with the poison control line.</p><p>While it's best for cats to eat cat food, these ""human"" foods are safe for your cat: thoroughly cooked lean meats that haven't been seasoned with onions or garlic, fish with the bones removed, hard-cooked eggs, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.</p><p>Keep your cats from eating human food by never offering it to them, even just ""licking the plate,"" and by keeping it out of reach at all times in your kitchen (this includes covering it on the countertop while you're eating).</p>",871
152,https://www.thesprucepets.com/are-lilies-poisonous-to-cats-3385489,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Toxins,<h1>Lily Toxicity in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Lily Toxicity in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Nia M. Perkins, DVM is an accomplished veterinary expert with two decades of hands-on small animal clinical experience in private practice and shelters. She founded the award-winning mobile veterinary practice, ""The Housecall Vet,"" and co-founded a small animal and exotics hospital.</p><p>Lilies are sometimes grown in the garden or as houseplants, but the most common presentation is in floral arrangements, especially around Easter and Mother 's Day. If you have cats and you love lilies, be careful, because they are extremely poisonous to cats. The entire plant is toxic to cats, thus just one bite can make your cat very sick, and if they are not treated within a reasonable amount of time, death may occur. Unfortunately, there is no antidote for lily toxicity, and treatment is not always effective, so it is important to know as much as possible about this plant and the effects you may see if your cat is exposed to it.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>If you think your cat has ingested a lily plant, this is a life-threatening emergency. Seek veterinary care immediately and have your veterinarian contact an animal poison control center.</p><h2>What Is Lily Toxicity?</h2><p>The exact nature of the lily toxin is unknown, but all parts of the lily plant are harmful to cats. The most dangerous and potentially fatal lilies for cats are found in the genus Lilium and Hemerocallisbut there are other varieties that are harmful as well. If you have a cat, we recommend keeping these plants out of your home, and if your cat goes outdoors, out of your garden as well</p><h2>Symptoms of Lily Toxicity in Cats</h2><p>If you have a bouquet of lilies in your home or grow lilies in the garden, be alert to any sign that your cat has licked or eaten the plant, such as sudden lethargy or vomiting. If this occurs, look to see if you can spot any obvious bite marks or other indications that your cat has eaten any part of the lily's petals or leaves.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The first signs of lily toxicity in a cat may be seen as early as two hours. In the beginning, you may notice lethargy (low energy level), a loss of appetite, and vomiting. As the condition progresses, tremors and seizures may occur. Prolonged exposure to this toxin will result in dehydration, renal failure, and death if left untreated. Lily of the valley is a little different in that it does not cause renal failure but may cause heart failure.</p><h2>Cause of Lily Toxicity</h2><p>Your cat doesn't have to eat an entire lily plant to become sick. In fact, as little as a nibble or two of a leaf or flower petal can harm your cat, as can licking bits of pollen off the plant, table, or the cat's own fur, or even drinking water out of the flower vase containing the lilies.</p><h2>Diagnosing Lily Toxicity in Cats</h2><p>Your veterinarian will diagnose lily toxicity based on your cat's assumed ingestion of any part of a lily plant, combined with symptoms. Along with a full physical examination, your vet may want to run blood tests to determine if there has been damage to the cat's kidneys.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If you suspect your cat has ingested any part of a lily plant, even if there may have been a possible exposure to the pollen, seek veterinary attention immediately. If your regular animal clinic is closed, contact the nearest emergency hospital. It will be helpful if you know which lily the cat was exposed to and the amount it consumed. You may be asked to contact animal poison control, so have their information handy.</p><p>The earlier you bring your cat in for treatment, the best chance it has for survival. If you know that it's only been a very short time since your cat ingested the lily, the vet might induce vomiting to remove as much toxin from the stomach as possible. Or your veterinarian may perform a procedure known as decontamination. Your cat will be given a thick oral liquid-often containing activated charcoal-that will bind to the toxins and move them out of the body through the gastrointestinal tract. Aggressive fluid therapy initiated within 24 hours of ingestion may prevent anuric renal failure, where the kidneys stop producing urine. In more severe cases, dialysis is the only effective treatment. Be prepared for your cat to be hospitalized for several days.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Lily Toxicity</h2><p>Ultimately, your cat's prognosis depends on how much lily has been consumed, the cat's general state of health, and the length of time since the lily ingestion. As a general rule, if more than 18 hours pass without treatment, the prognosis is poor. However, many cats recover if treated promptly.</p><h2>How to Prevent Lily Toxicity</h2><p>The best way to keep your feline friend safe is to keep these plants out of your home and yard. But if you find that your cat has already helped itself to the lily in your flower arrangement, seek veterinary attention immediately. Just remember, the sooner the problem is identified and treatment is initiated, the better your cat's chance of survival.</p><h3>Tip</h3><p>When buying flowers or ordering them for delivery, remember to leave out the lilies. It's advisable to specifically instruct florists not to include any lilies in the Lilium species such as stargazer, Asiatic, Oriental, or tiger lilies. Giving florists the scientific name of the flower species can help avoid confusion.</p><h2>Safer Flowers</h2><p>If you want to find a safer option than lilies, here are a few that will not cause harm to your cat and will look beautiful in a floral arrangement.</p>",918

Some may cause kitty just a little discomfort, and other plants can be lethal.</p><p>The plants outlined are some of the more popular plants that can harm your cat. This is not an exhaustive list and you'll also want to refer to the ASPCA's toxic plants list to ensure your pets stay safe in the garden as well as with any houseplants inside the home.</p><p>If you believe your cat has eaten any of these even if it is not showing signs of being sick, contact your veterinarian or call the Animal Poison Control Center immediately.</p><h2>Azalea</h2><p>Azaleas are a member of the Rhododendron family. All plants in this family are moderately toxic to cats, including all parts of the plants. According to The Purdue University College of Veterinary Medicine, ""these ornamental shrubs aren 't commonly nibbled on but they can cause fatal heart problems in dogs, cats, and pet birds.""</p><p>The ASPCA Poison Control Center is more guarded about these types of flowers and warns against pet owners planting them in their garden. The clinical signs of consumption include vomiting, diarrhea, weakness, and cardiac failure.</p><h2>Chrysanthemum</h2><p>Chrysanthemums (also simply called mums) are popular perennials that provide a lovely burst of fall color. There are a variety of chrysanthemum species-including common daisies-whose leaves and stems are poisonous to both cats and dogs.</p><p>Cats who ingest those parts of the plant may vomit, drool, or get diarrhea. You can also look for signs of lethargy, stumbling around, lack of appetite, or skin irritation.</p><h2>Daffodil</h2><p>The daffodil (also known as narcissus, jonquil, or paper white) is the traditional harbinger of spring, right alongside tulips, which are also poisonous to cats. While they are beautiful, these pretty flowers (along with their stems, leaves, and bulbs) can cause vomiting, diarrhea, convulsions, low blood pressure, tremors, and cardiac arrhythmias if consumed by your cat.</p><p>When it comes to plants grown from bulbs, including daffodils and tulips, it is the bulb that is most toxic to pets. If you have these in your garden, you might need to take measures to discourage your cat from digging up the bulb.</p><h2>Hydrangea</h2><p>Hydrangeas are found in many home gardens because of their beauty and immense popularity as dried flowers in arrangements. Their toxicity level to cats is moderate and ingestion may result in stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness if the flower heads are ingested. Be sure to keep the flowers out of your cat's reach even when drying them.</p><h2>Iris Bulbs</h2><p>Irises are favorite flowers in old-fashioned gardens, where they were once known as ""flags."" They are fairly safe to use in gardening, once planted. Although all parts of the plant are dangerous to cats, it 's the bulbs that can cause gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p>Take precautions if your cat (or dog) likes to dig. It may also be wise to keep your cat inside while you transplant or divide irises.</p><h2>Ivy</h2><p>Ivy is commonly used as ground cover or for shade, as in covering gazebos or trellises. It's also a popular house plant. Many species of ivy-including the popular English Ivy and ivy arum (or pothos)-are considered moderately toxic to cats.</p><p>These plants can cause gastrointestinal symptoms and burning or irritation in the mouth, along with breathing difficulty, coma, or even death, if a sufficient amount of leaves are ingested. The berries are not as poisonous to cats, though they're not safe, either.</p><h2>Lily</h2><p>Lilies come in many varieties and all look quite different from each other. As popular as they are, unfortunately, these flowers are on the ""least wanted"" list of plants in a garden for cats. Ingesting any part of the plant can cause kidney failure and ultimately lead to death.</p><p>This precaution also applies to other ""lily"" plants, including lily of the valley and both the orchid and bush that go by that name. To be safe, it's best to avoid any plant with lily in its name. Ingesting even small amounts, including pollen that gets on a cat's fur and is then ingested, can be enough to be lethal, so they should be avoided in all situations when cats are around, including in bouquets, houseplants, and outdoor gardens.</p><h2>Marigolds</h2><p>Marigolds are sturdy, perky little annuals. They are colorful and exceptionally easy to grow, which is why they're so popular. Their pungent aroma helps keep insects at bay and they are commonly planted near roses to deter aphids. If your cat eats marigold leaves or stems, it may suffer from mild mouth irritation, possible drooling, tummy pain, and diarrhea. Contact from the plant's sap may also cause skin irritation.</p><h2>Wisteria</h2><p>Wisteria is naturally a vine, but it has been trained to grow as trees by some horticulturists. The seeds and pods are the toxic part that should be a concern to pet owners. Cats who eat these may experience vomiting (which may be bloody), as well as diarrhea, dehydration, and depression.</p>",856
154,https://www.thesprucepets.com/is-neosporin-safe-for-cats-4768907,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Toxins,<h1>Is Neosporin Safe for Cats?</h1>,"<h1>Is Neosporin Safe for Cats?</h1><p>It may be tempting to slather Neosporin on your cat when you see it has a wound. But this first-aid kit staple, otherwise called triple antibiotic ointment, isn't recommended for use on cats. Neosporin can cause skin irritation and allergic reactions in cats. If you want to create a first-aid kit for your feline companion, skip the Neosporin and keep an ointment from the vet on hand along with some other essentials for cat first-aid.</p><h2>What Is Neosporin?</h2><p>Neosporin is the trade name for a triple antibiotic ointment created by the Johnson & Johnson company. It is made up of three different antibiotics: neomycin, polymixin B, and bacitracin. Neosporin (or generic, non-brand name triple antibiotic ointment) that is labeled as ""pain relief"" contains a fourth ingredient: a topical analgesic (pain reliever) called pramoxine hydrogen chloride.</p><p>In combination, the three topical antibiotics in Neosporin are effective at keeping wounds bacteria-free. They are very safe for topical use in people. In cats, topical application may cause mild skin irritation or an allergic reaction, if the cat is sensitive to one or more ingredients, but other than that there are no major side effects to topical usage. If ingested in large enough quantities, however, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea, anaphylactic shock (a severe allergic reaction), or even death.</p><p>If Neosporin is meant to be used topically, how leery should one be if the component has such an adverse effect only when ingested? Remember that cats groom themselves daily, especially if it is feeling uncomfortable from their wound or the greasy ointment. Additionally, if you keep the ""pain relief"" variety on hand, the pramoxine hydrogen chloride additive can cause further skin irritation in cats.</p><p>For these reasons, despite the fact that Neosporin is technically safe for topical use in cats, it is not actually recommended for use in cats. The Animal Poison Control Center lists it as a medication that is toxic to pets.</p><h2>Are There Alternatives to Neosporin?</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no over-the-counter alternative to Neosporin in cats. However, there are veterinary-specific ointments that can be prescribed in place of Neosporin. If your cat has a minor wound, schedule an appointment for your cat to be looked over by your vet. They can prescribe the right treatment for your cat's wound. In the event that your vet discovers that your cat's minor wound isn't so minor after all, you're already in the right place to have it addressed.</p><h2>Can I Do Anything at Home?</h2><p>If your cat does wind up with a small injury, there are things you can do at home, after consulting with your vet. If there is active bleeding, apply gentle pressure to the wound with sterile gauze if your cat will tolerate it. Once you have the bleeding wound under control, check your cat over for any other wounds. If your cat is in too much pain to permit this kind of treatment, get it to a veterinarian right away for further care and pain management.</p><p>If you find a wound on your cat but it is no longer actively bleeding and it appears to be minor-small and not deep-you can gently clean the wound with a dilute antiseptic solution such as povidone-iodine. You can clean around the wound with sterile gauze and saline solution.</p><p>If you find any wounds that appear deep or look like a puncture wound, simply clean around the wound with saline and bring your cat to your veterinarian or a local emergency clinic right away.</p><p>Every cat owner should be prepared for an emergency that would require at-home care. Keeping your cat's first aid kit stocked with Neosporin may not be recommended, but there are certainly plenty of supplies that you can and should stock it with. First and foremost, your cat's first aid kit should have the phone numbers of your veterinarian, local emergency vet hospitals, and ASPCA Pet Poison Control (1-888-426-4435).</p><p>You should also have a copy of your cat's vaccine history, pertinent medical records, a photo, and microchip number if your cat is microchipped. Your cat's first aid kit should have sterile gauze squares and non-stick or telfa pads. Blunt-ended bandaging scissors can be helpful to cut these materials. Povidone-iodine and saline solution should also be included in your kit to clean minor wounds. A properly fitting E-collar, or pet cone, is also important to prevent your cat from licking or chewing at its wound, which can make the injury worse and/or introduce infection.</p><p>If your cat allows you to take a rectal temperature, a rectal ""fever"" thermometer and water-based lubricating gel should be included. Make sure the thermometer is a ""fever"" thermometer as cats have a normal temperature that can be as high as 102.5 degrees Fahrenheit, so regular thermometers may not be able to read your cat's temperature, especially if they have a fever.</p><p>Every cat owner wants to be able to help their pet when they need it. Keeping a well-stocked first aid kit is essential. Just make sure you keep the Neosporin out of the cat's first aid kit and in your own personal kit.</p>",837

While some cat owners may consider marijuana similar to catnip, they are not at all the same. In households where there is marijuana present, residents should be informed of the health dangers that marijuana poses to cats.</p><h2>Catnip and Marijuana</h2><p>Catnip is a plant that comes from the mint family. The perennial herb has downy leaves, purple-spotted white flowers, and a pungent smell that makes cats go crazy when smelled and sleepy when eaten. Marijuana, on the other hand, comes from a plant called . The chemical in Cannabis that produces the altered states of consciousness humans enjoy is called Delta-9 Tetrahydrocannabinol or THC.</p><p>Marijuana is sometimes prescribed for relief from pain and nausea due to chemotherapy in cancer patients, and for certain conditions in AIDS patients. However, it's still questionable whether there is anything beneficial in the plant for feline friends. In fact, it is strongly suggested that cats do not come close to any smoke from marijuana use, or any other smoke from cigarettes, cigars, or pipes.</p><h2>How Cats Are Exposed to Marijuana</h2><p>The most common ways cats are exposed to marijuana is by inhaling smoke or ingesting dried marijuana. Although people who have experimented with smoking catnip become happy and relaxed, cats should not be forced to ""smoke"" any substance.</p><p>Because of the cumulative effects of inhaling any kind of smoke, it is inadvisable to smoke marijuana anywhere near a cat, particularly one with asthma or other lung diseases. It's important to be mindful of this, as humans are able to make educated decisions around topics like these, while cats are not.</p><p>In some cases, cats may nibble on the leaves and/or buds of the growing marijuana plant. Humans may also feed their cats cookies or brownies made with marijuana. This is a double whammy of injury to the cat, as the brownies and/or cookies may also contain chocolate, which is toxic to cats on its own.</p><h2>Symptoms</h2><p>According to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), your cat may experience extreme sleepiness or excitation, hypersalivation, dilated pupils, or low blood pressure. There may also be instances of low body temperature or even death (although it's rare).</p><p>If your cat demonstrates any of the symptoms above, you should take it to the veterinarian as soon as possible.</p><h3>Warning</h3><h2>Medical Marijuana for Painful Conditions</h2><p>The American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) publishes several articles about marijuana treatments and drug monitoring programs for animals. In 2017, AVMA House of Delegates members urged the Association to develop policies and guidance around marijuana treatments at the Veterinary Information Forum. One of the topics discussed included the increase of toxicity cases. Delegates like Dr. Dick Sullivan encouraged more research to be performed and for the national association to write to or petition the FDA in order to address marijuana issues to clients.</p><p>One article published in June 2013 tackled veterinary marijuana and pet owners who are looking to legalize marijuana for painful symptoms of the disease. The article quoted a woman who owned a 12-year-old labrador-retriever type of dog which had a tumor of the spleen metastasized to his liver and lungs. Unfortunately, the dog had been given two months to live, and the tramadol given for the pain was not doing the job. Of course, the poor dog was obviously in pain and completely inactive.</p><p>Because California legalized marijuana for humans, the dog's owner was able to buy a glycerin tincture of marijuana that's sold as a pet medicine in licensed medical marijuana dispensaries throughout Los Angeles. The dog's improvement in activity and the easing of pain was such that the pet owner recommended the drug to other dog owners.</p><h2>Alternatives</h2><p>Under the same circumstances, it's understandable that many pet owners wouldn't hesitate to give medical marijuana to their own cats if it were available in their state. Thus, there needs to be more research and medicines available for cats experiencing pain.</p><p>Until it's legal for vets to prescribe cannabis to pets, they won't have the authority to prescribe the drug. Overconsumption of THC may also create serious health risks in cats. However, hemp-based treatments high in Cannabidiol (CBD) can help. With more research, it's possible that there is a dosage that can help cats with conditions like Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), pancreatitis, arthritis, asthma, and cancer.</p><p>There are vitamins and oils that can act as a medication or supplement for your cat. Additionally, there are holistic and integrative veterinarians who can work with you to find the right product for your cat.

156,https://www.thesprucepets.com/saddle-thrombus-in-cats-5199512,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Saddle Thrombus in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Saddle Thrombus in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Saddle thrombus, more properly called feline aortic thromboembolism (FATE), is an often fatal condition caused by a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the cat's rear legs. It tends to strike suddenly and causes severe pain along with paralysis of the hind legs. Although the underlying cause of the condition is usually heart disease, the saddle thrombus is the first symptom of heart trouble in more than 75 percent of affected felines.</p><p>Any cat can develop FATE, but it is somewhat more common in adult cats between the ages of 8 and 12, in male cats, and in Abyssinian, Birman, and Ragdoll breeds. Unfortunately, the outlook for a cat with saddle thrombus is poor, as only 50 percent of cats survive with treatment. Still, the other half do survive, and with rapid treatment, your cat may be among that half.</p><h2>What Is Saddle Thrombus?</h2><p>A saddle thrombus occurs when a blood clot becomes lodged in the base of the aorta where it branches off to each of the cat's rear legs. Your vet will probably refer to the condition as feline arterial thromboembolism or feline aortic thromboembolism.</p><p>The aorta is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle of the heart to other parts of the body, including the rear limbs. The region where the aorta branches off to the rear legs is called the saddle due to its shape.</p><p>The term ""thrombus"" describes a large blood clot that forms inside a blood vessel or within the heart. An embolus is a small clot that breaks off of a thrombus and then becomes lodged in a blood vessel. Together, these conditions are called thromboembolism, which is obstruction of blood flow caused by an embolism from a blood clot.</p><p>Feline aortic thromboembolism (FATE) occurs when a blood clot develops in the heart, and then part of that clot breaks off and becomes lodged in an artery, obstructing blood flow. The saddle region is a common area for clot obstruction. A saddle thrombus is a painful event that occurs suddenly and disrupts circulation to the rear part of the cat's body. This is an emergency situation that can lead to death.</p><h2>Symptoms of Saddle Thrombus in Cats</h2><p>Many cat owners, when discovering their cat crying out in extreme pain, unable to move its hind legs, and hyperventilating, assume that the cat must have had some sort of trauma or been hit by a car. However, those are the primary symptoms of a saddle thrombus.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Feline arterial thromboembolism happens suddenly, causing rear limb paralysis or paresis (partial paralysis). Your cat may be unable or unwilling to stand or walk at all, or might attempt to walk, but limp or drag the affected legs.</p><p>Owners typically notice sudden vocalization and heavy breathing along with the inability to move the rear limbs properly. It may look as if the cat suddenly has a broken back. Upon further investigation, you may see that the paw pads are pale or bluish-gray in color and cold to the touch, due to the reduced blood flow. Your cat might vomit from the pain and stress, and may lash out aggressively, try to hide, act anxious, or display other unusual behaviors due to the severe pain and fear.</p><h2>Causes of Saddle Thrombus</h2><p>A saddle thrombus is typically caused by a blood clot that formed in the left atrium of the heart. Approximately 89 percent of cats with arterial thromboembolism have underlying heart disease, although often the owners are unaware of their pet's condition.</p><p>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common type of heart disease seen in cats, and most often the reason for a saddle thrombus, although only a small percentage of cats with HCM ever develop FATE. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes an inward thickening of the heart muscle walls, reducing the space inside the heart and impeding its ability to properly pump blood to the rest of the cat's body. The condition leads to turbulent or sluggish blood flow within the heart, making it easier for blood clots to form.</p><p>Once a thrombus, or blood clot, has formed within the cat's heart, it may break apart into smaller pieces that then are pumped out into the cat's aorta and from there into the smaller blood vessels. Eventually, the clot can become stuck within a blood vessel, which reduces or stops blood flow through the remainder of the vessel. While it is most common for the blood clot to become stuck at the cat's ""saddle,"" that is not the only possibility. Blood clots can also affect the front legs, kidneys, or brain; while not as common as saddle thrombus, these are also very serious scenarios.</p><h2>Diagnosing Saddle Thrombus in Cats</h2><p>Often, your veterinarian will be able to diagnose saddle thrombus based on the characteristic symptoms of sudden paralysis of the hind legs, extreme pain, and rapid or labored breathing. Your cat will be thoroughly examined, and the vet will pay special attention to checking for a pulse in the hind legs-it's often absent or reduced with a saddle thrombus-as well as any temperature changes in the cat's hind feet.</p><p>The veterinarian will use a stethoscope to listen to the cat's heart as well as the breath sounds within the cat's lungs. Often, the underlying heart disease will cause unusual heart rhythms or sounds that help the vet make the diagnosis. Other tests that might be ordered include x-rays or ultrasound to visualize the heart and blood tests to assess the cat's kidney function as well as overall organ function.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Feline arterial thromboembolism can be difficult to treat. Sadly, saddle thrombus has a poor prognosis, especially if the signs are severe (low rectal temperature, slow heart rate, total loss of motor function in the hind legs). In addition, cats with existing heart disease have a high chance of recurring embolisms. Euthanasia is sometimes the most humane option and is the route chosen by up to 75 percent of cat owners who have a cat that develops saddle thrombus.</p><p>If the decision is made to begin treatment, the cat will be admitted to the veterinary hospital for close monitoring and nursing care. The veterinary team will attempt to stabilize the cat with intravenous pain medication, symptomatic treatment, and, if necessary, oxygen therapy.</p><p>Cats recovering from arterial thromboembolism are often treated with antithrombotic (anti-clotting) drugs such as clopidogrel or aspirin. These medications can help prevent future clots from forming. Often, the cat will also receive diuretics or other medications for any underlying heart disease. It is possible for the exiting clot to be resorbed and the cat may regain limb function. However, there is a high risk of new blood clots forming over the next few weeks to months.</p><p>Cats are monitored closely for several days in the hospital. They may receive physiotherapy, including passive manipulation of the affected limbs to reduce muscle contraction and avoid limb deformity. Cats that survive to discharge will typically go home on medications and with instructions for at-home physiotherapy.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Saddle Thrombus</h2><p>Generally, the prognosis is poor for cats that develop FATE. The majority are euthanized upon diagnosis of saddle thrombus, especially if the cat is also in heart failure due to the underlying hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which is common. For those cats receiving treatment, only half survive to be released from the veterinary hospital, and of that half, only 20 percent survive another year. The best odds are for cats who do not have severe underlying heart disease and regain hind leg function within a few days.</p>",1238
157,https://www.thesprucepets.com/heartworm-in-cats-3384697,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Heartworms In Cats</h1>,"<h1>Heartworms In Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Although far likelier to infect dogs, cats can also become infected by heartworms. These parasitic worms take up residence inside the right side of the animal's heart, along with the large blood vessels between the heart and the lungs. Once in place, these sizable worms cause inflammation, damage to the blood vessel walls, and restrictions to blood flow that can cause symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, vomiting, weight loss, and lethargy. In severe cases, the cat may go into respiratory distress that can be fatal.</p><p>Don't assume that only outdoor cats get heartworms: Around one-third of infected cats are indoors-only. All it takes is the bite of a mosquito for your cat to become infected, which can happen indoors or outside.</p><p>Because it is far more difficult to treat heartworms in cats than in dogs, the best course of action is prevention. Here's what you should know about the symptoms, causes, treatment, and prevention of this dangerous parasite.</p><h2>What Is Heartworm Disease?</h2><p>Heartworm disease is caused by an infection with the parasitic roundworm . Heartworm larvae enter the cat's body when an infected mosquito bites the cat. Because cats are not ideal hosts for heartworms, (dogs are the ideal host) the larvae may become weakened and succumb to the cat's immune system before causing any problems in the cat. This is why it's somewhat uncommon for cats to develop full-blown heartworm disease. Many show no symptoms at all.</p><p>However, if the immature heartworms can survive long enough to travel to the arteries of the lungs, they create an inflammatory response generated by the cat's immune system. This can cause serious complications like heartworm-associated respiratory disease (HARD), which leads to coughing and trouble breathing. It can be even worse when an adult worm dies, however. When this happens, toxins are released that can damage the lungs. The death of just one adult worm can be enough to cause sudden death. Other cats may develop chronic lung problems.</p><h2>Symptoms of Heartworms in Cats</h2><p>Not all infected cats will appear ill. Some will have no symptoms at all, while others show only vague signs that are common to many disorders. Sadly, a small number of cats will show no signs until they suddenly collapse or die.</p><p>In cats that show symptoms, there are two points during the infection that they are likeliest to appear: when the immature worms reach the arteries in the cat's lungs and heart and when adult heartworms die.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>Symptoms of heartworms in cats can resemble many other illnesses, including feline asthma or viral respiratory infections. That can make it tricky to recognize the signs of this potentially very serious infection.</p><p>If immature worms take up residence in the cat's lungs and associated arteries, respiratory symptoms are the most obvious sign of infection. The cat will typically cough and gag, may breathe more rapidly than normal (tachypnea), and can appear short of breath or as if laboring to breath. If the inflammation is severe enough to cause respiratory distress, the cat may suddenly collapse or die.</p><p>Cats with mature heartworms can develop chronic, vague symptoms of illness, including intermittent vomiting or diarrhea, loss of appetite that leads to weight loss, and general lethargy or fatigue.</p><h2>Causes of Heartworms</h2><p>Heartworms, more properly called are parasitic worms that reach impressive lengths. Females can be as long as 14 inches and up to 1/8-inch in width. Males are generally much smaller, but still large in relation to the small blood vessels in a cat's heart and lungs.</p><p>Heartworms require two hosts to complete their lifecycle: an intermediate host and a definitive, or primary, host. The intermediate host is always a mosquito. The definitive host for heartworms is most often a domestic or wild dog, but cats and ferrets can also serve this role, although not nearly as effectively.</p><p>In the usual heartworm lifecycle, female worms infecting a dog release their larva, called microfilariae, into the dog's bloodstream. If a mosquito bites the dog and ingests its blood, it also takes in the microfilariae, which over the next two weeks or so develop into infective larva inside the mosquito. At this point, if the mosquito bites another dog, it passes the larva back into the animal, where the worms mature into adults over the next six to seven months, eventually mating and producing more microfilariae. In a dog's heart, the worms can live as long as seven years.</p><p>In a cat, however, far fewer worms survive to mature into adults. Those that do take on average a month longer to produce microfilariae than in a dog. Typically, 80 to 90 percent of dogs with heartworm disease have microfilariae in their bloodstreams, compared to around 20 percent of infected cats. Heartworms also don't generally live as long in a cat as in a dog; two to four years is typical. And overall, infected cats generally have far fewer adult worms than do dogs. An infected cat might have as few as one or two worms, compared to an average of 15 worms in a dog and potentially hundreds of these dangerous parasites. Nor do adult heartworms grow as large within a cat's heart as they do in dogs.</p><h2>Diagnosing Heartworms in Cats</h2><p>It is more difficult to definitively diagnose heartworm disease in cats than in dogs. An antibody test may be performed, but this only verifies that the cat has been exposed to heartworms. It cannot confirm-nor does it rule out-the presence of immature worms in the cat. Another blood test that's often used is the heartworm antigen test. This detects adult female heartworms very accurately, but only if there are at least two adult female worms present, which is often not the case with cats. A cat that has positive results on both of these tests is confirmed to have heartworms, but it is quite possible for an infected cat to have negative results on one or both of the tests.</p><p>Another blood tests looks for the presence of microfilariae in the cat's blood. If positive, that establishes a diagnosis of heartworms. However, since the majority of infected cats don't have larva in their bloodstream, a negative result cannot rule out infection.</p><p>Chest radiographs (X-rays) and echocardiography can reveal damage to the lungs and heart, consistent with heartworm disease. However, lung changes can look much like asthma and do not necessarily confirm the presence of immature heartworms.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment available for heartworm disease in cats. The treatment for dogs with heartworm disease is not suitable for cats, as it can cause serious side effects.</p><p>Supportive care is generally recommended for cats with heartworm disease that are not showing severe symptoms. This generally involves corticosteroids either intermittently or continually to reduce inflammation. If the cat suffers an attack of respiratory difficult, oxygen therapy is usually prescribed until the cat is once again stable. Diuretics to remove fluid from the cat's lungs might also be needed during a flareup of symptoms. Routine monitoring is also important to assess the cat's lungs and overall health.</p><h2>How to Prevent Heartworms</h2><p>Prevention is key when it comes to heartworm disease in cats. It is very difficult to treat an established heartworm infection in a cat, but there are several effective options to prevent infection before it begins. Many veterinarians recommend heartworm prevention for all cats, whether indoor-only or outdoors. And don't assume that your cat is safe just because you live in an area where heartworms aren't as prevalent as they are on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States; heartworms have been found in every state.</p>",1247
158,https://www.thesprucepets.com/giardia-in-cats-554950,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Giardiasis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Giardiasis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Not all cat owners may be familiar with giardiasis, but this infectious disease can cause serious symptoms when our feline friends experience it. Caused by the ingestion of a parasite, various genotypes of Giardia can infect cats, dogs, and even humans. Thankfully, giardiasis in cats is not usually contagious to other species. While this condition is treatable, it can be difficult to eradicate and often spreads quickly among groups of cats in homes, shelters, or catteries.</p><p>Cats typically experience diarrhea, although other symptoms like vomiting, lethargy, dehydration, and weight loss are possible. Giardiasis has symptoms similar to those of other intestinal diseases, so it must be diagnosed and treated by a veterinarian. Cats almost always recover fully from giardiasis. However, kittens or adult cats with underlying conditions may find it harder to recover.</p><h2>What Is Giardiasis?</h2><p>Giardiasis is a parasitic disease that occurs when cats eat, drink, or smell something that is contaminated by , a tiny single-celled parasite that infects the small intestines of its host animal.</p><p>The severity of the disease is variable, but it can cause serious illness in some infected cats. Most healthy adult cats do not experience severe symptoms from ingesting the parasite. However, giardiasis is highly contagious among cats in close living conditions and requires frequent sanitization procedures by owners to eradicate.</p><h2>Symptoms of Giardiasis in Cats</h2><p>Not all cats infected with Giardia become sick. Similar to cases of other common feline parasites, young kittens are more vulnerable along with adult and senior cats that have weakened immune systems. Giardiasis symptoms may be indicative of a number of other medical conditions (including IBD and cancer). Only a veterinarian can make an accurate diagnosis through examination and testing.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Diarrhea</h3><p>The most common symptom of giardiasis in cats is diarrhea, often with sudden onset and sometimes chronic. Diarrhea may be foul-smelling. Stools can be bloody, green in color, or accompanied by mucous or flatulence.</p><h3>Vomiting</h3><p>Many diseases that affect the intestines can cause vomiting. Vomiting happens in fewer cases of feline giardiasis than diarrhea, but it is possible in some cats.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>Owners may observe lethargic behavior in cats that have ingested Giardia. Your cat's normal energy levels can decrease significantly, and it might groom itself less. Lethargy is common in cats and other animals during periods of sickness similar to humans.</p><h3>Dehydration</h3><p>Dehydration may occur alongside vomiting and diarrhea. If your cat is not drinking enough water to maintain normal hydration levels while experiencing these symptoms, supportive care from your veterinarian may be required. This often includes treatments of IV fluids.</p><h3>Weight Loss</h3><p>Weight loss can be hard for owners to notice unless the cat's weight drops significantly, but your veterinarian can determine whether your cat's weight is normal. This commonly happens with a loss of appetite.</p><h2>Causes of Giardiasis</h2><p>Giardia undergoes two stages: a motile (swimming) stage and a cystic stage. Giardia cysts are the primary means of transmission from host to host. These cysts are hardy, resistant to both freezing and to chlorination of water, and can live for several months if not dried out or exposed to sunlight. This makes the spread of Giardia difficult to manage, as it can affect cats in a variety of situations.</p><h2>Diagnosing Giardiasis in Cats</h2><p>Giardia cysts can be identified in a fecal smear under a microscope. Since cysts are shed in stools sporadically, several different fecal samples may be needed for positive identification. Special stains may be needed, as the organism can sometimes be elusive.</p><p>Vets may need to use a zinc sulfate flotation solution, though they may also be able to see the Giardia on a smear. Another tool for identifying Giardia is called an ELISA test. This test looks for the presence of antibodies to Giardia in the cat's feces. Since Giardia can be hard to diagnose, a cat with giardiasis symptoms may be treated for Giardia even without a definitive diagnosis on the basis of medical history and symptoms.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Giardiasis is often treated with metronidazole, but there are several other oral medications available including fenbendazole. Because cats are very small, the pills are usually split, making them taste bitter; it is possible to find cat-friendly formulas that make the flavor less bitter. Severe diarrhea and vomiting can cause dehydration, which is dangerous for cats, it may be necessary to take special steps to be sure your cat is properly hydrated during recovery.</p><p>Along with treating cats to remove the infestation, owners need to take consistent steps to treat the cat's living environment at home. Use a mixture of chlorine bleach (1-2 cups diluted in 1 gallon of water) to disinfect surfaces around the house. Some household cleaners including Lysol can also be used, although pet owners should confirm with their veterinarian that the cleaner of their choice is effective on this specific parasite.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Giardiasis</h2><p>Most cats can fully recover from giardiasis, which typically takes between two and four weeks. However, young kittens and adult cats with other illnesses can experience more severe symptoms. If your cat is immunocompromised or undergoing another disease, take special care to follow your veterinarian's instructions very closely (including veterinary appointments for follow-up testing after treatment). Giardiasis can be fatal in some cases.</p><h2>How to Prevent Giardiasis</h2> <h3>Disinfect Litter Boxes Frequently</h3><p>Scrupulous scooping, cleaning, and disinfecting of litter boxes will help prevent the spread of Giardia to other cats. A mixture of chlorine bleach and water may be effective for litter boxes, and some catteries advocate steam cleaning of all surfaces where Giardia cysts might be present.</p><h3>Limit Outdoor Exposures</h3><p>Outdoor cats can be more likely to ingest Giardia in contaminated water. If your cat lives outdoors or frequently goes outside, take care to monitor the development of any symptoms closely. Owners with cats at risk of serious infection (kittens or those with other diseases) should limit outdoor exposures by keeping these cats in a safe, disinfected environment inside.</p><h3>Prevent Reinfection</h3><p>If you do have a cat infected with giardiasis, it's important to prevent reinfection. Wash your cat frequently and keep it isolated until all symptoms have cleared up. Disinfect food and water bowls, litter boxes, and household surfaces frequently.</p><h2>Is Giardiasis Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>There is a human form of giardiasis which, like feline giardiasis, is also caused by drinking contaminated water. In fact, Giardia is the most common form of traveler's diarrhea.</p><p>There are eight Giardia genotypes (A through H). Dogs are most often infected with genotypes C and D, while cats are usually infected with F. Humans are also vulnerable to giardiasis, and can be infected with types A and B. Because cats usually have type F, it is uncommon for strains to be passed from cats to people. However, in rare instances, cats can contract strain A or B, so owners should use proper sanitation procedures throughout any infections of pets. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after cleaning litter boxes and before handling food or touching your mouth.</p>",1131
159,https://www.thesprucepets.com/rapid-breathing-in-cats-4768732,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Rapid Breathing In Cats</h1>,"<h1>Rapid Breathing In Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Rapid breathing (tachypnea) is not a disease in itself, but can be a symptom of a potentially serious or even life-threatening condition. Note that it's normal, or at least not unexpected, for a cat to breath rapidly if it's anxious, overheated, or playing enthusiastically. But it's abnormal if a cat is breathing rapidly while at rest, particularly if it also appears lethargic or ill. If your cat is experiencing tachypnea, it can be a sign of a variety of issues from stress to heart disease and indicates that your pet is not getting enough oxygen through its system.</p><p>Cats are generally subtle in showing their caregivers signs of illness, so you must be especially vigilant to notice symptoms like rapid breathing. Being observant may help you to determine the cause of the rapid breathing or the situations in which it occurs. Because tachypnea can be a sign of serious illness, it's important to seek veterinary attention if your cat continues to breathe rapidly.</p><h2>What Is Rapid Breathing (Respiratory Rate) in a Cat?</h2><p>To know if a cat is breathing rapidly, you first need to know a healthy respiratory rate (breathing) for a cat, which is 20 to 30 breaths per minute when resting calmly or sleeping. Breaths should create small movements of the chest; if your cat 's sides are moving a large amount, this can indicate labored breathing. Be concerned if your cat 's breathing is abnormal. That means it 's unusually slow, fast, noisy (has a high, harsh, or whistling sound), or the cat is having difficulty breathing.</p><p>To measure your cat's resting respiration rate, count the number of breaths your cat takes while sleeping. One breath consists of your cat 's chest rising (inhaling) and falling (exhaling). Use your phone or watch to time 30 seconds and count how many breaths occur during that 30 second period. Next, multiply the number of breaths you counted by two to get the number of breaths in a minute. If your cat is breathing more than 30 times per minute while at rest, it is experiencing tachypnea.</p><h2>Symptoms of Rapid Breathing in Cats</h2><p>Because tachypnea is a sign of an underlying health problem, there are often a number of other symptoms that can occur along with the rapid breathing. Any breathing difficulty is a medical emergency and requires urgent veterinary attention.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><p>The most obvious sign of tachypnea in cats is rapid rising and falling of the stomach and chest, indicating that the cat is breathing faster than normal. Sometimes it will appear that your cat's sides are sucking in and out with each breath. You might see your cat try to ease its breathing by crouching down with elbows held out slightly from its body and its head stretched forward. A cat that is really struggling to breath will often pant through an open mouth, and might appear anxious or even panicky.</p><p>Depending on the cause of the rapid breathing, you may or may not hear abnormal respiratory sounds, such as whistling, wheezing, or groans with each breath. Your cat might even cough or gag. If the breathing difficulty is quite severe, your cat's gums might appear bluish, which indicates a lack of oxygen.</p><p>Other symptoms that can accompany breathing difficulties include a loss of interest in play or other activities, sleeping more than usual, loss of appetite, lethargy or depression, and irritability.</p><h2>Causes of Rapid Breathing in Cats</h2><p>Rapid breathing in cats is a symptom of a variety of illnesses and injuries and should be evaluated by your veterinarian right away. While some causes of tachypnea are mild and easily treated, many are life-threatening without rapid treatment.</p> <h2>Diagnosis of Rapid Breathing in Cats</h2><p>If your cat is breathing rapidly, consider any obvious factors that may be causing it and remove them from your cat's environment. Some factors include emotional distress and heat. If your cat is panting due to heat, for example, get them out of the heat as soon as possible and make sure to have water available to them. If your cat's breathing quickly returns to normal, then you know that the problem was a situational response and not an underlying health issue. However, if rapid breathing continues despite removing the possible cause, seek veterinary attention.</p><p>The veterinarian will perform an examination observing how your cat breathes, listening to their chest for evidence or abnormalities such as a heart murmur or fluid in the lungs. They'll also check the color of your cat's gums to indicate whether oxygen is being delivered to the organs effectively, and do a complete examination of the whole body.</p><p>Your veterinarian will most likely perform blood tests to check for underlying conditions and take X-rays and/or ultrasound to examine the lungs and heart.</p><h2>Treatment of Rapid Breathing in Cats</h2><p>Rapid breathing is a symptom of an underlying medical issue, and treatment varies depending on the severity of illness and diagnosis. If your pet is struggling to breathe, the veterinarian or veterinary technician may take it to the treatment area immediately upon arrival to stabilize your cat. This will include providing oxygen through a mask and placing an IV catheter to administer emergency drugs and fluids. If a foreign object is lodged in the cat's airways, the veterinarian will remove it manually if possible, or through an emergency surgery if the object cannot be easily reached.</p><p>In cases of pleural effusion, a thoracentesis may be performed to remove fluid from the chest, which will improve breathing and provide the veterinarian with a fluid sample for analysis. If heart disease is a concern, once your cat is stabilized, x-rays and an echocardiogram of the heart may be performed to evaluate the size and function of the heart.</p><p>Antibiotics, allergy medications, and anti-inflammatories will be prescribed in cases of infectious or inflammatory illnesses, or if the veterinarian suspects allergies are causing the problem.</p><p>If your cat is in respiratory distress, it is best to be as calm as possible. If traveling is stressful for your cat, your veterinarian will be able to best advise you on how to transport your cat.</p><p>Remember that if you think your cat is exhibiting rapid breathing, in most cases, this is an emergency. It is always safest to have your pet evaluated at the first sign of rapid breathing. If your cat exhibits rapid breathing that resolves after a few minutes, keep a journal of details including how long it lasted, what was happening before and after, and the date to share with your veterinarian. This will help your veterinarian narrow down potential causes and recognize possible triggers.</p><h2>Prognosis</h2><p>If your cat is breathing rapidly due to infection, allergies, or another simple health issue, then the problem should resolve with treatment. However, if the tachypnea is caused by heart disease, trauma, poisoning, or a tumor, the prognosis is far more guarded.</p><h2>Prevention of Rapid Breathing in Cats</h2><p>Because so many things can cause rapid breathing in cats, you cannot always prevent this symptom. But you can help ward off health issues by getting your cat regular veterinary checkups, feeding a balanced, healthy diet, making sure your cat is a healthy weight, and avoiding situations that might stress, frighten, or overheat your cat.</p>",1184
160,https://www.thesprucepets.com/treating-cat-chlamydia-5084586,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Chlamydia in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Chlamydia in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>When cats live in multi-cat homes, catteries, or shelters, they're more susceptible to the spread of infectious diseases. Feline chlamydia is a very common bacterial infection, and this illness can also spread to the lungs when left untreated. Unlike chlamydia in humans, this disease typically affects the eyes and upper respiratory tract in cats. Owners may notice symptoms like eye and nasal discharge, sneezing, fever, lethargy, and even squinted eyes.</p><p>Cats can develop this eye infection through direct contact with the bacteria when it is present on another cat. Any ocular or nasal secretions are considered to be infectious. doesn't survive long in the environment, so shared litter boxes, bowls, and toys (which should still be properly disinfected) are unlikely to cause transmission. Although any cat can become infected by young cats and kittens are the most susceptible. Caretakers can learn the signs of feline chlamydia along with prevention methods to help keep their cats healthy.</p><h2>What Is Feline Chlamydia?</h2><p>Chlamydia in cats (sometimes called chlamydial conjunctivitis) is a bacterial infection caused by the bacteria that typically infects the eyes and upper respiratory tract. This bacteria invades and infects a cat's eyes, nose, and throat.</p><p>is one of the most common causes of conjunctivitis in cats. While the transmission is unlikely between cats and humans, it is still possible for feline chlamydia to affect people that come into contact with infected cats-so caretakers should practice regular sanitization methods during any outbreaks.</p><h2>Symptoms of Chlamydia in Cats</h2><p>It typically takes between three and 10 days for cats exposed to chlamydia to develop symptoms. At this point, the symptoms become more severe, and they can persist longer when left untreated (which can lead to infections of the lungs). The most common symptoms of chlamydia in cats affect the eyes and upper respiratory tract.</p><h3>Eye Discharge</h3><p>Typically, the first sign of feline chlamydia infection is watery eye discharge. This can infect one or both eyes. This fluid will progress to a thicker, yellow, or even greenish-colored discharge. You may notice that your cat's eyes start to look noticeably irritated, and it may squint (holding one or both eyes closed due to pain).</p><h3>Sneezing and Nasal Discharge</h3><p>If your cat becomes infected with you may also observe mild sneezing and nasal discharge. Your cat may begin to sniffle as a runny liquid is emitted from its nose.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p>Similar to other infectious diseases, chlamydia can cause cats to develop a fever. The cat may shiver, appear weak, and have an increased heart rate.</p><h3>Lethargy</h3><p>Often accompanied by a fever and loss of appetite, your cat may become lethargic during a chlamydia infection. Seek veterinary attention to help ensure your cat doesn't become dehydrated.</p><h2>Causes of Feline Chlamydia</h2><p>Young kittens are the most susceptible to developing chlamydia, but this condition can affect any cat (especially those living in multi-cat households, catteries, and shelters).</p><h2>Diagnosing Chlamydia in Cats</h2><p>If you suspect that your cat has contracted it's important to schedule a veterinary exam as soon as possible. Upon arrival, your vet will perform a physical exam, including a thorough look at your cat's eyes.</p><p>Your veterinarian will need to determine whether your cat was exposed to or another bacterial infection that can affect the eyes. To confirm the diagnosis, they'll take a swab from the conjunctival membrane to be examined under a microscope in the laboratory after growing a culture.</p><p>The veterinarian may also perform a fluorescein stain to check for a corneal scratch or a Schirmer tear test to assess your cat's tear production. A corneal scratch can also cause an increase in eye discharge and eye squinting. Your cat may develop a corneal scratch or ulcer if it is rubbing its eye (due to pain) and accidentally scratches it. However, a positive fluorescein stain test is not a hallmark of chlamydial infection. Likewise, if your cat has dry eye, its eyes may produce a thicker, more yellow-colored discharge than normal.</p><p>To more definitively diagnose chlamydia in your cat, the vet may also send these swabs out to a lab for a specialized test called a Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). This test amplifies the bacteria on the swab in order for the lab to identify it.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>If your cat is diagnosed with chlamydia, your veterinarian's first choice of treatment will be an oral antibiotic known as doxycycline. If your cat has any known allergy to doxycycline or to other tetracyclines, be sure to tell your veterinarian so they can prescribe a different antibiotic.</p><p>If your cat is in noticeable discomfort-or if the symptoms seem severe enough-your veterinarian may also prescribe a topical eye ointment or drops to give in conjunction with the oral antibiotics. Oral antibiotics are more effective at fighting this type of infection. Topical treatments should always be used with your veterinarian's instructions, most often alongside an oral medication.</p><p>Medications for feline chlamydia should be used for a minimum of four weeks, plus an additional 10 days until all symptoms have completely cleared. All cats within the household should be treated at the same time, as some cats may have delayed symptoms or be asymptomatic but still contagious.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Chlamydia</h2><p>Some cats may experience more severe symptoms than others, but most cats that become infected with feline chlamydia can recover fully with proper care and treatment. However, without treatment, this disease can lead to severe respiratory infections. Kittens and young cats that become infected with feline chlamydia can develop life-threatening cases of pneumonia when the infection spreads to the lungs. For this reason, it's especially important for owners and caregivers to treat cats consistently under a veterinarian's supervision.</p><h2>How to Prevent Chlamydia</h2><p>There are a few different methods of prevention that owners and caregivers can use to protect their cats from feline chlamydia.</p><h3>Vaccines</h3><p>There is a vaccine available for feline chlamydia. However, its protection is not permanent: Owners will likely need to schedule follow-up vaccines annually for cats that are considered at-risk. If your cat lives alone in your home, this vaccine is usually not necessary unless the cat has a history of contracting chlamydia. Your veterinarian can help you determine your specific cat's risk level.</p><h3>Limiting Exposures</h3><p>If you have multiple cats living in the same household, it's important to limit exposures (and therefore, risk) to the best of your ability. Keep your cats indoors. Cats that spend time outside-even if only for a few minutes a day-may come into contact with other infected cats in your area. Some regions may have a higher volume of feline chlamydia cases than others.</p><h2>Is Feline Chlamydia Contagious to Humans?</h2><p>The bacteria is highly adapted to infecting cats, so the risk of humans contracting chlamydia from their cats is low. However, if one of your cats has been diagnosed with this disease or is suspected to have it, you should practice good hygiene and sanitization procedures after handling the cat until the infection is fully cleared.</p>",1126
161,https://www.thesprucepets.com/feline-infectious-peritonitis-in-cats-3384880,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP) in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a complicated viral disease of cats that is seen worldwide. The disease can affect the immune system and organs. Cats can be infected with the virus without any symptoms or problems and few will develop the disease and become fatally ill. There are two forms of the disease with symptoms that often overlap and they are equally tricky to diagnose.</p><h2>What Is FIP?</h2><p>FIP is a complex disease that is a result of infection with the feline coronavirus. While large numbers of cats are infected with feline coronavirus, few will ever develop FIP. The fatal disease is thought to result from a mutation of the virus within the body that combines with an incorrect response of the immune system. This combination leads to inflammation in various organ systems.</p><h2>Symptoms of FIP in Cats</h2><p>The two main categories of FIP, the wet form and the dry form, have different characteristics. These broad forms are not necessarily completely distinct and some cats will have some of both.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Distention of Abdomen</h3><p>If a cat has the wet form of FIP, it will have fluid build-up in its abdomen and chest area. Fluid may become concentrated directly around the heart, as well.</p><h3>Difficulty Breathing</h3><p>If a cat has wet form FIP, it will have difficulty breathing as the lungs are inflamed.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p>A cat with FIP may have a minor long-term fever that is unresponsive to treatment. Fevers are often vague symptoms that can accompany many other problems in cats.</p><h3>Loss of appetite and weight loss</h3><p>A cat with FIP may or may not lose its appetite or lose weight. In some cases, it's noted that a cat's appetite and weight may slightly increase if it has FIP.</p><h3>Depression</h3><p>A cat with FIP may or may not seem depressed and listless. However, if it has nervous system problems, the cat's personality and behaviors may change.</p><h3>Organ Failure</h3><p>Cats with the dry form of FIP are usually seen with inflamed cells invading various organs, such as the kidneys, liver, pancreas, or spleen. As a result, jaundice may become apparent as the disease progresses.</p><h3>Eye Problems</h3><p>Inflamed eyes may show signs of pus accumulation or tinges of blood, leading to possible blindness.</p><h3>Poor Muscle Coordination</h3><p>A cat's nervous system will show signs of distress if it has FIP. It will begin to lose muscle coordination resulting in minor limb paralysis. This can further lead to seizures and tremors.</p><h2>Causes of FIP</h2><p>FIP is most often seen in young cats less than 12 months old, but it can be seen at any age. It's still unknown why some cats develop FIP while others do not. Most cats that develop FIP have been recently exposed to some sort of stressful experience such as boarding, rehoming, or surgery.</p><p>The common coronavirus is spread through direct contact via the nose and mouth with infected feces, usually while sharing litter boxes. It is thought that a mutation in the virus directly affects cells and leads to FIP which causes a poor immune response in cats with immature or weakened immune systems. In addition, it appears that purebred cats, such as Abyssinian, Bengal, Birman, Himalayan, Persian, ragdoll, and all types of rex breeds, are prone to developing the disease.</p><h2>Diagnosing FIP in Cats</h2><p>Confirming a diagnosis of FIP can be very difficult. The best method to confirm a diagnosis of FIP requires a veterinarian to take a biopsy. The tissue samples from the biopsy are examined microscopically and often include special tests to mark the presence of the virus in tissue samples. If these tests are not possible, the diagnosis must be made on a combination of other factors, including clinical signs and laboratory tests which can include blood tests and analysis of fluid sampled from the abdomen if the wet form is present.</p><p>Testing for antibodies to coronavirus is not helpful in the diagnosis of FIP but is useful in screening healthy cats before introducing them to a coronavirus-free cat or group. A positive result only indicates exposure to coronavirus and possible shedding of coronavirus but does not mean a cat has or will develop FIP.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>There is no treatment for FIP. Some supportive measures, including draining excessive fluid build-ups, can provide temporary relief. A variety of medications designed to reduce the abnormal immune response to the virus or reduce the ability of the virus to reproduce have been tried. They may provide some relief from the disease and prolong survival.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With FIP</h2><p>Most cats infected with the virus that causes FIP may never become ill. But the cats who do develop signs of FIP will always succumb to the disease. Generally, cats showing signs of the wet form succumb to FIP sooner (within days to weeks) than those with symptoms of the dry form (up to a few months), though survival for several months may be possible.</p><h2>How to Prevent FIP</h2><p>Preventing exposure to coronavirus is the best way to prevent FIP. This is very difficult to do as well over half of all cats in a single-cat or multi-cat household may be infected with the virus. A majority of those cats will remain healthy, however. FIP only develops in a very low percentage of cats who are infected with the coronavirus, so exposure does not automatically mean cats will get FIP.</p><p>There is a vaccine available, although its use is controversial. The vaccine is given in the nose and is designed to produce just a local response to prevent the virus from gaining access to the body. The efficacy of the vaccine is questionable and it must be given before natural exposure to coronavirus to be effective. Because FIP is uncommon in the general cat population, the need for routine use of FIP vaccines is generally not recommended, although it can sometimes be used in shelters where the risk is highest. Your vet can discuss the use of FIP vaccines for your cat.</p><h2>Is FIP Contagious to Other Animals?</h2><p>The benign feline coronavirus is contagious to other cats because felines shed the virus in the feces. Another cat can become infected with the benign feline coronavirus through oral contact with the infected feces. However, if the virus mutates in an infected cat leading to FIP, the animal may not shed the mutated virus because it becomes cell-associated (the cells become directly infected). This means that FIP is not technically contagious to animals.</p><p>With that said, housemates of a cat diagnosed with FIP may not have a greater risk of developing FIP unless they are litter mates that share a genetic predisposition. They have also likely been exposed to coronavirus already, so no special precautions are usually necessary. Your vet can provide further advice regarding home care.</p>",1098

This may lead to troublesome bowel movements, including straining and discomfort. For cats, owners may notice fewer stools being passed or even no stool at all. If passed, the stool may be very hard and dry.</p><p>The colon is the main area in the gastrointestinal tract for water to be absorbed. When feces are kept in the colon for an extended period of time, the retained feces become firm and dried out. This, in turn, leads to difficulty passing the stool and discomfort.</p><p>This last sign may be confusing to cat owners. A constipated cat may strain so hard that a small amount of liquid feces or blood may be passed and mistaken for diarrhea. However, this liquid is actually passing around the hard stool, and the cat is constipated.</p><h2>Causes of Constipation in Cats</h2><p>Constipation may occur regardless of the cat 's age and health status. Cats are notoriously poor drinkers and, especially when fed a dry kibble diet, they are at higher risk of developing constipation. Any condition that leads to dehydration can also lead to constipation. Being sedentary and overweight are also risk factors. There is a very serious condition that can occur in overweight, middle-aged cats, called megacolon.</p><h3>Megacolon in cats</h3><p>Megacolon in cats is the result of serious constipation in cats. It is seen most often in middle-aged male cats that tend to be overweight.</p><p>In these cats, the colon loses appropriate nerve function and this results in a stretched-out and weak colon. Because the colon is dilated and much large than normal, feces may back up in the cat to truly astounding proportions. Adding to the issue, the colon lacks the ability to successfully push the feces out.</p><p>Megacolon is often diagnosed as a primary condition but may also occur secondary to long-standing and untreated normal constipation. This occurs because the colon becomes distended and weak due to large amounts of feces being trapped inside it over time. This stretching damages both the nerves and muscles of the colon, which affects its ability to contract.</p><p>The possibility of chronic constipation turning into megacolon is a serious concern and all constipated cats should be treated aggressively and in a timely manner.<br /><br /></p><h2>Diagnosing Constipation in Cats</h2><p>Any cat suspected of being constipated should see its veterinarian as soon as possible. The veterinarian will take a thorough history of what has been happening at home and do a complete physical exam.</p><p>A constipated cat will often have an enlarged colon full of hard fecal matter that the veterinarian can palpate. This may not be possible in overweight cats, so a quick and non-invasive x-ray will show the extent of the constipation and how dilated the cat 's colon may be.</p><p>X-rays will also be used to try to identify any physical causes of the constipation such as a foreign body obstruction, pelvic or sacral injuries, spinal issues, or tumors. In some cases, a more detailed look with an abdominal ultrasound may be necessary.</p><h2>Treatment for Constipation in Cats</h2><p>After the cause of the constipation is found, a treatment plan will be formulated with your veterinarian. Typically, constipated cats will require enemas and intravenous fluids. Miralax or another laxative may be added to help soften the feces enough to allow the cat to pass them.</p><p>If laxatives, enemas, and rehydration with fluid therapy do not enable the cat to defecate, manual extraction of the hardened feces by a veterinarian may be required. This procedure is performed under general anesthesia.</p><p>If a cat 's constipation recurs or becomes a long-term problem, dietary management or medications may be needed to prevent a recurrence. There are prescription diets, both in kibble and canned form, that may aid the cat in passing softer stool. Oral laxatives may also be administered at home and may work to soften the stool and encourage the cat to defecate.</p><p>In cats with severe cases of megacolon, your veterinarian may prescribe pro-motility agents to aid the cat 's colon in contracting and propelling feces out of the rectum. It is essential to keep up with your cat 's bowel movements to avoid more serious complications. Encouraging the cat to drink as much as possible or adding water to its food may also help ease its constipation issues.</p><p>Some cats may become constipated if their litter box is left dirty, and they do not feel comfortable defecating in it. Other cats in the house that may be guarding the litter box or attacking the constipated cat while they are in the box can also be an issue. It is important to have one litter box per cat plus an additional in your home. This will ensure there is always a litter box for your cat to use so that it will not willfully abstain from defecating.</p><p>If your cat has long hair and frequent hairballs that are contributing to its constipation, there are diets and supplements that can help the hair pass more easily through the gastrointestinal tract. Frequent brushing to remove as much of the hair as possible, before the cat can ingest it via grooming, can help tremendously to reduce hairballs.</p><h2>Prognosis for Constipation in Cats</h2><p>The majority of constipated cats respond to fluids, enemas, and medication or manual removal of stool. Surgery as a treatment for constipation in cats is rare but possibly necessary. Tumors or foreign bodies may need to be removed from the colon surgically. Also, in cases of megacolon that are refractory to traditional treatments, surgery may be recommended.</p><p>Surgical correction of severe and refractory megacolon involves removal of the affected portion of the colon, in a procedure called a partial or subtotal colectomy. Cats may have chronic diarrhea or fecal incontinence after this surgery, but the overall prognosis is good.</p><p>Constipation in cats is common and, in most cases, is easily treated. You should pay attention and learn the normal frequency of defecation for your cat to enable you to notice if there is an issue.</p><p>Typically, most cats will have a bowel movement every day to every other day. If you notice your cat is suddenly not defecating normally or is straining in the litter box, you should make an appointment with its veterinarian right away. Prompt treatment of constipation in cats can avoid future more serious complications.</p>",1052
163,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lyme-disease-in-cats-3384715,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Lyme Disease in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Lyme Disease in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Lyme disease and the bacteria that causes it can be transmitted to cats through ticks though the illness is very rarely seen in felines. Cats do not always develop symptoms like dogs and humans, so diagnosis can be tricky. Lyme disease can lead to fever, lethargy, and a poor appetite but the right treatment can make your cat feel better in a short amount of time.</p><h2>What Is Lyme Disease?</h2><p>Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness that affects a variety of species and is commonly seen in humans and dogs. It has been shown that cats can become infected with bacteria (the causative agent of Lyme disease), but many cats do not show signs of the disease. Nevertheless, it is a diagnosis to consider when cats have symptoms compatible with Lyme disease, especially in areas where Lyme disease is common, such as New England, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Delaware, and even Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.</p><p>Cats and dogs can become infected with without ever developing symptoms of Lyme disease. Where Lyme disease is common, cats may test positive for exposure to the bacteria despite not showing any signs of the disease.</p><h2>Symptoms of Lyme Disease in Cats</h2><p>If a cat develops Lyme disease, the symptoms are similar to dogs and humans though not as severe, and they begin to appear within a few weeks after infection. If your cat develops these symptoms during the warm weather season when ticks are active, see your vet. It is important to note, however, that many other tick-borne diseases are prevalent in the northeastern portion of the United States that can affect cats. One illness, called anaplasmosis, occurs in cats and leads to fever, lethargy, and a poor appetite. It is also treated with antibiotics.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Limping</h3><p>Because Lyme disease affects the joints and muscles, your cat may begin limping. The limping may shift from leg to leg as the cat tries to manage the discomfort. The limbs may begin to feel better, then pain recurs at a later date.</p><h3>Stiffness and Pain</h3><p>The infected cat may experience painful stiffness and pain around the joints and muscles. The limb joints may also be swollen.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p>A fever in a cat can indicate a number of maladies, including Lyme disease. Though it's best to let your vet take your cat's temperature with a thermometer, you can watch for fever symptoms, such as listlessness, shivering, or an increased breathing or heart rate. If the symptoms of a fever have not diminished, call your vet immediately.</p><h3>Lethargy and Decreased Appetite</h3><p>A cat with Lyme disease may act listless and lose its appetite. The bacteria could be affecting its heart, as well, which could cause extreme exhaustion.</p><h3>Secondary Kidney Disease</h3><p>If the Lyme is left untreated, a cat may experience kidney disease as the bacteria travels throughout the bloodstream. The kidney problems will lead to increased thirst, urination, and vomiting. The Lyme disease may be causing inflammation of the kidney which negatively affects the way it filters the cat's blood and toxins.</p><h2>Causes of Lyme Disease</h2><p>Ticks become infected with the , bacteria by feeding on infected mice and other small animals. When an infected tick bites other animals, it can transmit the bacteria to these animals. Lyme disease is transmitted by the deer tick (also called or the black-legged tick) and a group of other closely related ticks. The exact tick species varies by location, but the deer tick is small enough to bite animals and people without being easily detected.</p><p>Cats that spend a lot of time outdoors, especially in areas with bush or tall grass, are most at risk of being infected with Lyme disease bacteria. It is important to remember that ticks can be carried into yards on other animals, so even cats that don't roam far could potentially be bitten by a tick. Ticks are frequently found on dogs, so if you have a one, the tick can hitch a ride into the home on it and then bite an indoor pet cat. There is currently no evidence that Lyme disease is spread by direct contact between animals, including between infected pets and their owners.</p><h2>Diagnosing Lyme Disease in Cats</h2><p>Because so few cats develop symptoms after infection with , a diagnosis of Lyme disease must be made on a combination of factors. An antibody test is not enough to make a diagnosis on its own because not all cats that are exposed to get sick, and the antibodies can persist in the blood for a period of time after exposure.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>In dogs with Lyme disease, treatment with antibiotics usually produces a rapid improvement in symptoms and the same should hold true for cats. If there are more serious issues that might be secondary to Lyme disease, such as kidney disease, a longer course of antibiotics along with additional treatments is usually necessary. Your vet will come up with a treatment plan that is aligned with your cat's needs and medical situation.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Lyme Disease</h2><p>The prognosis for cats with Lyme disease is good. If the cat is treated in a timely manner, a full recovery should be fast. Delayed treatment can still lead to a good outcome, but it will take longer to achieve, and some tissue or joints may become irreversibly damaged and remain painful</p>",870
164,https://www.thesprucepets.com/ear-infections-in-cats-3384627,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Ear Infections in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Ear Infections in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Ear infections are common among cats, and they can be tricky to treat because they have numerous causes. Cats' ears can be invaded by various parasites, irritated by allergies, or plagued by polyps. A veterinary diagnosis is crucial in determining a targeted treatment plan. Left untreated, ear infections can lead to hearing loss or more serious systemic infections. If you notice your cat scratching an ear or tilting its head, schedule a vet visit to investigate.</p><h2>What Is an Ear Infection?</h2><p>An ear infection is a bacterial or fungal overgrowth in a cat's ear canal. While there are numerous causes of infection, the root problem is an imbalance in the ear's natural flora. Excess moisture may accumulate due to structural abnormalities or foreign objects; while allergies or ear mites can cause irritation and the build-up of waxy debris. Whatever the trigger, the result is an infection that requires treatment to eliminate the specific cause and restore a healthy balance in the ear.</p><h2>Symptoms of Ear Infection in Cats</h2><p>Regardless of the cause of the ear infection, the signs of an ear problem usually look similar.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3> <p>Head shaking, tilting, and scratching are indicative of an ear infection, which may be present in one or both ears. The infection causes extreme itching and irritation. Unpleasant smells and discharge are more common once the infection has been active for over a week, and scabs from scratching will eventually become obvious in the absence of treatment. If ear mites are present, then a dark, waxy build-up will be apparent. Rarely do any of the other observable symptoms point to the cause of infection, which must be determined by a veterinarian.</p><h2>Ear Mites</h2><p>Ear mites are responsible for a majority of the ear infections seen in cats. These parasites will be one of the first things your veterinarian checks for if your cat has an ear infection. The irritating presence of these tiny bugs inflames a cat's ears and causes excess wax production, prompting the cat to scratch and create open sores. The resulting ear environment is susceptible to bacterial overgrowth and infection.</p><p>Ear mites cause a characteristic dark brown to black discharge in the ears that looks a bit like coffee grounds. The presence of this discharge is often the first indication that your cat has ear mites. Your veterinarian may also examine the debris from your cat's ears under a microscope to find evidence of ear mites. Once identified, mites can be treated with miticide ear drops, or a systemic pest control medication will be prescribed to treat the problem. If a secondary bacterial infection has developed, then antibiotics may be prescribed as well.</p><h2>Causes</h2><p>External or environmental factors cause most ear infections in cats, triggering inflammation and throwing off the balance of the ear so that bacteria or fungi can thrive. In some cases, small polyps may grow in a cat's ear which also set the stage for infection due to blockage and moisture accumulation.</p><h2>Diagnosing Ear Infections in Cats</h2><p>The diagnosis starts with an examination of the ears. Your veterinarian will perform an examination of your cat's ears with an otoscope, which illuminates and magnifies the inside of the ear canal. Your vet will look for signs such as redness and inflammation, discharge, polyps, foreign bodies, or any other abnormalities.</p><p>Depending on the severity of the infection, sedation may be necessary to thoroughly flush the ear canal and conduct a thorough examination.</p><p>Ear cytology is sometimes necessary if a cause can't readily be identified. This involves swabbing the inside of your cat's ear and then using a microscope to look for abnormal cells, bacteria, or yeast. The results of this test will help your veterinarian determine which antibiotics or other medications are best used in your cat's ears.</p><p>An ear culture may be performed, particularly if ear cytology indicates a bacterial infection that is not responding well to antibiotic treatment. An ear culture will tell your veterinarian what type of bacteria is present in your cat's ears and test specific antibiotics to determine if they are effective in killing that bacteria.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Since there are many different causes of feline ear infections, there is no single treatment that will work for every situation. In some instances, antibiotics or antifungals may be warranted. In others, simply cleaning and flushing the ear canal may be sufficient. Ear mites require a specific pesticide, while polyps may need to be surgically removed. Dietary changes to eliminate allergenic food items are a longer-term ""test"" treatment to see if the cat's infection clears up completely, and you will probably need to treat the ears topically during this time to ease inflammation and allow healing of the tissues.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats with Ear Infections</h2><p>Cats usually respond well to treatment for ear infections and recover within a few weeks. Ear mites may require multiple treatments of miticide to fully eradicate the problem, but persistence will pay off. Polyps require more invasive treatment, so the cat's recovery will depend on the severity of the problem and the health of its immune system.</p><h2>Prevention</h2><p>While it's not possible to prevent your cat from ever getting an ear infection, you may be able to prevent an infection from becoming serious by being alert to the symptoms. Healthy cat ears are light pink, free of wax and other debris, and don't have an unpleasant odor. A change in the color or smell of its ears may indicate that your cat has an infection brewing. Cats' ears should not be flushed regularly in an attempt to keep them clean; doing so may alter the ears' natural bacterial balance and make them more susceptible to infection.</p>",927
165,https://www.thesprucepets.com/my-kitten-swallowed-a-string-3384921,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>What to Do If Your Cat Has Swallowed a String</h1>,"<h1>What to Do If Your Cat Has Swallowed a String</h1> <p>Cats are curious naturally and love to investigate new sights, smells, and tastes. Sometimes, this curiously can lead them into trouble. Both kittens and adult cats also love to play with string, yarn, and the like. But this brings with it the risk that your cat will eat the string, which can lead to serious complications in some cases. As a cat caregiver, you need to be aware of the dangers of string ingestion and the signs that the string is still in your cat's gastrointestinal tract.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Swallow String?</h2><p>Cats are amazing, intelligent creatures. Their lifestyle reflects the predatory skills and behaviors needed to hunt food in the wild. A cat 's day includes the need to rest, stalk, chase, pounce, kill, play, eat, and groom among other things. Hunting is an innate behavior in cats meaning it 's an instinct and normal behavior for all cats. String and string like items move very similar in the way it twists and curls in the cats grasp to the prey cats hunt and at the end of the hunt cats eat so this can cause some cats to chew and ingest these items. Also, cat play is mostly mimicking the hunt prey cycle for your cat and some cats may love to chew on things and not have cat safe options to chew.</p><h2>What Happens When Cats Swallow String?</h2><p>It is best to keep strings and string like items away from your cat and if playing with a toy with string, it should be used with supervision to help prevent your cat from ingesting it.</p><p>There are various severe complications that can happen if your cat swallows a string with the most common issues being a foreign body obstruction. The term foreign body refers to any non-food object located with the digestive tract of a dog or cat. When this is a long, thin, string, type object, it is referred to as a linear foreign body.</p><p>Although it would seem that linear foreign bodies should pass uneventfully, this is not always the case. The string can become wrapped around the base of the tongue or anchored in the stomach which can be a choking hazard, cause the cat to swallow the string, or if the string had a needle attached, the needle may pierce the stomach or intestines and more.</p><p>A gastrointestinal blockage meaning If one end of the linear foreign body becomes lodged at some point in the gastrointestinal tract, such as at the base of the tongue (an especially common location for linear foreign bodies in cats), in the stomach, or in the intestine, the free end of the foreign body will trail down the remainder of the gastrointestinal tract. Since the string is wrapped around the internal organs, the intestines will attempt to move this linear foreign body down the gastrointestinal tract for elimination but since the linear body is unable to move, this will result in the intestines to bunch up and narrow. This is an emergency and lead to painful swelling in the cats stomach and the cat will be unable to eat until the item is removed.</p><p>If the linear foreign body does not cause immediate blockage, it can also harm your cat by causing perforation of your cats ' internal organs. Think of a string rubbing these organs, this may cause the organs to perforate and puncture which will prevent the organs from working appropriately and lead to internal bleeding, another emergency.</p><h2>Symptoms of String Swallowing</h2><p>In many cases, caregivers are not aware their cat ingested a string but do notice the symptoms which is why it 's important to be aware of what they are and contact your veterinarian as soon as you notice your cat is not acting themselves. Early intervention is crucial and can make a life-or-death difference for your cat. </p><p>If there are no complications, your cat should pass the string in its feces in 10 to 24 hours. The problem is that it's often impossible to know how much your cat ingested and whether any remains in its digestive system.</p><p>Monitor and contact your veterinarian if you notice one or more of these symptoms in your cat, these symptoms can happen quickly or may be noticed more slowly over a few days after your cat ingesting the string. Typically, symptoms appear within one to two days. However, it's possible that a cat ate something weeks prior and showed only minor symptoms.</p><h2>What To Do If Your Cat Ate String?</h2><p>If you observed your cat playing with a string and chewing on it; then the string was gone. You should monitor your cat for any symptoms and contact your veterinarian.</p><p>If you see the string under your cat's tongue (extending down the throat) or protruding from the anus, it's important to never pull the string.</p><p>Always call your veterinarian for advice when you believe your cat has swallowed a linear foreign object. If you see the string around the tongue, take your cat to the vet so it can be removed safely.</p><p>You should also see your veterinarian if any of the more serious symptoms have developed. Even if you think the cat has passed all of the string in its feces, there may still be some in its stomach or gut that's causing problems.</p>",882
166,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pancreatitis-in-cats-4178003,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>Pancreatitis in Cats</h1>,"<h1>Pancreatitis in Cats</h1><h2>Causes, Treatment, and Prevention</h2><p>Pancreatitis refers to the painful inflammation of the pancreas (an organ near the stomach and liver that helps with digestion and blood sugar control). The exact cause of pancreatitis in cats is unknown, and the symptoms-abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea-mimic several other gastrointestinal problems. Pancreatitis can be life-threatening, so it's important to bring these symptoms to your veterinarian's attention for an accurate diagnosis and targeted treatment.</p><p>Chronic cases can be managed and may require a low-fat diet for life. Untreated, chronic pancreatitis can lead to other diseases like diabetes.</p><h2>What Is Pancreatitis?</h2><p>Pancreatitis is a condition in which the pancreas becomes inflamed. This inflammation causes pain and digestive issues in cats.</p><p>Pancreatitis can be either as acute or chronic. Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and is more often fatal than chronic pancreatitis, which reoccurs (generally in less severe episodes) over months or even years.</p><h2>Symptoms of Pancreatitis in Cats</h2><p>Pancreatitis can cause a variety of symptoms due to gastrointestinal disturbance affecting not only the pancreas but also nearby organs such as the stomach, gallbladder, liver, and intestines. Symptoms associated with pancreatitis are often the same as other digestive problems.</p><h3>Symptoms</h3><h3>Abdominal Pain</h3><p>If your cat has abdominal or belly pain from pancreatitis, it may cry out, hiss, or try to get away if you try to pick it up. Your cat may also seem to have difficulty getting comfortable when lying down. Your veterinarian can also feel your pet tense up if there is a sensitive or painful spot when feeling the belly.</p><h3>Vomiting and Diarrhea</h3><p>A cat may vomit for many reasons and pancreatitis is one of the more serious causes. Vomiting may occur due to abdominal pain or digestive issues that are secondary to the organ's inflammation.</p><p>Since pancreatitis affects the pancreas and the pancreas plays an important part in digestion, cats with pancreatitis often experience diarrhea.</p><h3>Weight Loss</h3><p>Cats with pancreatitis usually lose weight in response to the other symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia.</p><h3>Dehydration</h3><p>If a cat with pancreatitis is lethargic, it may not want to drink much water and also have diarrhea. The combination of these two things can quickly lead to dehydration. You can quickly tell if your cat is dehydrated by gently pulling up the skin between its shoulder blades. If it stays ""tented"" and does not snap back into place, your cat may be dehydrated.</p><h3>Fever</h3><p>If there is inflammation in the pancreas, a cat will often have an elevated core body temperature. Though it's best to let your vet take your cat's temperature with a thermometer, you can watch for signs of a fever. Signs of a fever can include lethargy, loss of appetite, dehydration, an elevated heart rate, and breathing that may resemble fast panting.</p><h3>Anorexia</h3><p>A cat that doesn't feel well due to abdominal pain and vomiting usually doesn't want to eat very much-or at all. If a cat does not eat for 24 hours, it faces additional health complications, so veterinary attention is needed as soon as possible if a cat refuses food.</p><h2>Causes of Pancreatitis</h2><p>Although pancreatitis in other species is fairly well understood, little is known about what causes this relatively rare condition in cats. In some cases, pancreatitis can be linked to a known toxoplasmosis infection in a cat, but most cases have no identifiable cause.</p><h2>Diagnosing Pancreatitis in Cats</h2><p>It can be difficult to diagnose a mild episode of pancreatitis in a cat. It is thought that many cats with chronic pancreatitis often go undiagnosed because of the transient nature of the symptoms.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>Veterinary treatment is needed if a cat has acute pancreatitis that is causing pain and uncontrollable vomiting and/or diarrhea.</p><p>Most cats will be hospitalized for several days while these treatments are administered. After a cat recovers from a pancreatic episode, your vet may recommend feeding a fat-restrictive diet to help prevent the recurrence of inflammation.</p><p>If your cat has chronic pancreatitis, flare-ups may be managed with a veterinarian's recommended protocol of symptomatic care, which could include giving anti-emetic or anti-diarrhea medications, liquefied food, or subcutaneous fluids to combat dehydration.</p><h2>Prognosis for Cats With Pancreatitis</h2><p>If an acute pancreatitis attack is severe enough, it can be deadly. Chronic pancreatitis flare-ups, unlike acute pancreatitis, are often more manageable. If your cat has previously been diagnosed with pancreatitis, watch for signs of future flares like decreased food intake or stomach upset.</p><p>If your cat starts vomiting or having diarrhea, then you should contact your vet immediately to avoid further complications, which may include diabetes mellitus and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (insufficient synthesis and secretion of digestive enzymes). Both of these diseases can be caused by uncontrolled chronic pancreatitis in cats due to the damage the pancreas incurs from inflammation.</p><h2>How to Prevent Pancreatitis</h2><p>Since the exact cause of pancreatitis in cats is still undetermined, there is no definitive way to prevent it. Your vet may suggest a specific diet or supplement that has been shown to support pancreatic health in cats or to keep your cat at an ideal body weight, which is critically important for avoiding many obesity-related conditions.</p>",819

As a cat owner, you'll need to occasionally handle your pet so you can give it medications, groom it, or check it over. Not all cats can tolerate handling. In fact, many cats get extremely stressed out if you try to handle them in any way. Fortunately, there is a technique you can use with a towel to swaddle your cat into a kind of cat ""burrito"" or, if you will, ""purrito.""</p><h2>What Is a Cat Burrito?</h2><p>The terms cat burrito and purrito refer to a towel-wrapping technique used to swaddle a cat for safe handling. It's a fairly easy way to restrain a cat while easing the stress and allows you to handle the cat without getting hurt.</p><h2>Reasons to Burrito a Cat</h2> <p>If you have trouble getting your cat wrapped, ask someone at your vet's office to show you how.</p><h2>Why Cat Burritos Help Some Cats</h2><p>Many cats become stressed and fearful when being handled and will exhibit an aggressive fight or flight response. This is especially common at the veterinarian's office, where cats may feel cornered and vulnerable. Most cats will try to run away and hide, fighting off whatever gets in their way. This can lead to injuries in both cats and humans.</p><p>Veterinarians and staff have tools and tricks that allow them to safely and humanely handle stressed cats. One of the simplest of these tools is a basic towel. A towel will not completely protect a person from bites and scratches, but it can minimize the damage a cat can do.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Do not attempt to handle a cat that is extremely stressed or angry because you and the cat may both be injured.</p><p>Give the cat a chance to calm down and try the handling another day or let the vet's office handle the restraint. Some cats will need to be sedated (put in a sleep-like state which differs from anesthesia) for safety reasons.</p><h2>How to Make a Cat Burrito</h2><p>All you need to burrito your cat is a towel. Choose a bath or beach towel that is not too thick or plush (thinner towels are easier to manipulate into a burrito). A larger beach towel is ideal, especially for large cats. Also, gather any tools you may need, such as medications and nail trimmers. The last thing you want is to carry around a cat in a burrito while looking for the supplies you need.</p><h3>Lay the Towel Flat</h3><p>Lay the towel flat on a solid surface like a floor, counter, or table. Make sure the towel is positioned horizontally to you.</p><h3>Pick Up the Cat</h3><p>Gently pick up your cat while speaking to it in a calm, soothing tone. Offer valuable treats if your cat is food-motivated.</p><h3>Place Cat in the Middle of the Towel</h3><p>Place the cat in the middle of the horizontal towel. It doesn't have to be perfect, even if you have your cat closer to one side, that's fine.</p><h3>Try to Get the Cat to Lie Down</h3><p>Gently place a hand on the back of its neck, then lay your forearm over its body (spine) and apply a gentle downward pressure to keep your pet still. If the cat will not lie down, don't force the issue. The cat may modify its position as you proceed to wrap it.</p><h3>Wrap One End Over Cat's Back</h3><p>Take a top corner of the towel near the cat's head and bring it over so it wraps around its back, leaving only the head exposed. Tuck the cat's tail to the side of its body so it stays inside the towel. Wrap the top corner of this side around the neck gently, making sure the paws are inside the towel.</p><h3>Switch Hands</h3><p>Switch hands and maintain gentle pressure on the cat's back.</p><h3>Wrap Other End of Towel</h3><p>Take the other top corner of the towel and wrap that end firmly over the cat's back.</p><h3>Lift the Cat and Wrap Remaining Towel</h3><p>Gently lift the cat and wrap any remaining towel under the cat's body. Offer your cat a treat at this point so it can associate towels with pleasurable treats.</p><h3>Brace the Wrapped Cat Against Your Body</h3><p>Use one arm to brace the wrapped cat against your body while you give medications, clean ears, or do anything else needed to your cat's head. Do not let go or the cat will escape the towel wrap.</p><h3>Repeat Wrapping Process for Nail Trims and Paw Handling</h3><p>For nail trims or paw handling, repeat the wrapping process but leave one or both paws out of the towel. If you need to access the tail or rear end, leave this part exposed.</p>",779

Besides household chemicals, common foods, houseplants, and even the contents of your sewing box may all be something your cat tries to eat at some point. While some human food and houseplants are safe for cats to nibble on, many can be toxic. Knowing how to make your cat vomit up what they ate as well as when to make them vomit can be a key tactic in at-home first aid.</p><h2>At-Home Methods</h2><p>A common method to make your dog vomit is to administer 3 percent hydrogen peroxide orally at a dosage of about 1 tsp per five to 10 pounds of body weight, but is peroxide safe for cats? The use of hydrogen peroxide in cats is no longer recommended since it is rarely effective and can instead induce severe, life-threatening ulceration of the stomach.</p><p>Other sources may recommend giving your cat a solution of salt water. This has it's own pitfalls, though. Giving a large amount of salt at once can be toxic by itself. Also, renal (kidney) dysfunction is a common disease process seen in cats, especially elderly ones. Additionally, some toxic items including lily plants, antifreeze, and NSAIDs (like ibuprofen or aspirin) can cause acute renal failure. Part of the job of the kidneys is to filter out the salt in your cat's bloodstream, so adding to that by way of salt water may exacerbate an underlying issue.</p><h2>Veterinary Methods</h2><p>Truly, the safest way to make your cat vomit is to have your vet do it. There are injectable medications that your vet can give your cat to induce vomiting, including dexmedetomidine, hydromorphone, and xylazine. It should be noted that this is a different medication than the one your vet will give your dog to induce vomiting.</p><p>Ideally, your cat should start vomiting within a few minutes of receiving the injection, but cats are not as consistent as dogs about vomiting at the vet's office. Only about 60-75% of cats will vomit with medication. Once it is clear there is nothing more that your cat can bring up, there are other medications your vet can give that will help with the nausea from hydromorphone or the sedation from xylazine or dexmedetomidine. Veterinarians tend to induce vomiting far less frequently in cats than in dogs, though, so ask them if they have this medication in the hospital in case of an emergency so that you can plan ahead.</p><h2>When to Induce Vomiting</h2><p>If you suspect your cat has gotten into something they shouldn't have, making them vomit might actually might cause more harm than good. There are certain instances when making your cat is not recommended. If it has been more than two or three hours since you suspect your cat ate a toxin, making them vomit is less likely to be successful since the object may have been absorbed or already moved past the stomach.</p><p>If your cat has ingest caustic materials, such as bleach, drain cleaner, or petroleum based products you should not make them vomit it back up. By doing so you could cause chemical burns on your cat's esophagus and could even cause your cat to breathe in (or aspirate) the caustic materials. If you suspect your cat at a sewing needle or sewing thread, you also do not want to make them throw up. The needle could puncture the esophagus or mouth on the way back up. Sewing thread has a nasty habit of getting partly stuck in a cat's intestines, allowing the rest of the thread to cut through the rest of the intestines. If you suspect your cat ate thread, making them vomit could potentially cause the thread to cut through your cat's esophagus.</p><p>Other times you should not induce vomiting in your cat include if they are already vomiting, if they are weak or unconscious, if your cat has a history of seizures or other neurological conditions, if your cat has a heart condition, or if your cat has had recent abdominal surgery.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Cats with shorter snouts (such as Persians) should also not be made to vomit as there is an increased risk for aspiration (breathing in) of the stomach contents. If your cat aspirates on her vomit, she can come down with something called aspiration pneumonia.</p><p>By and large, dogs definitely are the main offender when it comes to getting into toxins and things they shouldn't be, but that doesn't mean cats don't get into their fair share of mischief either. If you suspect your cat has gotten into something that can harm them, contact your vet immediately. They can advise you on what steps you should take and can make your cat safely vomit if that is the best course of action.</p>",786
169,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-treat-hyperthyroidism-in-cats-5212827,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>How to Treat Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h1>,"<h1>How to Treat Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h1><p>No one wants their cat to get sick but some illnesses can be easily managed with proper treatment. Hyperthyroidism is one such disease and is fairly common in older cats. By knowing the common symptoms of this disease, you can get your cat the veterinary attention that is needed to treat and manage it before other serious problems develop.</p><h2>What Is Hyperthyroidism?</h2><p>Hyperthyroidism, the opposite of hypothyroidism, is also known as thyrotoxicosis and occurs when the thyroid gland becomes enlarged and produces extra hormones. The thyroid gland is located in the neck and makes hormones called T3 and T4, which play a role in a variety of bodily functions, including metabolism and body temperature regulation. When a cat develops hyperthyroidism, too much T3 and T4 are produced causing a cat to become increasingly sick over time.</p><h2>Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h2><h3>Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h3><p>The classic signs of hyperthyroidism are excessive appetite coupled with weight loss. Some cat owners say their cat seems to eat anything that isn't nailed down but somehow doesn't gain any weight. Instead, hyperthyroid cats lose weight and may also begin to drink and urinate more. Other common symptoms include vomiting, matted unkempt fur, and behavior changes like aggression and hyperactivity.</p><h2>Causes of Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h2><p>There are two types of tumors that cause hyperthyroidism in cats. Most cases of hyperthyroidism are due to a benign tumor called an adenoma but in rare cases, a cancerous tumor called an adenocarcinoma is the cause. Both tumors cause the thyroid gland to become enlarged but no one knows what causes either type of tumor to grow to begin with.</p><h2>Diagnosing Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h2><p>If your cat is showing symptoms of hyperthyroidism, a visit to their veterinarian is warranted. The vet will perform a physical examination and obtain your cat's history before recommending blood screening be performed. Sometimes, enlarged thyroid glands can be detected during the physical exam. The blood screening will look at how well your cat's organs are functioning as well as measure how much thyroid hormone is being produced by your cat's thyroid glands. If these hormone levels are high, your cat will be diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Other tests may be recommended as well to look for common complications seen with hyperthyroidism, like high blood pressure.</p><h2>Treatment of Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h2><p>There are four ways to treat a cat that has been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism: dietary treatment, surgery, medication, and radioactive iodine therapy. Each option has its pros and cons and may not be right for every cat but the majority of cat owners opt to treat the disease with either diet or medication. Medications reduce the amount of thyroid hormones that the thyroid glands produce and the special diet restricts the amount of iodine a cat consumes. Iodine is essential for thyroid hormone production, so limiting iodine intake limits thyroid hormone production.</p><p>Radioactive iodine is often recommended as the ideal treatment option, if your cat is a candidate, and destroys the abnormal thyroid tissue. This procedure is not performed by every vet and can be costly but typically cures the disease so no further treatment is necessary. Surgery can also cure the disease but is more invasive than the other three options so it is not as commonly recommended.</p><h2>How to Prevent Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h2><p>Because no one knows what causes a cat to develop the tumors that cause hyperthyroidism, there is no way to prevent the disease. The best thing you can do as a cat owner is to address any symptoms of hyperthyroidism as soon as you see them. Additionally, treating the disease promptly upon diagnosis will help prevent other problems from developing. Regular check-ups and blood screenings for your older cat can help find a problem before it becomes serious so your veterinarian plays an important role in the long-term health of your cat.</p><h2>Risk Factors for Hyperthyroidism in Cats</h2><p>While no specific cat breed has a definitively higher risk for developing hyperthyroidism than another, any cat senior is at a greater risk for the disease. Some studies suggest that cats that eat mostly canned food, especially fish-based canned food, are at increased risk. One study showed that longhaired, non-purebred cats have a higher risk of developing the disease while Siamese, Burmese, Tonkinese, Persians, Abyssinians, and British shorthairs have a decreased risk when compared to domestic shorthairs.</p>",716

It's called , and it's the larva of a botfly. Cats, dogs, ferrets, and even humans can be affected by botfly larva. Removing the unwelcome larva is the key to treating this relatively common condition.</p><h2>What is Cuterebra?</h2><p>is the scientific name for a type of botfly that causes a parasitic infection called cuterebriasis. Cuterebriasis occurs in cats when the larva of the fly enters the cat's body. lesions are sometimes called ""warbles.""</p><p>are large flies that lay their eggs near the nests and burrows of small mammals like rodents and rabbits. When a host animal walks by, the eggs can become attached and hatch in response to the animal's body heat. The newly hatched larvae typically enter the animal's body via the mouth or nose during grooming or through open wounds on the skin. The larvae migrate and incubate in the host's body, getting oxygen through a small, round breathing pore on the skin. After about 30 days, the larvae mature and fall off the host to pupate in the soil until they develop into adult flies.</p><p>Cats are not ideal hosts for , but may become inadvertently infected after coming into contact with botfly eggs. Lesions typically occur near the head and neck but can appear anywhere on the body. larvae look like short, fat worms that are usually up to an inch long. They are typically gray or beige in color.</p><h2>Signs of Cuterebra in Cats</h2><h3>Signs of Cuterebra in Cats</h3><p>lesions typically appear as a swollen area under the skin with a small hole in the center. Lesions are often seen near the head or neck but they can be found anywhere on the cat's body. They are generally non-painful unless they invade sensitive tissues. However, the swelling but may be bothersome to the cat and cause increased grooming. Owners may discover matted hair over the larva's breathing hole.</p><p>In rare but serious cases, larvae can migrate to the delicate tissues of the nasal cavities, head, brain, eyelids, and pharynx. Cerebrospinal cuterebriasis occurs when a lesion affects the central nervous system, leading to neurological problems like seizures, circling, unusual behavior, and blindness. It is believed that infections can cause a neurological condition called feline ischemic encephalopathy.</p><p>lesions are generally not visible until the larva becomes large enough to cause a lump or swelling. In some cases, the larva will mature and leave the cat's body before it is ever seen. A bacterial infection can occur in the remaining skin lesion and lead to an abscess.</p><p>Contact your veterinarian if you notice swelling anywhere on your cat's body. Treatment may be needed even if the larva has left the cat.</p><h2>Causes of Cuterebra in Cats</h2><p>Cats are considered ""accidental"" hosts of . They most often come into contact with botfly eggs while outdoors hunting and exploring the burrows of small wild animals. Therefore, outdoor cats are far more likely to develop cuterebriasis than indoor cats.</p><p>is commonly found all over the Americas. In North America, infestations occur most commonly in the summer and fall.</p><p>Humans cannot get infections from their cats, but it is possible to develop a lesion after coming into direct contact with botfly eggs.</p><h2>Treatment</h2><p>lesions are treated by first removing the fly larva from the body, if present. Your veterinarian may recommend sedation for your cat in order to remove the larva and clean the wound properly.</p><p>Larva removal is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky. The larva should be removed in one piece to avoid contamination. The veterinarian will enlarge the breathing hole, then grasp the larva with forceps. It can be easier to use petroleum jelly to block the air hole before removing the larva.</p><p>After the larva has been completely removed, the remaining wound is cleaned and flushed out. Unhealthy tissue is debrided (cut away) to promote healing. The affected cat may need treatment with antibiotics. Pain medication and anti-inflammatory drugs may be prescribed to provide comfort if the wound is very irritated.</p><p>Recovery is typically fast as long as the cat is unable to groom the affected area during healing. Your cat may need to wear an e-collar (the ""cone of shame"") until the wound has healed.</p><h2>How to Prevent Cuterebra in Cats</h2><p>The best way to protect cats from infections is to keep them indoors at all times. Outdoor cats often hunt small mammals and may come into contact with larvae. If your cat does go outdoors, check him regularly for signs of swelling. Contact your vet if you notice anything abnormal.</p>",778
171,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-to-treat-feline-leukemia-5213536,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Cat Treatments,<h1>How to Treat Feline Leukemia</h1>,"<h1>How to Treat Feline Leukemia</h1><p>Any cat can contract feline leukemia by being exposed to the virus that causes it. It is easily spread from cat to cat, but is also easily preventable. This viral infection is a serious, incurable disease. Cat owners, however, can take steps to prevent their cat from being infected.</p><h2>What Is Feline Leukemia?</h2><p>Feline leukemia is a very common disease in domestic cats with about 3% of all cats in the United States being infected. This disease is caused by the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) that can easily be transmitted to cats that are exposed to infected cats. Feline leukemia leaves infected cats at risk of developing cancer, anemia and infections because of a weakened immune system. There is unfortunately no cure for this viral infection.</p><h2>Symptoms of Feline Leukemia</h2><p>Feline leukemia is not easily recognizable by symptoms alone since there are so many possible signs of the disease. Cats that have been infected with the feline leukemia virus may exhibit a variety of symptoms including weight loss, lack of appetite, and persistent diarrhea. Because of how the virus affects the bone marrow, some cats may also develop weakness, pale mucous membranes, or bruising. Other common symptoms of feline leukemia include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, stomatitis, and neurological signs including seizures and behavior changes. Not all infected cats show symptoms right away.</p><h2>Causes of Feline Leukemia</h2><p>Feline leukemia is caused by the feline leukemia virus. This virus is shed in infected cats through their saliva, urine, feces, and if they are lactating, their milk, too. This means that if an infected cat bites or even grooms another cat, it can spread this virus. Sometimes it can even be spread through shared litterboxes and food and water dishes but it does not survive very long in the environment once it leaves the infected cat. Additionally, infected cats that are pregnant or nursing will pass the virus on to their offspring.</p><h2>Diagnosing Feline Leukemia</h2><p>Because cats infected with feline leukemia can exhibit a variety of symptoms, your veterinarian may recommend testing for the virus if your cat is sick. A small blood sample will be obtained and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) will be used to detect the virus in your cat's blood. This test is routinely performed in healthy kittens as a screening tool but is also used if your cat is exhibiting symptoms. A secondary assay called an indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) is often performed if the ELISA is positive to rule out a potential false positive result. The IFA is more sensitive to advanced disease and will confirm the diagnosis of feline leukemia if it is also positive.</p><h2>Treatment of Feline Leukemia</h2><p>Feline leukemia is unfortunately not curable. Infected cats may require symptomatic treatment with medications and IV fluids but there is not long term treatment for the disease itself. Some cats may benefit from immune support supplements like beta-glucan found in Imuquin and other cat products or various antiviral drugs but any treatment should be discussed with your veterinarian to avoid any potential negative side effects.</p><h2>How to Prevent Feline Leukemia</h2><p>Despite not having a treatment option for cats infected with feline leukemia, there are two ways to help prevent your cat from contracting the virus. The best thing you can do for your cat to prevent feline leukemia infection is to get it vaccinated against FeLV. There are several types of FeLV vaccines available, but the Nobivac feline 2-FeLV vaccine-a whole inactivated vaccine-has been shown to be more effective than the others. The FeLV vaccine is considered a core vaccine for all cats under one year of age so your veterinarian will recommend this vaccine alongside vaccines for rabies, feline calicivirus, feline herpesvirus-1, and feline panleukopenia.</p><p>The other way to prevent feline leukemia in your cat is to keep your cat away from infected cats. This may be impossible if your cat is an indoor/outdoor cat, but if your cat doesn't leave the house, it is easier. Be sure to keep your house cat away from open windows and doors that infected outdoor cats can approach and transmit the virus through. Additionally, if you know that another cat from another household or a shelter has tested positive for FeLV, do not allow that cat to come into contact with your cat. Have new cats and kittens tested for feline leukemia as part of the adoption process.</p>",721
172,https://www.thesprucepets.com/senior-cat-health-3385079,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Senior Cats,<h1>Signs Your Cat Is Aging and When to See the Vet</h1>,"<h1>Signs Your Cat Is Aging and When to See the Vet</h1><p>Thankfully, due to improvements in veterinary care and nutrition, our feline friends are living much longer than they used to. With our cats living longer, it is important to know the symptoms of common heath issues and when to see your veterinarian.</p><p>Many cats begin to encounter age-related physical and mental changes between seven and ten years of age and due to this, should see their veterinarian twice yearly for wellness exams and diagnostics.</p><p>Below are some common changes you may note as your cat ages, which are a sign you should contact your veterinarian.</p><h2>Behavioral Changes</h2><p>Your cat may be more withdrawn and even start hiding. Our cats are bonded to us and like to be engaged and present where we are. When your cat is suddenly not greeting you at the door, not sleeping with you, or not engaging in its normal activities, it may be a sign that something's wrong.</p><p>Another common behavior change that can be indicative of an underlying medical issue is a change in social interactions. A previously social cat may begin hissing anytime another pet in the house is around. A sick cat may avoid contact with the other animals or humans in the home, despite loving to sleep and interact with them in the past.</p><p>Cats can also uncharacteristically have episodes of aggression. A cat may begin to growl or hiss when people or other pets in the household approach it, may not be comfortable with being held, and may resent being brushed or combed. A painful cat may bite or scratch, especially if someone touches or moves the sensitive area or even if the cat anticipates that you may do it.</p><h2>Less Activity and Low Energy</h2><p>You may notice that your cat has less energy or decreased stamina to engage in previously enjoyable activities, such as playing with toys or chasing that red dot. Your cat may just lay on its side and paw at the wand toys verses chasing the toy. Your cat may be reluctant to jump, walk up or down stairs, have difficulty getting up from laying down, exhibit restlessness, or have difficulty finding a comfortable place to rest. You may also notice changes in sleeping patterns-the cat may sleep more or less, or may sleep in unusual positions and places. These can be symptoms of chronic pain or other medical issues.</p><h2>Litter Box Changes</h2><p>Your formerly fastidious cat may begin missing the box occasionally or not using the box at all. Cats commonly will miss the litter boxes due to the pain associated with going in and out of the litter box, as well as difficulty squatting. Getting into a litter box and holding the squatting position can be very difficult for a cat with sore hips or knees. Other medical issues such as diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and kidney disease can cause cats to have increased frequency or urgency to use the the litter box, which can lead to accidents outside of the box.</p><h2>Changes in Appetite and Water Intake</h2><p>Some conditions can cause a change in your cat's thirst or hunger. You may notice that you are filling your water bowls and fountains more often, or that your cat suddenly is a finicky eater or seems to be eating food constantly without gaining weight. If you notice any changes in your cat's eating and drinking habits, be sure to alert your veterinarian. This could be a sign of pain or various other serious medical issues including kidney disease, diabetes, and hyperthyroidism.</p><h2>Your Cat Seems Disoriented</h2><p>Some aging cats may seem lost or confused in a familiar environment. This can result in them becoming trapped in corners or behind furniture, vocalizing in the middle of the night, staring at walls or into space, or having difficulty finding their resources (food, water bowl, perch, or litter box).</p><p>These can be symptoms of cognitive dysfunction syndrome, which is a result of a decline in cognitive abilities as a result of aging changes in the brain. Cognitive functions include the mental processes of perception, awareness, learning, and memory, which allow an individual to acquire information about the environment and decide how to act. This is sometimes referred to as dementia, as in humans.</p><p>All of the above can be symptoms of a variety of illnesses and are often dismissed by cat caregivers as, My cat is just getting older.Changes in your cat's daily habits should not always be contributed to aging. Age is not a disease, but as your cat ages, it is more likely to be suffering from pain and other medical issues.</p>",760
173,https://www.thesprucepets.com/what-to-expect-as-cat-ages-3384194,Cats > Cat Health & Wellness > Senior Cats,<h1>Senior Cat Health: When Is it Time to See the Vet?</h1>,"<h1>Senior Cat Health: When Is it Time to See the Vet?</h1><p>Nia M. Perkins, DVM is an accomplished veterinary expert with two decades of hands-on small animal clinical experience in private practice and shelters. She founded the award-winning mobile veterinary practice, ""The Housecall Vet,"" and co-founded a small animal and exotics hospital.</p><p>There are some conditions in senior cats that warrant prompt attention. Knowing how to identify clinical signs early on, will hopefully lead to a quick diagnosis and immediate treatment. A cat is considered a senior when they reach the age of seven. At this time, you can expect to see some physical and behavioral changes occur. It is not unusual for them to develop vision and hearing loss, and maybe some dementia. So it is recommended that your senior cat is seen by their veterinarian at least twice a year to make sure these changes aren't affecting their overall health.</p><h2>Arthritis</h2><p>Arthritis, also known as osteoarthritis, is a degenerative disease of the joints. At least 90 percent of cats over 12 years of age have evidence of degenerative joint disease on radiographs. Owners may not relate minor changes in their cat to arthritis, because they may not yet show signs of lameness. This condition should be at the top of the list especially if your senior cat is overweight. Be aware if they are having difficulty grooming, jumping onto furniture, accessing the litter box, and are more irritable than usual. Your veterinarian may recommend some lab tests and radiographs to help diagnose arthritis. Treatment options include pain management, surgery, physical therapy, joint supplementation, cold and heat therapy, muscle toning and strengthening, and acupuncture.</p><h2>Dental Disease</h2><p>Dental disease affects more than half of the cat population over three years of age. Cats have many of the same dental problems as dogs, including periodontal disease, fractured teeth, and oral growths. Cats are also plagued with tooth resorption (a tooth defect where the root erodes and disappears when they are replaced by bone) and inflammation. Pay attention when you notice a decrease in appetite, bad breath, and drooling. On examination, tartar build-up and gum inflammation may be noted. Dental radiographs may be needed to identify the extent of dental disease. Treatment options include a professional dental cleaning, extraction of diseased teeth, removal and/or biopsy of oral growths, antibiotics, and pain management.</p><h2>Kidney Failure</h2><p>The kidneys serve many roles, including water conservation, toxin removal, calcium, phosphorus, pH, and electrolyte balance, blood pressure regulation, and red blood cell production. A pet with impaired kidney function will have a difficult time concentrating urine. It will need to drink extra water to process the body's waste chemicals.</p><p>Initially, an owner may notice their senior cat drinking a little more water than usual. As the disease progresses, the cat may have significant water intake and urine output. Kidney failure is diagnosed through lab testing. This condition is irreversible. Treatment is aimed at slowing down the disease. Treatment options are based on the progression of the disease and may include fluid therapy, diet therapy, and supplements. In severe cases, a blood transfusion may be needed.</p><h2>Diabetes Mellitus</h2><p>Diabetes Mellitus is caused by a deficiency of insulin in the body. Insulin is necessary to remove glucose (sugar) from the bloodstream. When it is low or absent, there is a buildup of glucose. Normally, the kidneys conserve the bloodstream's glucose, but when they are overwhelmed the glucose spills into the urine in high amounts. Glucose draws water with it and eventually leads to increased thirst and urination.</p><p>Diabetes is similar to kidney failure in that clinical signs may be subtle in the beginning. In addition to increased water intake and urine output, a senior cat may experience increased appetite and weight loss. Diabetes Mellitus is diagnosed through bloodwork and urinalysis (examination of the urine). Once diagnosed, your veterinarian will discuss treatment options which will include insulin injections. Also, prescription diets are available. It is possible for a cat to go into remission. So, starting treatment as soon as the condition is diagnosed is important.</p><h2>Hyperthyroidism</h2><p>Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland secretes thyroid hormones in excess. This is the most common endocrine (glands that secrete hormones) disease in cats, and affects late middle-aged and senior cats. Hyperthyroidism affects the entire body, so owners may not realize there is an issue until the disease has progressed. Clinical signs vary, but most owners report that their cat has a voracious appetite with no weight gain, or loss of weight. The diagnosis is based on bloodwork that reveals elevated thyroid hormone levels. Other testing may be necessary to determine the severity of the disease. Treatment options include anti-thyroid medication, anti-thyroid diet, radioiodine therapy, and in some cases, surgery.</p><h3>Symptoms of Hyperthyroidism in Older Cats</h3><h2>Cancer</h2><h3>Watch Now: How Long Do Cats Live?</h3><p>Arthritis And Cats., 2020</p><p>Feline Dental Disease., 2020</p><p>Chronic Kidney Disease., 2020</p><p>Feline Diabetes., 2020</p><p>Hyperthyroidism In Cats., 2020</p><p>Feline Lymphoma., 2020</p>",799
174,https://www.thesprucepets.com/homemade-cat-food-recipes-551946,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>What You Need to Know About Homemade Cat Food</h1>,"<h1>What You Need to Know About Homemade Cat Food</h1><h3>Warning</h3><p>Pet parents may consider home cooking for their pets for many different reasons. This may include concerns related to pet food recalls, health conditions such as food allergies, and/or a desire to provide the best quality foods for their fur babies. The internet is full of recipes and suggestions for the best ways to cook for your cat, so you may be surprised to learn that vets and veterinary nutritionists recommend against this practice. Cats' dietary requirements and the way that they absorb nutrients is extremely complex. Crafting a diet at home that will meet all of their nutritional needs and allow proper absorption of those nutrients is very difficult to do. The risks to your kitty's health can be serious if done improperly. Find out all about your cat's unique dietary needs and alternatives to home cooking.</p><h2>Common Reasons for Wanting to Cook Your Cat's Food</h2><h3>Pet Food Recalls</h3><p>Over the years, there have been pet food recalls for many different reasons. Most of the time, a company voluntarilyrecalls a batch of food if minor problems arise. For more serious risks, the FDA may issue a mandatory recall if there is concern for serious adverse health consequences or death.<cite></cite>When these stories make the news, it understandably creates anxiety for pet parents. At the same time, these recalls let us know that our cats' commercial diets are carefully monitored and tested so that we find these problems quickly and can take action. Feeding a homemade diet may give you more control, however, home cooked diets are also at risk for contamination with potentially dangerous germs and/or unsafe ingredients.</p><h3>Medical Conditions</h3><p>Your kitty may need a diet change if it is diagnosed with certain health conditions. While this may feel overwhelming at first, a change in diet can go a long way to managing certain diseases. For example, special diets are often recommended for cats with diabetes, kidney disease, a food allergy, or urinary tract disorders. Prescription diets are carefully formulated to help treat these medical problems in ways that over-the-counter commercial diets cannot. They should only be used for a cat diagnosed with that specific condition and only under the guidance of your veterinarian.</p><h3>Wanting the Highest Quality Ingredients</h3><p>When you see the ingredients listed in commercial pet food diets, they can sound unappealing or frankly, gross. It raises eyebrows when you read the label and see ""chicken byproduct"" or something equally unappetizing, and it may be more appealing to envision your kitty eating a nice slice of roasted chicken with a side of shrimp. However, what you can't see is the actual nutritional value of these ingredients. In most cases, the ingredient list does not tell the full story since pet food companies can add certain ingredients to improve their image without those ingredients having real nutritional benefits. In other cases, the best nutrients may come from ingredients that sound less appealing but contain more of what your kitty needs.</p><h3>Picky Kitties</h3><p>Most cat owners have been here at some point; you pop open a can of your kitty's favorite food just like you do every day, and all of a sudden, it sniffs it and walks away in complete disgust. This may be a sign that your cat is sick, so you should always check in with your vet when this happens. Other times, it turns out to be a change in your cat's preferences or a behavioral issue. This can be especially frustrating if your healthy cat is turning up its nose at a smorgasbord of options you offer while simultaneously stealing table scraps. It can lead cat owners to think their cat wants human food and that a home cooked diet will appease them. However, it is important to consider other factors such as boredom, fears, or changes in the formulation of the diet as to why your cat is no longer eating its food. If deeper issues are at play, they will arise again, even with a home-cooked diet<cite>. cite</cite></p><h3>Expense</h3><p>Let's face it, high quality commercial cat foods can be expensive. Home cooking for your cat may seem like a way to save money and also provide high quality ingredients. However, to do it properly and provide all of the necessary nutrients for your cat(s) would cost significantly more than most commercial diets on the market. This is because you need to cook a fresh batch of food every few days to avoid spoilage, and you need to purchase many different ingredients and supplements in order to make a balanced diet for your cat.</p><h2>The Unique Nutritional Needs of Cats</h2><p>Cats have special dietary needs that differ from humans and dogs. This is what makes home cooking for them especially challenging. Cats are true carnivores, meaning they require a high content of animal protein as the bulk of their diet. Additionally, they are unable to make certain amino acids and vitamins and must absorb these from their diet.<cite>cite</cite>Wild relatives of cats and outdoor cats usually obtain these nutrients when they eat whole prey. Commercial diets have been carefully formulated to meet these needs as well. However, it is very difficult to meet these needs by cooking for your cat since many of these nutrients come from organ meats, bones, and other parts of prey animals that would not be typically cooked in our homes. For this reason, home cooked diets are usually deficient in crucial nutrients unless they are balanced with a large number of supplements.</p><h2>Risks of Home Cooked Diets</h2><p>It is understandable why you may consider home cooking for your cat if you find yourself in one of the situations mentioned above. However, as you learn more about cats' highly specific dietary needs, the challenges and health risks become more evident. In fact, a study in 2019 showed that over 100 home cooking recipes for cats that were tested and analyzed were deficient in important nutrients and were not as complete as commercial diets.<cite>cite</cite></p><h3>Nutritional Deficiencies</h3><p>Deficiencies in home-cooked diets include taurine, choline, iron, thiamine, and Vitamin E.<cite>cite</cite>Cats that are not getting enough of these nutrients may seem fine for a while, which can reassure owners that their diet is adequate. However, when they do show signs of a deficiency, it can be serious.</p><p>Taurine deficiency can lead to heart disease known as Dilated Cardiomyopathy, blindness due to retinal degeneration, and neurological signs.</p><p>Iron deficiency may cause anemia, which results in cats who are weak, lethargic, and may have rapid breathing as well as risks of collapse or death.</p><p>Thiamine deficiency initially may result in decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. In time, it will lead to serious neurological signs including stumbling, blindness, inability to lift the head, seizures, coma, or even death.</p><p>Choline deficiency often leads to liver problems. In cats, this can trigger Hepatic Lipidosis, or fatty liver disease, which can be serious and challenging to treat.</p><p>Vitamin E deficiency in cats can lead to pansteatitis, a condition where the fat inside the body becomes inflamed and painful.<cite>cite</cite></p><h3>Food-borne Illness</h3><p>In addition to concerns about improperly balanced diets, home cooking also increases the risks of food borne illnesses and/or spoilage. This is because home-cooked foods have a much shorter window of freshness and lack preservatives that can prolong their stability. New batches of food need to be cooked every few days to avoid illnesses related to the growth of bacteria and other harmful germs.</p><h3>Unappealing taste</h3><p>Home-cooked diets are often not as tasty to cats. This is because in order to make them nutritionally complete, many supplements need to be added to the basic ingredients and most cats will be turned off by their taste and/or smell.</p>",1258

There are more brands and styles of cat food on the market than ever before. With so many brands out there, it can seem near impossible to pick the best one for your cat. What are things to look for in a cat food? How can you know you're picking a healthy option?</p> <h2>Basic Nutritional Needs for Cats</h2><p>Cats are considered to be obligate carnivores. This means they require animal protein in their diet in order to obtain adequate nutrition because they can't efficiently synthesize the amino acid taurine from other nutrients. Instead, they need to get it from their diet. Taurine is only found in animal proteins, so it is unhealthy for a cat to be fed a vegetarian diet. A cat fed a diet deficient in taurine can develop a serious heart muscle disease called dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). In fact, DCM used to be one of the most commonly diagnoses acquired heart diseases in cats until researchers discovered the link between taurine deficiency and DCM in cats. A cat fed a taurine deficient diet isn't just at risk of DCM, though. They can also develop central retinal degeneration and reproductive failure.</p><h2>Cat Food Labeling</h2><p>The Association of American Feed Control Officers (AAFCO) is an organization of animal feed specialists who make recommendations for ideal diet compositions for different animals. AAFCO provides recommendations for diets to meet minimum nutrient compositions to avoid risks of malnutrition but does not regulate pet food. Cat food-and pet food in general-are regulated by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA enforces food safety. If a manufacturer has chosen to AAFCO recommendations, its bags and cans of cat food will have an AAFCO statement, sometimes called a nutritional adequacy statement, on them. This statement lets the pet owner know that the diet is complete and balanced for the stated life stage. Complete meaning all the nutrients required for the life stage are present. Balanced meaning all the nutrients are in perfect balance and ratio so as to not provide too little or too much of any nutrient.</p><p>Current life stages recognized by AAFCO are growth/kittens, adult/maintenance, and all life stages. The FDA regulates what nutritional requirements are needed for these life stages based on the recommendations of AAFCO.</p><p>The AAFCO statement will also let you know whether the diet was formulated or whether it underwent feeding trials. Formulated diets are species-specific nutrient content requirements (rather than ingredients), that include minimum needs to provide adequate nutrition and development in an animal, and what is needed to avoid malnutrition.</p><p>Feeding trials are clinical studies that demonstrate the effects of a diet on a set group of animals, and allow a pet food company to demonstrate the healthiness of a diet. This is important because, while multiple proteins may be sources for the same nutrient, that nutrient may be absorbed differently from one protein to another. Additionally, different ingredients may interact differently once broken down into their nutrients, which can also effect how a nutrient is actually absorbed by the cat.</p><h2>A Word on Ingredients</h2><p>In recent years a lot of pet food companies have utilized reading the ingredients in their marketing as a way to prove their wholesomeness to pet owners. The ingredients of a pet food will be listed in descending order of weight, with the first ingredient listed weighing the most and the last weighing the least. This is why a lot of pet foods will have a meat source listed as the first ingredient, because whole meats contain a lot of moisture, which adds weight. Some companies will tell you to steer clear of ""meat meal,"" ""chicken meal,"" etc. but the word ""meal"" just means all moisture has been removed from the meat. This can actually make it a more protein-dense ingredient than the whole source ingredient and may also contain other nutrients, such as glucosamine, to help improve joint health.</p><p>Although a food with chicken as the first ingredient may look like a healthy option, if the next several ingredients are more starch-related and less animal protein-related, that might actually be less nutritionally dense than a pet food that has different protein sources. Meat meal and chicken meal have comparable levels of digestibility when compared to one another.</p><h2>Canned Food vs. Kibble</h2><p>For a long time, and still to this day, there is a debate about whether you should feed a cat dry kibble or a canned diet. Dry cat food is relatively inexpensive and easily allows for &lsquo;free choice' feeding. Dry food can have a long shelf life but once opened should still be kept in an airtight container and used within a month or so of opening. The vitamins and minerals in dry food can begin to degrade if the food is stored open, even in an airtight container, for an extended period of time. This will make it no longer complete or balanced because the vitamins and minerals are no longer able to be absorbed by the cat.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Dry food that has been opened for an extended period can also spoil as the fats in the food can quickly turn rancid.</p><p>Dry food is much more cost effective than canned food, proponents of canned food are concerned about more unnecessary carbohydrates being in dry food than canned food. However, going back to what we know about pet food labeling, if the dry food is labeled to be &lsquo;complete and balanced' that statement alone trumps any concern about too many carbohydrates in the diet. Again, this is because a complete and balanced diet will have all of the nutrients a cat requires and all of them in proper proportion to one another.</p><p>Canned food has a moisture content of 75%. This makes it a great source of water for cats, but it is debatable how much this helps, as some cats may reduce their water intake when eating canned food. Some feel that this increase water content can be beneficial for those cats that may not drink enough, especially when struggling with renal disease or bladder inflammation, where the higher water intake can better flush out the urinary tract. Uneaten canned food should be picked up after a few hours. Additionally, canned food does not provide a hard surface on which to chew, which may affect dental health as well.</p><h2>Grain Free vs. Grain Containing</h2><p>Grain-free diets have been around for over a decade at this point and a popular fad which has proven to have significant health risks for pets. They are marketed as 'premium' and 'holistic' diets for pets, although it should be noted AAFCO doesn't regulateDCM either of those terms, so they truly mean whatever the pet food company wants you to believe they mean. Increased numbers of pets developing DCM have been observed with pets who have been fed grain-free, boutique, or exotic diets. While diet related DCM has been know for some time, in diets deficient in taurine or protein, in recent years there has been a link established between grain free diets and DCM. While most of the research centers around diet-related DCM in dogs, there have been some cases in cats reported as well.</p>",1190
176,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cats-raw-food-552329,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Should You Feed Your Cat a Raw Diet?</h1>,"<h1>Should You Feed Your Cat a Raw Diet?</h1><p>Are raw food diets good for cats? A raw diet requires uncooked animal products instead of regular dry or canned food. Choosing cat food can be overwhelming, especially when we have to worry about commercial pet food recalls. Some owners choose to feed their cats home-prepared diets, so they will know exactly what is in their cat's food. These home-prepared diets may be cooked or raw. Many owners opt for a raw diet that mimics a cat's natural diet in the wild.</p><h2>What Is a Raw Diet for Cats?</h2><p>A raw diet for cats involves feeding them uncooked animal products. This includes muscle meat, organ meat, and bones. This type of food is sometimes called the ""BARF"" diet, which stands for ""bones and raw food"" or ""biologically-appropriate raw food.""</p><p>The ideal raw diet for cats is prepared based on a carefully designed recipe. Many cat owners choose to prepare these diets themselves at home, but commercial forms are also available. If you choose to feed your cat a raw diet, it should be one that has been determined complete and balanced by a veterinary nutritionist. Cats that eat an imbalanced diet are at risk for a variety of health issues.</p><h2>Why Consider It?</h2><p>Felines are obligate carnivores. In short, this means they eat animal products to survive. Cats don't actually need vegetables and carbohydrates in their diets. In fact, they can only tolerate carbohydrates in small amounts. Instead, cats thrive on high-protein, high-moisture diets that are rich in substances only found in meat. This includes amino acids such as taurine, fatty acids, and other essential vitamins and minerals.</p><p>Supporters of raw food diets believe that cooking meat can alter or decrease these vital substances. They advocate for a biologically-appropriate diet that closely mimics what a cat would eat in the wild. In general, small wild cats hunt and eat rodents and other small mammals, birds, fish, insects, and even reptiles. When it comes to feeding your own cat raw food, the idea is to create a diet that is similar.</p><p>There is much controversy revolving around raw food diets for pets. Those who support raw food diets have much to say about the health benefits: coats are shinier, teeth stay cleaner, obesity is prevented, and overall health is better. While these claims tend to ring true, the opposition has valid concerns about the safety of raw food diets.</p><h2>Are Raw Food Diets Safe?</h2><p>It is important to know that feeding raw food to your cat does come with some risks. Raw food may contain pathogens like and that can lead to serious life-threatening infections. Cooking food removes most of these pathogens, which is why we humans tend to cook our food.</p><p>Cats often digest raw foods better than humans because they have shorter, more acidic digestive tracts. Many pathogens will pass through a cat without causing any issues. Most cats will tolerate raw food, but those with health concerns (such as immune-mediated disease) may need cooked food.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest risk of feeding and handling raw meat comes down to cross-contamination. Feeding your cat a raw food diet can expose you and other people in your home to dangerous pathogens. Pathogens may remain on preparation surfaces, food dishes, in cat fecal matter, and even on your cat (especially around the face).</p><p>Raw diets should not be fed to cats living in homes with immune-compromised individuals. They should also be avoided in households with young children and/or elderly people.</p> <p>Bones are another safety concern when it comes to raw food diets. Some small whole bones or pieces of bones can cause complications such as gastrointestinal obstructions, oral injuries, and airway obstructions. If animal bones are included in your cat's raw food diet, they should be ground up well.</p><h2>Complete and Balanced Raw Food Diets</h2><p>One of the biggest mistakes owners make with raw food diets is not making sure the diet is complete and balanced. Some people just feed ""all meat and bones"" or a wide variety of meats without actually paying attention to the calorie, fat, protein, and nutrient content. Do not assume your cat is getting everything needed for good health by simply feeding ""as much meat as desired."" Over time, an incomplete diet can lead to serious health problems for your cat.</p><p>You may think that random raw meat is healthy because feral cats and strays can subsist on this, but it's important to remember that wild animals have shorter life expectancies than domesticated pets. Part of this is due to diet. That's why it's important to follow a vet-approved recipe that is complete and balanced.</p><p>When developing your cat's raw diet, consult with your veterinarian about recipes that offer complete and balanced nutrition for your cat. Know that many vets will not recommend raw diets due to the risks involved. If you feel strongly about trying a raw diet and your vet is not flexible at all about raw diets, seek out a veterinarian who is experienced with raw diets. Better yet, find a veterinary nutritionist with raw diet experience.</p><h2>How to Prepare a Raw Diet for Your Cat</h2><p>It is essential that you find an expert to help you develop a complete and balanced diet that will truly benefit your cat. Your vet may also recommend special supplements to ensure your cat gets the nutrients needed to stay healthy.</p> <p>Preparing a raw diet at home can be a bit time-consuming, so most owners prefer to make enough to last several weeks and keep it frozen.</p><h2>Commercial Raw Diets for Cats</h2><p>If you are not able to take the time to develop recipes and prepare raw food at home, you may wish to try one of the many commercial raw diets available. Raw diet supporters often consider commercial raw diets inferior to those prepared at home. However, they are considered healthier than feeding kibble.</p><p>Commercial raw diets are usually frozen or freeze-dried to reduce pathogens. Remember that safe-handling precautions should still be taken with these diets to prevent cross-contamination. Ask your veterinarian or veterinary nutritionist for help finding the right commercial diet. Make sure it is considered complete and balanced according to AAFCO standards.</p><h2>Raw Diet Alternatives</h2><p>If you would like to eliminate the risks associated with raw food but still feed your cat an optimum diet, consider home-cooked cat food. You will still need to find a recipe that is complete and balanced.</p><p>Or, choose a high-protein wet cat food made with high-quality ingredients. Most vets and experts now agree that dry kibble has too many carbohydrates to be considered optimum for cats. Fortunately, many wet foods are prepared with few carbohydrates or even none at all. Reducing or eliminating carbohydrates in your cat's diet may increase longevity. A low-carb diet can also prevent health issues like obesity and diabetes mellitus in cats.</p>",1118
177,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cat-always-hungry-554001,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Why Is My Cat Always Hungry?</h1>,"<h1>Why Is My Cat Always Hungry?</h1><p>Your cat will display habitual behavior around mealtime when it is hungry, and many cats can be quite demanding that they are served. But cats aren't as motivated by food as dogs, so acting hungry all the time, begging, or whining for food between feedings may point to a medical issue.</p><h2>Crying for Food at Scheduled Meal Times</h2><p>Cats are smarter than you may think, and if you feed them around the same time every day, they'll know when it's mealtime. Meowing, crying, and staring at you until you put food in its bowl are things a hungry cat is great at doing. No, your cat isn't starving, but it probably is hungry. Just like humans, a cat's empty stomach sends signals to its brain to tell it to eat and if you are the person that usually feeds it, your cat will make sure you don't forget its food.</p><h2>Whining for Treats</h2><p>If you keep your cat's treats in a specific place and it sees you standing at that spot, then it may run over and start crying for a treat. This is even more likely to occur if you pick that bag or container up and give it a shake. Cats have excellent hearing and will come running if they hear a familiar, happy sound, especially if they are hungry.</p><h2>Stealing Food From the Table</h2><p>Cats can easily jump onto a counter or table and snatch a piece of chicken or lick a stick of butter. Once they get a taste of something good that isn't in their food dish, it'll be a bad habit you'll have a tough time breaking. Cats are just like any other pet-and many people-who can't resist a tempting treat, so make sure you cover your food if you plan to leave it unattended.</p><p>Cats that are especially active and those that are getting inadequate amounts of food during mealtime may be more likely to steal food off the table. Increasing meal rations or feeding a food higher in calories may help keep your cat from counter surfing if this is the case.</p><h2>Eating Quickly</h2><p>Cats who have had to compete or fight for food are more likely to consume their meals quickly or ravenously. Some cats even grumble or growl while eating and seem to swallow their food without chewing it. This is common with cats who have a history of being strays, feral, or who have come from a large litter of kittens where mealtime resulted in competitive eating if food was scarce.</p><p>Cats that have grown up or gotten into the habit of eating quickly may relax and learn that they need not worry about the availability of their food. After getting regular meals, most cats won't feel compelled to eat as quickly as they can, unless they truly have a medical concern that makes them feel constantly ravenous.</p><h2>Eating and Vomiting</h2><p>Vomiting is not uncommon to see in house cats. They groom themselves extensively so they often have a lot of fur in their digestive tracts, which can form a hairball. If a cat is not able to pass a hairball in its feces, then the fur will either come out when your cat vomits or it will become stuck in its stomach or intestines. If a hairball is lodged in your cat, then it will vomit its food, since the food will be unable to digest. If you suspect your cat has a hairball or other item that is stuck in their gastrointestinal tract, take your pet to the veterinarian. X-rays will show whether your cat needs to have a swallowed item or hairball removed. This removal is often done surgically, but sometimes endoscopy is able to retrieve things from inside the esophagus or stomach.</p><p>Some cats vomit on a regular basis after eating and their food is still intact or whole. This act of vomiting whole food soon after eating is called regurgitation and it usually occurs because the cat ate too quickly. Thankfully, regurgitation is easy to stop by slowing your cat down while it eats. Try spreading its food out on a cookie sheet or place objects that are too large to eat inside your cat's food bowl. You can buy special food bowls with finger-like projections or nubs meant to make your cat work around them and therefore eat slower.</p><h2>Eating and Gaining Weight</h2><p>If your cat is crying for food and is gaining weight, then this is a sign to you that you should feed your cat less, despite what it is trying to tell you. Some cats, like some people, just really like food and the more you feed them, the quicker they'll become overweight and prone to a myriad of medical issues. Diabetes, joint issues, cancer, and more are all more likely to occur in overweight pets. Most cats only require about 1/4 to 1/2 cup of dry kibble a day but this can vary depending on your cat's activity level and how many calories your cat food contains.</p><p>If you have a female cat who has not been spayed and could have had exposure to a male cat who has not been neutered, your cat may be hungry and gaining weight because she is pregnant. If this is the case, make sure you are feeding it a kitten formula to help provide maximum nutrition to the growing kittens inside your cat.</p><h2>Eating and Losing Weight</h2><p>Cats that seem to always be hungry and never gain weight are often diagnosed with some sort of an ailment.</p><p>Thankfully, most cats just love to eat and their day revolves around naps and meals. As long as your cat's weight is stable, it isn't vomiting, having diarrhea, or acting strangely, it is most likely just a food-motivated feline.</p>",950
178,https://www.thesprucepets.com/taurine-for-cats-5073841,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Taurine for Cats</h1>,"<h1>Taurine for Cats</h1><p>Amino acids are the individual compounds that make up all the proteins in both plants and animals. Taurine is one of these amino acids. Most mammals are able to synthesize taurine within their body from other amino acids, but cats cannot synthesize it in adequate enough concentrations, making it an essential amino acid for them. That is, cats to obtain taurine from their diet.</p><h2>What Does Taurine Do and Why Does My Cat Need It?</h2><p>Taurine can serve a variety of purposes in your cat's body. The main function it's known for is in the aid of retinal function as well as heart function, but it can also help with digestion as well as reproductive development. Cats that aren't getting enough taurine in their daily diet can develop an array of symptoms in relation to these functions. The symptoms won't manifest immediately, but may take anywhere from five months to two years to surface.</p><p>Prolonged retinal degeneration that is left untreated can lead to blindness in your cat. While supplementing your cat's diet with taurine can slow down or even stop the progression of retinal degeneration, it won't reverse any blindness your cat may have suffered before supplementation.</p><p>If your cat's taurine-related dilated cardiomyopathy is caught early enough and if it is in turn treated with dietary supplements, the effects can be reversed. If left untreated, though, DCM can lead to heart failure and death.</p><p>In pregnant cats, low taurine can lead to smaller litter sizes and smaller birth weights, in addition to other congenital abnormalities. If the kittens are, in turn, fed a taurine-deficient diet, they can have delayed growth and development.</p><h2>How Does My Cat Get Their Taurine?</h2><p>Taurine was first discovered to be an essential amino acid in cats in the 1980s. As such, all commercial cat food has been supplemented with taurine to provide your cat with his/her needed concentrations. Taurine is found in animal tissue, making cats obligate carnivores.</p><p>Pet food companies and researchers discovered that not all of the taurine they put into canned cat food is usable by your cat's body. This is due in part to the heat applied during the processing of canned cat food. The pet food companies have compensated for this by adding more taurine in their wet food formulations than dry food. So long as your are feeding a commercial cat food that is appropriate for your cat's age group (growth, adult maintenance, gestation/lactation) you can rest assured that there is enough taurine in your cat's diet.</p><p>It is important to note that when checking for the life stage of your cat's food, you should not rely solely on what is in giant font on the front of the bag, but also rather what the AAFCO statement says. AAFCO is the pet food regulating body and an AAFCO statement is typically found on the back or side panel and near the guaranteed analysis and/or ingredient list. In addition to telling you what life stage the food you is for, the AAFCO statement will tell you if the food has been or if it has been .</p><p>Formulated simply means the pet food company followed the guidelines put forth by AAFCO to make a pet food for that species and for that life stage. Tested means the pet food company not only followed the guidelines but then also put the food through diet trials to ensure that it was healthy, complete, and safe for your pet to eat.</p><p>If you feed your cat a prescription diet, the levels of taurine in the diet are factored into formulating the diet to treat your pet's illness. If you home cook for your cat, you don't necessarily need to add a taurine supplement in if there is adequate taurine levels in your protein source, but review your specific recipe with your vet to ensure that your cat is getting all of the nutrients they need, including vitamins and minerals.</p><h2>Do I Need to Give My Cat a Taurine Supplement?</h2><p>Supplementing your cat's diet with additional taurine isn't always necessary. Again, all commercially available cat foods have enough taurine in them for their labeled life stage. If your cat has a taurine deficiency related illness, your cat may require supplementation in addition to eating an appropriate diet, at least until symptoms dissipate. Supplementation may also be required if the majority of your cat's diet is not from a commercial food.</p><p>Supplementing your cat's diet with taurine is relatively safe and supplements are readily available over-the-counter. You always want to check with your vet before starting your cat on a taurine supplement, though. This is because the FDA does not regulate supplements like it does medications, so not all supplements are created equal. Your vet can help point you in the right direction about what taurine supplement to choose.</p><p>Taurine is a vitally important amino acid that all cats in their daily diet. If you have concerns about your cat not getting enough taurine, speak with your vet. They can help you troubleshoot areas of your cat's diet and help answer any question you have about your cat's food.</p> ",842
179,https://www.thesprucepets.com/is-coconut-oil-safe-for-cats-4706850,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Is Coconut Oil Safe for Cats?</h1>,"<h1>Is Coconut Oil Safe for Cats?</h1><p>Coconut oil has been used in cooking for decades but within the past several years its popularity as a holistic remedy has skyrocketed. Supporters rave about the numerous health benefits of coconut oil for humans. In fact, it has become so popular that some people are starting to give it to their cats for the same benefits they are seeing in themselves.</p><p>Is coconut oil beneficial or harmful for cats? Well-meaning cat owners should learn the facts about coconut oil before administering it to their cats.</p><h2>What Is Coconut Oil?</h2><p>Coconut oil comes from mature coconuts and can be used in both food and health products. It contains saturated fatty acids called medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs). MCTs, which also include palm kernel oil, are more readily digested than long-chain triglycerides (such as olive oil, soybean oil, avocado oil, and fish oil). As such, MCTs are considered a better source of quick energy than long-chain triglycerides and are less likely to turn into fat in the body. MCTs can be composed of different fatty acid chains, including caprylic acid and capric acid, both of which have shown anti-fungal properties in lab studies. They also contain lauric acid, which has shown anti-fungal as well as anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. Coconut oil can contain caprylic, capric, and lauric acid, so it's understandable that people would be excited about its potential health benefits.</p><h2>Does Coconut Oil Have Real Benefits?</h2><p>While there are anecdotal claims of coconut oil's health benefits, it is important to understand that these claims are not exactly supported by science. Studies have been largely inconclusive and mainly on human subjects. This is not to say that coconut oil is useless or harmful; it is only to clarify that the effects of coconut oil are not proven in cats.</p><p>Coconut oil and other foods containing MCTs theoretically have antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. Some believe that the MCTs found in coconut oil may also aid in digestion, ease digestive disorders, and prevent hairballs in cats. Another theory is that MCTs may help with brain energy and cognition in older cats.</p><p>Some owners feel that the use of coconut oil, either orally or topically, can improve the condition of their cat's coat, and can also alleviate dry or itchy skin. Further theories suggest that it may help with metabolic functions, aid in weight loss, alleviate pain from arthritis as well as improve bone health.</p><p>It's important to remember that these are unsubstantiated claims without any scientific proof.</p><h2>Is Coconut Oil Safe for My Cat?</h2><p>All of the potential benefits mentioned make coconut oil sound like the latest miracle cure-all. You may even be using it yourself and experiencing some benefits. If you think coconut oil might be a good option for your cat, you should first consult your veterinarian for advice. Although coconut oil is not poisonous to cats, it may not be the ideal addition to every cat's diet. Any change in diet, supplements, or medications can affect your cat's health. Depending on your cat, increased fat in the diet may lead to weight gain or digestive issues. Your veterinarian knows your cat's history and physical condition and can help you make the right decision.</p><p>In general, the use of coconut oil is not something typically recommended by veterinarians. That is mainly because the potential benefits listed above are reported by owners, not backed up by science. In order to determine the safety and effectiveness of coconut oil, it must be studied in a controlled setting with a large testing population that is repeatable and peer-reviewed. A study on a small number of cats published in 1985 found that the cats would avoid diets with even low levels of MCTs, meaning that cats likely find them unpalatable. So, while your friendly neighborhood pet supply store employee may swear by a coconut oil remedy that worked on their cat, there is really no way of knowing whether it will have the same effect on your cat or not.</p><h2>How Can I Use Coconut Oil?</h2><p>If coconut oil might not be all that it's cracked up to be, how exactly do you go about using it for your cat? First of all, do not use coconut oil on your cat until you speak with your veterinarian, who will be able to tell you which uses are appropriate, and in which amounts.</p><p>Topical use may seem safe and fairly easy to administer for skin issues. However, your cat will most likely lick off the oil after it has been applied. This means the cat ingests the oil and potentially irritates the skin in that area. You can use an over-the-counter shampoo with organic coconut oil (although most cats don't usually appreciate getting a full bath), but make sure it is intended for use on cats.</p><p>Oral use may be an option if your vet approves. Make sure you follow your vet's advice for quantity and frequency and formula. They will be able to tell you a proper dosage so that you don't accidentally give too much at a time and end up with a greasy, diarrhea mess on your hands. They can also advise you on the risks versus benefits of oral coconut oil if your cat is prone to gaining weight, or has a history of pancreatitis, irritable bowel disorder, or any other disease or metabolic condition.</p>",883
180,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-cats-have-raw-eggs-5218901,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Can Cats Have Raw Eggs?</h1>,"<h1>Can Cats Have Raw Eggs?</h1><p>The American Egg Board has never let us forget that eggs are a staple, especially in breakfast food. Plus, they can be prepared a myriad of ways. Does this apply to your cat, though? Can you feed your cat raw eggs, or should you cook them first?</p><h2>Are Raw Eggs Safe For Cats?</h2><p>Many proponents of raw feeding in cats tout raw eggs as a great addition to a cat's raw diet because they are packed with protein. They may also believe that cooking the egg will denature the proteins, making them less usable for your cat's body and digestive system.</p><p>One of these proteins, called avidin, can actually be harmful when ingested in its raw form. This is because avidin, in its raw form, bonds very tightly to Vitamin B7, also called biotin. Biotin is a water-soluble vitamin, which means it isn't stored in the body as long as fat soluble vitamins. Cats use biotin for protein and fat metabolism. It is also utilized in your cat's adrenal glands, thyroid gland, nervous system, and their skin, fur, and nails. Cats that are routinely fed raw eggs for an extended period of time may start to exhibit signs of biotin deficiency, which may include a shabby hair coat, skin lesions and hair loss, especially on the face and legs, decreased appetite, and diarrhea. Cooking eggs denatures the avidin in the egg white. This means it makes it less likely to lead to biotin deficiency because denatured avidin cannot bind as readily to biotin.</p><p>Another risk associated with feeding raw eggs is bacterial contamination. Feeding your cat raw eggs puts them at risk of ingesting live cultures of and/or that may be contaminating the eggs. Both of these bacteria can cause your cat to be very sick. and in cats can cause a variety of symptoms, including vomiting and diarrhea, anorexia and weight loss, fever, lethargy, dehydration, abnormal tachycardia (a fast heart rate), and swollen lymph nodes. If left untreated, they both can also lead to a life threatening condition called septicemia. Septicemia is, quite literally, an infection in a cat's blood stream and requires immediate veterinary attention. The and in raw eggs aren't just a concern for your cat. You also could be at risk of Salmonellosis and/or Colibacillosis, either from handling the raw eggs yourself or by contracting it from your cat.</p><p>Of course, and is are concerns for raw feeding as well. However, there are some commercial raw diets that undergo a process called high pressure pasteurization that successfully kills any bacteria in the food without having to cook it. If you are thinking about feeding your cat a raw diet, it's definitely something to keep in mind when choosing whether to do home made raw or commercial raw.</p><h2>Health Benefits of Eggs for Cats</h2><p>Raw eggs are unsafe for cats to eat, but that doesn't mean that, when properly prepared, they don't provide a nutritious snack for your cat. The proteins and amino acids found in eggs can actually make them a healthy snack option for some cats. Cats, being strict carnivores, need animal protein in their diet, and eggs are believed to be nutritionally complete when it comes to protein.</p><h2>Dangers of Eggs for Cats</h2><p>Aside from the dangers of raw eggs, there are considerations before feeding your cat cooked eggs. While the white is protein packed, the yolk contains much more fat. This can not only predispose a cat to obesity, but it can also put a cat at risk of of pancreatitis, a painful inflammation of the pancreas. Diabetic cats may be especially at risk of pancreatitis. The shell can be a source of calcium, but take care in how it is prepared to avoid causing irritation to a cat's mouth or the lining of their gastrointestinal tract.</p><p>Additionally, if your cat is otherwise healthy and on a commercial diet, whether raw or traditional, it shouldn't need calcium supplementation. Too much calcium can be detrimental to all of your cat's organ systems, but especially to your cat's kidneys, nervous system, and their cardiovascular system.</p><h2>How to Feed Eggs to Your Cat</h2><p>If you want to treat your cat to an egg, the safest way to do so is to boil it or scramble it with no salt or seasonings. If your cat is susceptible to gastrointestinal upset or pancreatitis, feed only the egg white. This will help minimize the ingestion of extra fats that may aggravate your cat's GI tract. Keep in mind that any diet change or new treat can lead to diarrhea or stomach upset. If you do feed your cat the cooked yolk portion, do so only in moderation. One whole egg contains a large percentage of a cat 's daily calorie requirement, so cats should be fed partial eggs as an occasional treat.</p>",795
181,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-dogs-eat-raw-chicken-feet-5222388,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Feet?</h1>,"<h1>Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Feet?</h1><p>Many pet stores stock raw or dehydrated treats for dogs, including chicken feet. Some companies tout the health benefits of chicken feet, including dental and joint health benefits. But are raw chicken feet safe for your dog to eat? What should you know before giving your dog one to munch on?</p><h2>Can Dogs Eat Raw Chicken Feet?</h2><p>Proponents of feeding your dog chicken feet say that because chicken feet are full of glucosamine and chondroitin, they can be a great, nutritious snack for older and aging dogs. In fact, supplementing an elderly dog with glucosamine and chondroitin can help soothe achy joints. Proponents of feeding dogs raw chicken feet also state that, because chicken feet are<br />mostly bones and ligaments, they also make great dental treats as the crunchy bones and connective tissues can help break up any tartar on the teeth. However, the fact remains that it's still raw chicken. The biggest risk of feeding your dog a raw diet or raw treats is the risk of parasites and bacteria. Studies show that between 20-48% of raw meat based diets tested were contaminated with and 18 of the strains found were resistant to 12 of the 16 antibiotics there were tested against. In another, small study, 80% of tested homemade raw chicken diets tested positive for and 30% of the stools tested were also positive.</p><p>Raw chicken, however, doesn't just carry a risk of Salmonellosis. It can be contaminated with other types of bacteria as well. Chicken sold in stores and meant for human consumption has been shown to test positive for at a rate of 29% to 74% and at a rate of 15% to 34%. With that in mind, chicken feet from the butcher shop may not be the safest option.</p><h2>What About Cooked Chicken Feet?</h2><p>If there are risks of bacterial infection with feeding raw chicken feet does cooking the chicken feet make them safer? Unfortunately, cooking chicken feet probably only makes them more dangerous for your dog. This is because of all the bones within the feet that contribute to the claims of joint and teeth benefits. When chicken bones are cooked they become incredibly brittle and can splinter easily. Splintered bits of chicken bone can be as sharp as a scalpel blade and can easily perforate a dog's gastrointestinal tract. This can lead to life threatening peritonitis and sepsis. The process of dehydrating meats into jerky type treats does involve keeping the meat at a temperature between 130 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the process to prevent bacterial contamination. Subjecting chicken feet to these temperatures for the time it takes to dehydrate them may be enough to turn the bones brittle, so dehydrated chicken feet treats, whether store-bought or homemade, may not be safe.</p><h2>What About Other Raw Animal Products?</h2><p>Chicken feet aren't the only raw treats at boutique pet shops. Some stores even have a raw bar, where you can help yourself to bulk bins of raw chicken hearts, duck hearts, bully sticks, chicken and duck necks, etc. Most of these are freeze dried, but you might want to contact the manufacturer to check if the label at the store doesn't make it obvious.</p><p>Dehydrating meats has been long used to make jerky for people and in recent years more people have been dehydrating meats to make jerky for their pets. The process of dehydrating removes all water from the meat, which prevents bacteria from proliferating, but dehydrating by itself doesn't always kill any bacteria already present in the meat.</p><p>The current USDA recommendation for jerky is to first freeze the raw meat for up to three days, thaw in the refrigerator, and then heat it to 160 degrees Fahrenheit, either by steaming or roasting. Once the thickest part of the meat has reached this internal temperature, the dehydrating process can begin. It is not recommended to dehydrate meat into jerky in open air but rather using an artificial heat source. The USDA advises keeping the meat at a steady and constant<br />temperature between 130 degrees Fahrenheit and 140 degrees Fahrenheit throughout the dehydrating process as this prevents any parasites or bacteria from growing on the meat during the actual dehydration process.</p><p>While chicken feet may being high in glucosamine and chondroitin may make them seem like healthy, natural treats for your dog, the risks of feeding them outweigh any benefit. Additionally, there are safe glucosamine/chondroitin supplements derived from just as natural ingredients. There are also a variety of dental treats and chews on the market that don't come with risks of intestinal parasites or gastrointestinal perforations. If you have questions about joint supplements or dental health in your dog, or about raw or freeze-dried treats for your dog, speak to your veterinarian..</p>",787
182,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-cats-eat-blueberries-4844176,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Can Cats Eat Blueberries?</h1>,"<h1>Can Cats Eat Blueberries?</h1><h2>Rich in antioxidants, blueberries can boost your cat's health</h2><p>The health benefits of blueberries are abundant. Blueberries contains vitamins, antioxidants, fiber and other compounds that help boost health in many ways, from supporting urinary-tract function to fighting cancer. People and dogs enjoy blueberries, but what about cats? Can cats eat blueberries safely, and if so, how many blueberries can a cat eat?</p><p>Some fruits are safe for cats to eat and some are not. As it turns out, blueberries are safe to feed to cats. In general, though, cats don 't eat much fruit. Unlike dogs, which are omnivores, cats are classified as obligate carnivores.This means that the majority of a cat 's diet must be comprised of meat-cats don 't require fruits and vegetables in their diet. For this reason, cats crave savory foods the most. In fact, you might be surprised to learn that domesticated cats physically cannot taste sweet things-they lack the specific taste receptor (called the TAS1R2 gene) required to be able to identify sweet flavors.</p><p>But how can this be?you might ask. My cat loves ice cream!Interestingly, some cats do enjoy eating things like ice cream and yogurt. Researchers have theorized that cats are in fact drawn to the fat content of foods like ice cream and yogurt, rather than the sweetness of these foods. (It 's important to note that cats should only eat very small amounts of dairy foods like ice cream and yogurt. Cats are lactose intolerant, which means they cannot digest the lactose that 's found in milk and milk products, so dairy foods can give cats stomach upset, including diarrhea and vomiting.)</p><h2>The Benefits of Blueberries for Cats</h2><p>Blueberries are considered a superfood, which is a food that provides additional health benefits above and beyond wholesome nutrition. Although most research about the health benefits of blueberries has been done on humans (and to a smaller extent, dogs), the known health benefits of blueberries might also help cats too.</p><p>Blueberries contain high levels of antioxidants (compounds that fight free radicals, slowing damage to the cells of the body). Antioxidants can slow the aging process and they may even fight cancer. Blueberry fiber can help reduce inflammation throughout the body, potentially easing conditions like arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease. Blueberries also support urinary-tract health (as do cranberries).</p><h2>Potential Health Concerns</h2><p>Although it 's safe and possibly even beneficial to feed your cat small amounts of blueberries as a treat in addition to her complete-and-balanced cat food, there is such a thing as too much of a good thing. Again, because cats are obligate carnivores, the majority of a cat 's diet should be meat. Although cats can eat and digest fruits and vegetables, too much could potentially cause stomach upset. Your cat should be eating high-quality, complete-and-balanced diet that meets a cat 's unique nutritional needs. Commercial cat foods include a statement on the label that states if the product is complete and balancedas certified by the American Association of Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). The complete-and-balanced statement on a cat food label means that the cat will get all the essential nutrients she needs, in the correct balance, as required for that life stage: adult maintenance (for adult cats), growth and reproduction (for kittens and pregnant or nursing females), or all life stages (for all cats, whether kittens or adults).</p><p>Any other food you feed your cat, including blueberries, should make up no more than 10% of your cat 's total diet (the remaining 90% should be your cat 's complete-and-balanced food). Because cats are small, limit blueberries to one to three blueberries per day.</p><h2>What Kind of Blueberries Can Cats Eat?</h2><p>Cats can eat fresh or cooked blueberries. Choose organic blueberries if you 're concerned about pesticides and other chemicals used to grow them. Even if you buy organic, always wash blueberries before feeding them to your cat.</p><h2>Safe Ways to Feed Blueberries to Your Cat</h2><p>If you can get your cat to eat blueberries, they can be a healthy treat for most cats. In fact, some commercial cat foods contain blueberries as an ingredient.</p><p>It 's always best to talk to your veterinarian before adding any new foods like blueberries to your cat 's diet. After you get your veterinarian 's OK you can give blueberries a try. Since cats can 't taste sweet things, they will be drawn to other qualities of blueberries. For instance, cats like new and interesting textures, so your cat might think it 's fun to chew on blueberries. Cats also like to eat wet foods, so a juicy blueberry might be just the ticket.</p><p>You might be surprised at your cat 's willingness to try blueberries as a treat. Try offering your cat whole raw blueberries, or cut them in half or smash them so your cat can see and smell the juicy insides. If your cat doesn 't seem interested, you can try mixing chopped raw blueberries or mashed cooked blueberries into your cat 's food. If your cat just doesn 't seem interested in eating blueberries, don 't force the issue.</p>",841
183,https://www.thesprucepets.com/how-much-canned-food-to-feed-554404,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>How Much Wet Food to Feed a Cat Every Day</h1>,"<h1>How Much Wet Food to Feed a Cat Every Day</h1><p>Once you find the right type of wet food, you need to figure out how much to feed your cat. General guidelines are available for how much wet food to feed cats of any shape and size. For example, a 5-pound cat with a lean body type needs about 170 calories per day, and a 10-pound cat with a lean body type needs about 280 calories per day.</p><h2>Why Do Cats Need Wet Food?</h2><p>Many veterinarians recommend that cats eat a diet of exclusively or mostly wet food. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, cats are obligate carnivores and are not designed to ingest many carbohydrates (if any). Dry food will automatically contain many more carbohydrates than wet food. For many cats, dry food consumption leads to obesity.</p><p>Secondly, most cats are not big water drinkers and tend to keep themselves on the edge of dehydration. Wet food naturally provides more water in the diet, which supports the kidneys, urinary tract, and overall health.</p><h2>Should You Feed Your Cat Both Wet and Dry Food?</h2><p>First, determine if you will be feeding your cat a 100 percent wet food diet or including some dry food. While the gold standard is to feed all wet food to cats, some cats love dry food and will undereat if they are only given wet food. In addition, dry food is more affordable, so feeding part dry will be easier on your budget.</p><p>Feeding a mix of wet and dry may require a bit of math to make sure your cat is getting the appropriate number of calories. One easy starting point is to look at the recommended daily feeding amounts on each type of food and halve them.</p><p>Once you have settled on the ratio of wet-to-dry, it's time to determine the calorie count of the food. Make sure you are feeding a quality diet that's listed as ""complete and balanced"" by AAFCO. Then, determine the number of calories per portion.</p><h2>How Much Wet Food Does Your Cat Need?</h2><p>Your cat's caloric needs depend on several factors. Your cat's weight can give you a basic guideline of how much to feed. However, it's essential to determine your cat's body condition. A lean, muscular cat with a large frame may weigh 15 pounds and be at a healthy weight. This cat will require more calories to maintain that healthy weight. However, a 15-pound cat with a more petite frame will be overweight and need fewer calories. The overweight cat should be fed according to its ideal weight, not its actual weight.</p><p>Age and activity level also play a role in determining the proper amount of calories needed. A growing kitten needs many more calories than an adult or senior cat. An active cat that runs and plays frequently will need more calories than a cat that remains sedentary most of the time. A nursing mother needs extra calories to produce milk and stay healthy.</p><p>If you wish to be accurate in calculating the number of calories you feed your cat, then start by finding out how many calories your cat needs.</p><h2>Cat Food Guidelines</h2><p>It's acceptable to use the feeding recommendations on the packaging as a starting point for how much to feed. The website for the diet may go into greater detail about feeding guidelines. The amount you feed may need to be adjusted based upon how your cat responds. If you notice undesired weight gain or loss, the amount should be adjusted. If your cat seems extremely hungry and is not gaining weight, it's acceptable to increase the amount you feed.</p><p>Many wet foods come in three-ounce cans and recommend feeding approximately one can a day for every three to three and a half pounds of body weight. However, brands vary.</p><p>A happy, healthy cat will maintain a good weight and stay active. A properly fed cat will not act hungry all the time but will also maintain a healthy weight.</p><p>Remember to visit your veterinarian for annual or biannual wellness exams to make sure your cat is as healthy as possible.</p><p>Two hours. If your kitty doesn't eat it all in one sitting, offer smaller portions a few times a day.</p><p>If your cat won't eat wet food, it could be because they prefer the texture of dry or moist food, or that they like their food at a different temperature. If your cat refuses to eat completely, you need to call your veterinarian ASAP.</p><p>Many cats try to bury their food when they have finished eating. It's instinctual: Cats bury their food to keep it safe from predators.</p>",760
184,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-cats-eat-salami-4798669,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Can Cats Eat Salami?</h1>,"<h1>Can Cats Eat Salami?</h1><h2>Salami is OK to offer your cat in moderation</h2><p>Cat owners know that the primary staple in their pet's diet should be meat, as they don 't derive nutrition from fruits or vegetables the way humans (or even dogs) can. And while chicken, beef, and fish are all fine options, is salami also on the list of cat-friendly meats?</p><p>A form of cured sausage that typically blends beef and pork, salami (and its popular pizza topping relative, pepperoni) is technically safe to offer your cat. In fact, a Google search of ""can cats eat salami?"" inspired a viral article and series of popular memes last year. However, cute cat memes aside, salami still may not be the best humanfood to be sharing with your feline friend.</p><h2>Is Salami Safe for Cats?</h2><p>One of the potential issues with salami is that it isn 't actually a cooked meat like pork or beef; instead, salami is prepared by fermenting and air-drying. So that means there 's always the risk of it being contaminated with bacteria like Salmonella or Trichinellosis, another lesser-known parasitic disease.</p><p>While it 's relatively rare, salami has been the culprit of Salmonella poisoning in the past (one outbreak in 2010 impacted hundreds of people). So sharing salami with your cat will always post a slight risk, even though Salmonella doesn 't seem to affect cats in the same way as humans. However, if your cat has been affected by salmonella, cat owners should be on the lookout for symptoms ranging from vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain to lack of appetite, dehydration, and high fever.</p><h2>Dangers of Feeding Cats Salami</h2><p>Pregnant cats, in particular, shouldn 't be offered salami; much like human moms-to-be are urged to avoid uncooked foods and deli meats, pregnant cats should also avoid this particular meat. In severe cases, septicaemia and endotoxemia may develop, which are life-threatening conditions that can spread to different organs and cause pneumonia and meningitis in cats-and cause miscarriage in cats that are already pregnant.</p><p>Likewise, kittens haven 't fully developed their immune system, so any toxins and bacteria lurking in that piece of salami are even more likely to make the youngest kitties sick. Avoid offering your kitten salami, and if you do, it should be a very small amount and only on special occasions.</p><p>Another drawback to cats eating salami is that it puts kitties at risk for obesity and other weight-related issues. Its high salt content isn't recommended for cats. To put it into perspective, one piece of pepperoni is packed with about 35 mg of sodium, but the recommended sodium intake for an average-sized cat over the course of an entire day is only about 42 mg. While some research has indicated that cats can actually tolerate a bit of extra sodium, it 's well-known that too much salt puts humans at risk for an array of health issues, ranging from hypertension to kidney disease, so it may not be worth the risk. For cats who are already suffering from kidney or renal disease, your veterinarian will more than likely suggest a lower-sodium diet and skipping treats like salami.</p><p>While cats process fat differently than humans, salami is also fairly high in saturated fat, which could also increase their risk for obesity. Additionally, salami often contains spices like chili peppers and paprika that can upset their stomach. Though the amount of spice in a piece of salami probably won 't lead to any major health issues, they could still cause indigestion and an upset stomach. However, other ingredients that may be found in that piece of salami, like garlic, can cause far more serious consequences for your kitty-garlic is toxic to both cats and dogs, as it contains chemicals that can either damage or destroy red blood cells.</p><h2>How to Share Salami With Your Cat</h2><p>In general, always be sure to double check with your veterinarian before offering people foodlike salami to your cat, and start with small amounts to see how your cat tolerates it. For the most part, if your cat is begging for a sample of salami then it's okay to let him or her enjoy a few nibbles every now and then--but it's certainly not a human food that should be offered to your pet on a regular basis.</p><p>And what about sharing the topping of that pepperoni pizza? Pepperoni tends to be more spicy than salami, and is still chock full of sodium, so it 's still not the best snack for your cat. When choosing a salami for your cat, try to track down a more natural variety made with meat and fat and only moderate amounts of added salt (and sans any potentially toxic ingredients like garlic).</p>",778
185,https://www.thesprucepets.com/can-cats-eat-cheese-5323852,Cats > Cat Nutrition & Food,<h1>Can Cats Eat Cheese?</h1>,"<h1>Can Cats Eat Cheese?</h1><p>Cheese is a staple food item in most homes. In fact, it 's so commonplace, some pet owners may use it to hide pet medications in. Can cats eats cheese, though?</p><h2>Is Cheese Safe for Cats to Eat?</h2><p>Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they need animal protein in order to get all their required nutrients. That doesn't mean they only eat meat, though. In fact, one study showed that domestic cats, have a daily diet consisting of 52 percent protein, 36 percent fat, and only 12 percent coming from carbohydrates. So clearly they eat things besides meat. But does that mean they can and should eat cheese?</p><p>Cheese, like all dairy products, contains the milk sugar lactose. When kittens are first born, they have the proper enzymes to digest these sugars as they live off their mother 's milk for the first few months of their life. As they are weaned off of their mother 's milk, their production of lactulose, the enzyme needed to digest lactose begins to wane. In fact, by the time most kittens reach the age of one year, they stop producing it altogether. This means that most adult cats can 't actually digest lactose.</p><p>When an adult cat consumes anything with lactose, instead of being digested, the lactose is fermented in the intestines. This can cause both bloating and flatulence. Additionally, water is drawn into the intestines instead of out, causing diarrhea.</p><p>It 's important to note that the response of a cat 's gastrointestinal tract to dairy is not the same thing as to an actual food allergen. When a cat ingests a food they are allergic to, the physiological response is immune mediated. When a cat eats dairy, they don 't get GI upset as a result of a food allergy but because they simply can 't digest it.</p><h2>How Often Can Cats Eat Cheese?</h2><p>Cheese, like all dairy products, contains lactose, although not in as high of concentrations as actual milk. This is because of how cheese is made. Cheese making involves separating the curds, what is used to make cheese, from the whey. The whey actually contains most of the lactose, but some still exists in the curd.</p><p>Cow 's milk, whether whole, two percent, one percent, or skim has between nine and 14 grams of lactose. Pasteurized and processed American cheese, however, has just between 0.5 and four grams. So while cats can 't actually digest cheese, they can tolerate it in small amounts, or enough to be able to use cheese to hide medications.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that cheese is a very calorie-dense food, and just a small amount can end up meeting your cat's calorie requirement for the entire day! Since pet obesity is a huge problem, don't forget to factor in calories of cheese when considering if you should feed it to your cat or not.</p><h2>What About Non-Dairy Cheese?</h2><p>As eating a plant based diet becomes more popular in human culture, there are more and more cheese alternatives available on the market. You may be tempted to try non-dairy cheese for your cat as a way to get around the whole lactose thing, but this might actually be no better.</p><p>Some cheeses, whether dairy or non-dairy, may also contain herbs that may be more concerning than just lactose. Things like garlic and onion may be incorporated into some cheese varieties and both of these can be toxic to cats. In addition, non-dairy cheeses may contain more oils and fats than standard dairy cheese would. Fatty foods can lead to weight gain and may also cause GI upset, including pancreatitis.</p><h2>What Should You Do If Your Cat Eats Too Much Cheese?</h2><p>If your cat manages to eat more than a few nibbles of cheese, don 't fret quite yet. Monitor your cat for GI signs, such as diarrhea and decreased appetite. If you fear they got into too much cheese, contact your local veterinarian or a pet poison hotline, such as the ASPCA Pet Poison Control.</p><p>Let them know what kind of cheese your cat got into and a rough estimate of how much you think they ate. They will be able to give better insight about what to watch out for, if veterinary medical attention is required, and what treatment should entail.</p><p>So, while some cats can tolerate cheese, they should only consume it in small amounts. Using it as a high value reward for administering medications or even training is usually fine, but it should not be a staple of their diet nor a treat given in high amounts.</p>",755
