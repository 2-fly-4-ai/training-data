The Vasa Parrot is about the same size as another gray parrot, the African Grey, but the Vasa Parrot's body shape is much different. Owing to its particularly long neck, smallish head, long legs, long feet and long rectangular tail, the Vasa Parrot is sometimes described as ""so ugly its cute."" However, beauty is in the eye of the beholder and the Vasa Parrot has more to offer than simple good looks. Although it has a somewhat awkward appearance and is not as brilliantly colored as some other parrots, this sweet bird's exceptional personality makes it a wonderful pet. In the birding community, Vasa Parrots are much less common than other species, but interest is rising as word gets out about the Vasa Parrot's endearing nature.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Vasa Parrot, Greater Vasa Parrot , Lesser Vasa Parrot </p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:About 20 inches (17 ounces) long</p><p>Life Expectancy:Up to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Vasa Parrot is a dark-grey parrot belonging to thefamily of birds. There are two species of Vasa Parrot: the Greater Vasa Parrotand the Lesser Vasa ParrotThe Lesser Vasa Parrot is also known as the black parrot. Both Vasa Parrot species are found on two island countries off the eastern coast of Africa: Madagascar and the Comoros. The two species prefer different habitats, with the Greater Vasa Parrot living in dry forest areas and the Lesser Vasa Parrot living in humid forest areas.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Vasa Parrots tend to be affectionate, easy-going birds that are friendly with the entire family rather than being one-person birds. Vasa Parrots are intelligent, active, busy and very playful. Female Vasa Parrots might become moody, territorial or aggressive during mating season. A Vasa Parrot should be out of its cage as much as possible so it can play and interact with its human family. As with most parrots, Vasa Parrots demand a great deal of your time and attention in order to be happy. Never ignore or leave a Vasa Parrot alone for extended periods of time.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Talkative without being ear piercing, Vasa Parrots are will express themselves with various distinct calls, squawks and whistles. Some Vasa Parrots can learn to speak and some do not speak any words.</p><h2>Vasa Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Both male and female Vasa Parrots are a dark-gray color all over with a grayish-black beak. During the mating season in the fall (October to December), a female Vasa Parrot's feathers transform to a light brown color, and she molts the feathers on her head, going bald. The Vasa Parrot's skin also turns yellow during the mating season. This happens in both male and female Vasa Parrots, although the color change is more dramatically seen in the female due to the exposed to exposed skin on her bald head. Additionally, the beaks of male and female Vasa Parrots lighten until they are nearly white during mating season.</p><h2>Caring for theVasa Parrot </h2><p>The Vasa Parrot needs a large enclosure. An aviary, flight cage or very large parrot cage, for instance, something suitable for a Macaw, would be great for a Vasa Parrot. At a minimum, a Vasa Parrot should be house in a cage that is at least 36 inches wide by 24 inches deep by 36 inches tall. Include a nesting box large enough for your Vasa Parrot (available at bird specialty stores, pet-supply stores or online) and plenty of perches of various sizes. Because Vasa Parrots love to sun bathe, situate your cage so half is in the sun and half is in the shade.</p><p>Vasa Parrots are busy and inquisitive birds. Set up a play gym with lots of toys to keep your Vasa Parrot's mind and body active and entertained. Foraging activities are a big hit with Vasa Parrots, as are interactive toys, puzzle toys, mechanical toys, chewable toys, and baby toys and rattles, and anything else your Vasa Parrot can investigate and manipulate. Vasa Parrots love to bathe and will jump around and play in the water, so offer frequent bathing opportunities. Vasa Parrots also like to take baths.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Although relatively heathy, Vasa Parrots might be prone to developing Psittacine beak and feather disease, which is a viral disease affecting certain parrots and other birds.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Vasa Parrots are famous for their voracious appetites. These birds will eat enormous amounts of food. Offer a varied diet that includes a high-quality pelleted diet, high-quality seed mix, and plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables like bananas, mangos, berries, peaches, pomegranates, peppers, carrots, sprouts, green beans, peas, and sweet potatoes.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Even if you have a large enclosure as is recommended for these parrots, your Vasa Parrot should be out of its enclosure as much as possible to allow for stretching its wings, flying and generally moving around and playing. Vasa Parrots are extremely active birds and will exercise themselves appropriately if given ample opportunity.</p><p>Friendly and affectionate</p><p>Active and entertaining pets</p><p>Enjoys handling and play</p><p>Needs a lot of attention and interaction</p><p>Needs a large enclosure/space to fly</p><p>Rare/hard to find</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Vasa Parrot </h2><p>The Vasa Parrot is rare, although some may be available for salein pet stores and bird specialty stores. You can also purchase Vasa Parrot from a breeder. As with all bird species, be sure to do adequate research to ensure the breeder you're looking to buy from is experienced and sells healthy birds raised in a humane environment. If you are interested in adopting a Vasa Parrot, bird rescue groups and even your local animal shelter might have Vasa Parrots available for adoption, although the chances of finding an available rare species like the Vasa Parrot may be slim.</p>",951

These birds bond strongly with their keepers and have a reputation for being one-person birds. Because they require so much attention, experienced bird owners who are familiar with keeping large parrots are a better match for these birds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Major Mitchell's cockatoo,Leadbeater's cockatoo,pink cockatoo, desert cockatoo, wee juggler, cocklerina, chockalott</p><p>Adult Size: 13 to 15 inches in length</p><p>Life Expectancy: 40 to 60 years in the wild; up to 80 years in captivity</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Major Mitchell's cockatoo is native to inland Australia. These birds nest in pairs in woodlands and treeless areas, always near water. They can become nomadic during dry periods. They tend not to nest near other pairs, which means they require a large territory. However, they do often hang around galah cockatoos, another Australian native. The wild population of Major Mitchell's cockatoos are dwindling due to human development of their native habitat.</p><p>Named for Major Sir Thomas Mitchell, an explorer and surveyor of Australia and admirer of the species, the Major Mitchell's cockatoo's scientific name commemorates ornithologist Benjamin Leadbeater. Leadbeater was a London-based natural history merchant who supplied specimens to the British Museum.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>A high-maintenance species, this bird requires dailysocializationand interaction with its owner to maintain good emotional health. This species has a natural tendency to form a tightly-knit bond for life. As its keeper, you will become its bonded mate. This bird is funny and energetic, as well as cuddly and affectionate.</p><p>Major Mitchell's can be temperamental. This bird is sensitive to the absence of its bonded human. Your bird might even shun you after taking a short vacation. It can take some time to earn back the bird's trust. Neglected cockatoos may resort to destructive behaviors, such as self-mutilation, chewing on wires, and destroying furniture.</p><p>Since they tend to bond with one person, Major Mitchell's cockatoos can show signs of jealousy when their owners interact with other people. They may try to nip or bite the other people to show their irritation. This is a significant reason why this bird is not a good pet for families with small children.</p><p>These birds are brilliant and can be taught tricks like dancing or playing hide and seek. Some learn to speak, or can at least whistle to get their owner's attention. They can hit some pretty high notes and have a natural alarm call intended to be heard for miles in the wild.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>In general, cockatoos can be loud and incessant talkers. The Major Mitchell's species is noticeably quieter and more prone to natural calls. They can be taught to say a few basic words and can mimic whistles or alarms. Their natural calls are not too loud; they make exotic chirps and high pitched alarm calls. Thus, they probably aren't suited to live in apartments or other close quarters with nearby neighbors.</p><h2>Major Mitchell's Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>The Major Mitchell's species is the only cockatoo to have a multi-colored crest. When extended, you'll seebright pink and yellow-orange feathers with white at the tips.</p><p>The colorful Major Mitchell's cockatoo is primarily pinkish-white and very easy to recognize. These flashy birds have broad pink patches around the neck and on the underbelly. They often havebold pink under their white-tipped wings.</p><p>The males tend to be brighter than the females, though the females have more orange in their crest. While males have brown eyes, females usually have reddish-pink eyes. Both sexes have gray feet and horn-colored beaks.</p><h2>Caring for Major Mitchell's Cockatoo </h2><p>While it can be tempting to rush out and buy one of these beautiful birds, Major Mitchell's cockatoos need specialized care and environments that not all bird owners can accommodate. It is best if they live in a walk-in cage (5 feet high) that is at least 4 feet long. This allows the large bird plenty of room to move.</p><p>These birds are moderately strong chewers and can break welds on poorly constructed cages. Many can open cage latches, so locks or escape-proof latches may be necessary.</p><p>Routine bathing or showering is vital to maintaining good plumage and skin. Birds can be misted and allowed to dry in a warm room or in the sun. Do not clip the wing feathers excessively. Clip only the primary flight feathers and only enough so the bird will glide to the floor.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>In general, this species is a long-lived, hardy cockatoo. It is a sensitive bird. If the cockatoo perceives its bonded human is neglecting it, it is prone to depression. This may cause it to self-mutilate and feather-pluck, which can cause a skin infection.</p><p>If this bird acquires sarcocystis, a parasitic muscle tumor, it is fatal. Major Mitchell's are susceptible to several avian diseases like psittacine beak and feather disease, bacterial infections, fungal infections, and metal toxicity.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, this cockatoo eats mainly seeds from melons, weeds, and pine trees; cereal grains; and insect larvae.</p><p>Like all cockatoos, Major Mitchell's are prone to obesity. When young, cockatoos are notoriously picky eaters and don't seem to need much food to maintain themselves. As they age, however, they tend to put on weight. Monitor its fat intake.</p><p>High-quality pellets, a moderate amount of seed mix, and daily helpings of fresh, thoroughly washed bird-safe fruits and vegetables are the ideal diet for these birds. They tend to enjoy green leafy vegetables like lettuce, spinach, and Swiss chard as well as carrots, celery, corn, green beans, and zucchini. Many also enjoy nuts, including hazelnuts, peanuts, pecans, and walnuts.</p><p>Feed approximately 1/4 cup of formulated diet and 1/4 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily. If the bird consumes all of its food, add small amounts as desired. Treats such as seeds, nuts, and table foods may be given in small quantities, especially as rewards for good behavior.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Just like its fellow members of the parrot family, Major Mitchell's cockatoos are active birds that need plenty of exercise to maintain their physical condition. They need a minimum of three to four hours outside of the cage every day to stretch their wings.</p><p>Provide your Major Mitchell's cockatoo with safe chew toys to exercise their beaks. These birds chew wood to make nests in the wildand will display that same behavior in captivity if they get bored or restless.</p><p>Regularly give your bird untreated elder, fir, pine, or willow wood pieces or toys. Leather toys and even heat-sterilized pine cones are other good options. Since these cockatoos appreciate water play, a watering bowl or spray-misting will be appreciated by your pet and fulfills some of its activity requirements.</p><p>Unique-looking species</p><p>Intelligent</p><p>Playful and loving personality</p><p>Can get jealous</p><p>Can get loud and noisy</p><p>Requires hours of daily exercise</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Major Mitchell's Cockatoo </h2><p>Major Mitchell's cockatoos are usually sold by breeders and can be found at rescues or through adoption agencies. They can cost $4,000 to $10,000, depending on the temperament of the bird, its age, and if the bird is hand-raised.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, ask the breeder long they have been breeding and working with the species. If you can, tour their facility. Look forsigns of good overall health of the flock. The birds should be active and alert with bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1210
2,https://www.thesprucepets.com/mealy-amazon-parrots-390257,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>Mealy Amazon Parrot: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Mealy Amazon Parrot: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>Known by many as the gentle giant of Amazon parrots, the mealy Amazon is a docile, easy-to-train bird that can be an excellent pet.These beautiful, large birds may not have the flashy colors of other parrots, but their loving, friendly personality makes up for that. They are the right choice for bird owners who want a large parrot but would prefer one with a laid-back attitude.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Mealy Amazon, mealy parrot, blue-crowned mealy parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 15 to 17 inches in length, weighing 1 to 2 pounds, sometimes more</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can live to 60 to 70 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The mealy Amazon is native to Central America and South America. Their range extends from southern Mexico to parts of Bolivia, Brazil, Peru, and Colombia. The birds call the woodlands and tropical rainforests of these areas home. Although, as farmers encroach on their habitat, they ravage farm fields as an easy source of food. Farmers consider Amazons to be pests.</p><p>This parrot lives in large flocks that can reach over 100 birds, though mating pairs will fly off to find a tree cavity to nest in for the breeding season.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Mealy Amazons are known to be the most gentle and docile of the Amazon parrots. They are affectionate when kept as pets and form strong bonds with their owners. This behavior stems from their instinct to create a monogamous, lifetime pairing with their mate.</p><p>Similarly, they love to interact with their human flock. Many owners say that the bird will simply wander around looking for someone who can give them attention. When they find that family member, they'll wait patiently to be picked up or played with.</p><p>Amazon parrots need social interaction to remain healthy and happy. Neglected birds can develop destructive behavior patterns anddepression, which can manifest in various physical and emotional problems. These problems include biting and feather plucking.</p><p>Generally, they are not an aggressive bird. They're called ""non-nippy Amazons"" because they don't usually nip or bite. They tend to get along with other birds as well. However, many go through a hormonal bluffing stage during adolescence. Bluffing may cause aggressive tendencies that some owners can't handle. While the phase does pass, it can sometimes last for up to two years. For this reason, they are best suited for experienced bird owners.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These birds are excellent talkers and can pick up a diverse vocabulary. It's quite comical to listen to them repeat phrases using different inflections every time.</p><p>When it comes to vocalizations, mealy Amazons are large, so their screams can be deafening and carry a long distance. Yet, they will not yell out as much as some feistier parrots.</p><h2>Mealy Amazon Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Mealy Amazons are mostly green with darker shades toward the top of the body changing to a lighter lime green toward the tail. They are distinct from other parrots because of a grey-green pattern along the nape of the neck and back. It looks as if the bird was dusted with flour, which is how it gets the ""mealy"" name.</p><p>The species' other common name, blue-crowned parrot, is due to a blue patch that's on its crown. On some birds, this may be more of a purple color and some have a patch of yellow on their forehead.</p><p>These birds also have bursts of red and blue on the edges of their feathers and flesh-colored legs. Their beaks range from horn- or yellow-colored to dark gray, and they have a featherless white ring around the eyes.</p><h2>Caring for Mealy Amazon Parrots </h2><p>Overall, if you learn your bird's personality and work on forming a solid bond, a mealy Amazon can become a well-trained pet. Just be sure you can fully commit to its needs and can afford the costs associated with keeping a large parrot.</p><p>As this species is large, this bird will need a substantially sized cage. At a minimum, your bird should have a cage that is 3 feet wide and long and at least 5 or 6 feet tall. Amazon parrots are prone to excess weight gain, so they must be allowed room to exercise every day.</p><p>Routine bathing or misting with a shower head is vital to maintaining good plumage and skin. Allow the birds to dry in a warm room or in the sun, or gently dry the bird with a warm blow-dryer.</p><p>Do not clip the wing feathers excessively as heavy-bodied mealy Amazons often fall and injure themselves. You can trim the primary flight feathers to the point where the bird can glide to the floor.</p><p>Mealy Amazon owners need to set aside a period of time each day for one-on-one interaction with their bird. Not only does it help the bird remain tame, but it alsoestablishes and maintains a healthy bond. Mostly, the bird just wants to be near you. This clinginess makes training easy; they love to sit on shoulders so they can be part of the action.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Like all Amazon parrots, mealy Amazons do best on a high-quality pelleted diet, supplemented with daily servings of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Feed approximately 1/3 to 1/2 cup of pelleted food and 1/3 to 1/2 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily.A raw and varied diet will help ensure that your bird maintains top nutrition.</p><p>Give seeds and nuts as an occasional treat. Although they are a bird's favorite, they are loaded with fat and can lead to obesity if your bird becomes a picky eater and only wants seeds.</p><p>Never feed avocado, chocolate, rhubarb, alcohol, or coffee beans; these foods are toxic for your bird.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>You should be able to offer a minimum of three to four hours of supervised, outside-of-cage time per day. This activity will allow the bird to burn excess calories and stretch its muscles on top of providing essential mental stimulation.</p><p>The bird's cage should also allow room to move and explore with ladders, a perch, and other enticing elements. Providing bird-safe toys is going to keep the bird occupied while inside. Rotate toys to prevent boredom and, since they do like to chew on things, gives the bird an outlet other than your furniture to take care of that instinct.</p><p>Social, affectionate, loyal</p><p>Intelligent, great talker and can perform tricks</p><p>Least nippy of the Amazon species</p><p>Can get loud when it wants to</p><p>One of the largest Amazons and requires a large cage</p><p>Needs at least 3 to 4 hours of socialization, exercise daily</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mealy Amazon </h2><p>If you think a mealy Amazon might be the right bird for you, contact localbreedersto see if you can schedule a visit to meettheir birds. Observing the behavior ofmealy Amazons in their home environment will help you decide whether or not this species is the right choice for your lifestyle.</p><p>Before purchasing a mealy Amazon from a bird store or breeder, check animal shelters and rescue organizations. They can cost from $1,000 to $2,000 from a breeder.</p><p>If buying through a breeder, make sure you interview the breeder, look at the general health of their birds, check out their living conditions, and talk to past customers. Signs you should avoid the breeder include cramped living conditions, inactive birds, and breeders who avoid your questions or do not seem to have much information on their birds.</p>",1207

A sweet-natured species, umbrella cockatoos can be overly affectionatebordering on obsessivewith their caretakers. These birds may require more attention and care than many other species, but they make up for it with their comical charm. Just as with any bird, however, prospective owners should be sure that they can meet the needs of an umbrella cockatoo before acquiring one.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Umbrella cockatoo, white cockatoo, white-crested cockatoo</p><p>Adult Size: 18 to 24 inches in length</p><p>Life Expectancy: 70 or 80 years or more in captivity with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos are native to the tropics ofIndonesia. These birds originally hail fromthe Maluku Islands in the central and northern parts of the archipelago. They are now commonly found throughout all Indonesia.</p><p>You can find these birds in forests, mangroves, swamps, and open woodlands. They enjoy living along rivers and the edges of clearings and farmland, which provide a bounty of food. Due to the transition of their native lands to farmland, the birds pick at crops and farmers consider them a nuisance. The umbrella cockatoo species population is declining due to a loss of its habitat, hunters, and trappers. Vulnerable to endangerment, umbrella cockatoos are now a protected species.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos are gentle, docile, and sweet-tempered by nature, making them well-suited to be companion birds. In the wild, umbrella cockatoos mate for life. They form a very close bond with their mate, possibly more than other species of cockatoos. They will join small flocks of umbrella cockatoos and are rarely apart from their mate. If a mated pair is separated, it is not uncommon for each of the birds to become genuinely depressed.</p><p>Rarely aggressive, they will quickly form strong bonds with their caretakers. These affectionate birds love to cuddle with their person, bird, or even object of choice. Equally loving and devoted owners are a good match for these parrots. This species begs to be spoiled, so plan on at least one to two hours of training, attention,and enrichment per day.</p><p>Umbrellas are very social and intelligent. They are capable of learning and performing a wide variety of tricks. Easily trainable, they are often featured as the star of bird shows. Short, daily training sessions yield the best results. To prevent your bird from becoming bored, have an arsenal ofsafe bird toysat your disposal. This species is not known for its mimicry of human speech, but it does screech loudly to vocalize its displeasure or excitement.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>While the occasional cockatoo can imitate human speech, in general, these birds are not good talkers or imitators of sound. They have a loud, grating screech or scream and may hiss when alarmed. In the wild, their loud vocalizations were used for communication and could carry over long distances.</p><p>In captivity, they often use loud squawks to call for attention. For this reason, umbrella cockatoos may not be the best choice for those who live in apartments or condosor anyone with close neighbors.</p><h2>Umbrella Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos are primarily white with a pure white crest. When courting a mate, agitated, excited, scared, or even just frustrated, its crest will raise into an impressive umbrella-like fan. It can also be a peculiar way to express curiosity at something new and, quite often, is a warning that the bird wants to be left alone. It's also a good warning sign that the bird may bite if approached.</p><p>The underside of their wing and tail feathers are a pale yellow color that looks beautiful when in flight.</p><p>Although the coloring of males and females is mostly the same, males are distinctly larger. Males have broader heads and larger beaks. Umbrella cockatoos have black beaks and gray or black feet. Some exhibit a tinge of light blue in the rings around their eyes. The irises of males are usually dark brown, appearing nearly black. A mature female usually has reddish-brown irises.</p><h2>Caring for the Umbrella Cockatoo </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos are large birds that need a large cage and play area. Get an enclosure that is as large as possible, since these birds do not enjoy containment. This species may act out or become very unhappy in a tight space, which can lead to self-mutilation or illness.</p><p>Diurnal birds, umbrella cockatoos require uninterrupted sleepevery night for 10 to 12 hours. Good sleep is essential for maintaining their health and wellbeing.</p><p>Cockatoos have a powdery down. Bathe the bird regularly to reduce this naturally emitted dusty substance.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos may pick at or pull out their feathers if they get depressed or need mental stimulation. They are prone to psittacine beak and feather disease, which is a deadly virus. Also, if they are fed diets that are too high in fat, they can acquire fatty liver disease and become obese.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Like all large parrots, umbrella cockatoos are big eaters. In the wild, they spend most of the day looking for food. Seeds, nuts, coconuts, and grain in farmer's fields are standard favorites in their diet.</p><p>As a pet, about 80 percent of their diet should be a formulated pelleted diet. The rest of their food should consist of a wide variety ofvegetables, including leafy greens and root vegetables. High-quality grains such as quinoa and other ancient grains, fresh sprouts, and fresh fruit are great dietary choices for this species. Fresh water should be available at all times.</p><p>On occasion, feed them healthy nuts such as almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, and walnuts. You can also offer healthy seeds like hemp, milk thistle, or flaxseed as treats.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos are active birds. Like all parrots, they need to spend at least two hours out of their cage each day for play and exercise. Provide your bird several chewable bird toys to exercise the bird's powerful beak. Rotate the toys occasionally to prevent boredom. Toys are helpful for exercise, as well as stimulationand enrichment. You can teach your cockatoo to play games like catch on the floor with a whiffle ball. Structured playtime is essential for bonding and allowing the bird to stretch their muscles.</p><p>To encourage and increase activity within the enclosure, add plenty of ladders and swings. These are enriching additions to the environment that will allow your cockatoo to move about and burn off energy in a positive way.</p><p>Social and affectionate</p><p>Intelligent</p><p>Can be trained to do tricks and play</p><p>Can be loud</p><p>Can be dependent on owners</p><p>Need a lot of space</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Umbrella Cockatoo </h2><p>Umbrella cockatoos are one of the most common types of cockatoos owned in the U.S. Since these parrots' needs tend to be demanding, rescue organizations are full of unwanted cockatoos. It is not unusual for an umbrella cockatoo to go to its second home by the time it is 3 years old.To rescue one, contact the Center for Avian Rescue, Adoption, and Education, which maintains a directory of reputable bird rescues throughout the U.S.</p><p>Pricing from a breeder can range from $1,000 to $4,000.

4,https://www.thesprucepets.com/double-yellow-headed-amazon-parrots-390253,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>Double Yellow-Headed Amazon Parrot: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Double Yellow-Headed Amazon Parrot: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>This medium-sized parrot with the lengthy name is one of the most popular pet species of the Amazon parrot group, thanks to its striking color and its unsurpassed mimicry ability. The double yellow-headed Amazon parrot can even learn to mimic opera singing, which may be why it has been a popular pet for centuries.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Double yellow-headed Amazon parrot, yellow-headed parrot, yellow-headed Amazon</p><p>Adult Size: From 14 to 16 inches, one of the larger parrot varieties</p><p>Life Expectancy: 60 years old on average; some can live 80 years or more under ideal conditions</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Native to Mexico and Central and South America, this parrot's natural habitat is forests and woods near water. Habitat destruction and trapping for the pet trade have severely compromised the numbers of the double yellow-headed Amazon parrot in the wild; only a few thousand wild birds remain.</p><p>The International Union of Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources classifies this bird as an endangered species. International treaties now make it illegal to capture, export, or own wild-caught birds. Captive-bred birds can be legally sold and owned, though documentation is required.</p><p>A few introduced wild groups of double yellow-headed Amazon parrots live in diverse locations, including Stuttgart, Germany, and several locations in southern California.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>When hand-fed from a young age, these birds can be affectionate pets. They're intelligent, have remarkable ""speaking"" ability, and they love to be the center of attention. However, problems may occur when an owner is unwilling or unable to give the parrot the attention it demands.</p><p>Like many parrots, double yellow-headed Amazons may go through a hormonalbluffingstage as they approach sexual maturity (age 4 months to 1 year). They can become aggressive and may lunge andbiteat peopleduring this phase. The bluffing behavior can last for several months (and sometimes up to two years). If you have small children who will be interacting with the bird, it may be better to choose a different species if you plan to get a young or adolescent parrot.</p><p>The double yellow-headed Amazon tends to bond with one designated family member. You can avoid this by making sure that multiple family members handle the bird regularly, especially when it is young. Hand-feeding by all family members will reduce the bird's tendency to bond with only one person.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>This species is the bestmimic of all the Amazon parrots and is second only to the African gray parrot in its ability to learn words and phrases.</p><p>It is also a noisy, boisterous bird, prone to screaming sessions twice a day, at dawn and dusk. These loud vocalizations are normal for this species.

However, their charming, endearing personalities and excellent talking ability make them one of the better cockatoo options. Also, they are not as loud as other parrots. They are a popular pet in their native Australia and are becoming better known in other parts of the world.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Slender-billed cockatoo, long-billed cockatoo, slender-billed corella, long-billed corella</p><p>Scientific Name: </p><p>Adult Size: 18 and 20 inches, weighing about 1.5 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 50 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The slender-billed cockatoo calls southeastern Australia home. They prefer woodlands and open fields and often travel in sizeable flocks estimated to be more than 1,000 birds.</p><p>During the mating season, pairs will go off to build a nest near water in eucalyptus trees or rocky cliffs. The couple mates for life. If one goes missing or dies, the other experiences great sadness.</p><p>Farmers in Australia consider slender-billed cockatoos a nuisance since these massive flocks can destroy a season's crops. Farmers have retaliated by poisoning some of these birds. Urban flocks are more prevalent near Perth and Sydney. This population growth stems from the release of unwanted pet birds.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Compared to other cockatoos, the slender-billed is a great pet bird. These intelligent birds are friendly and outgoing. Their antics will keep you entertained for hours.</p><p>While slender-bill cockatoos are incredibly affectionate and sensitive, they're also one of the more independent cockatoos. That does not mean they don't crave attention, they still do. However, these cockatoos are not as needy as other cockatoo species.</p><p>In the wild, they're used to being monogamous. Similarly, they are one-person birds. After forming a bond with you, it lasts forever.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Of the cockatoos, this species is the best talker; it can learn complete, clear sentences and mimic words and whole sentences to near perfection. On the flip side, they are also considered a ""quiet"" parrot and do not scream as loudly or as often as most.</p><h2>Slender-Billed Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>The slender-billed cockatoo is a stocky bird with a somewhat comical appearance. Its grayish-white beak is very long and slender. Unlike many other cockatoos, this species does not have a prominent crest. It is very short, and, when not fanned out, you will hardly be able to see it. It is almost hard to tell that the bird is a cockatoo.</p><p>This bird's feathers are mostly white with a salmon-pink cast. It has patches of bright pink just above the beak and on the neck, giving its face both a mask and a collar. They also have a baby blue eye-ring. The feathers on its wings and short tail are white with pale yellow undersides that are most visible in flight. They have gray legs.</p><p>This bird is monomorphic, meaning that genetic or surgical sexing is the only way to tell males from females. If you look closely, however, you may notice that a mature female (at least 5 years old) has a brown iris while a male has a black iris.</p><h2>Caring for Slender-Billed Cockatoos </h2><p>Slender-billed cockatoos are affectionate pets. These birds crave interaction with their ownersand require daily handling and socialization to maintain their emotional health.</p><p>Slender-billed cockatoos that feel neglected will sometimes resort to destructive behavior. For the bird's well-being, do not bring one home if you will not be able to spend at least three hours a day with it.</p><p>They are large birds and require a large cage. To keep a slender-billed cockatoo comfortable, the minimum cage size should be at least three-foot square, but larger is always better. You should also invest in a moveable parrot play stand that can follow you. These birds love to spend time near their owners. The stand keeps the bird busy while keeping the bird close to you.</p><p>Around the time that the bird reaches sexual maturity (around ages 3 to 5), male slender-billed cockatoos may go through an aggressive stage called bluffing, which is typical among parrots. Handle this temperamental period of biting, hissing, or insolence with a dose of patience and reinforce the training you have established. If you have young children, this parrot may not be the right choice if you have a slender-billed cockatoo that has not reached maturity yet.</p><p>Cockatoos naturally produce a powdery down that helps keep their feathers clean. This dust will coat the surfaces near the bird and can trigger allergies for those who are sensitive to dust or animal dander.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Cockatoos of all species are prone to most of the same health issues. Any pet bird that feels neglected or lacks exercise may startfeather pluckingand destructive chewing. To avoid these unwanted behaviors, provide your pet with plenty of toys and attention.</p><p>Like other parrots, slender-billed cockatoos are prone to obesity and fatty tumors if their diet does not include enough fresh vegetables and fruit. This species is also susceptible topsittacine beakand feather disease (PBFD), a viral condition.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, the slender-billed cockatoo uses its long, slender beak for digging up roots, seeds, and bulbs, especially from the weedonion grass.</p><p>Like all cockatoos, slender-billed cockatoos are prone to obesity, so owners should monitor their fat intake. Avoid feeding large quantities of high-fat seeds such as sunflower and safflower. Never feed birds avocados or chocolate; these foods are toxic to them.</p><p>A healthy diet should consist of high-quality pellets, a moderate amount of seed mix, and daily helpings of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables. To start, offer approximately 1/3 cup of formulated diet and 1/3 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily. If the bird consumes all of its food, incrementally add small amounts as desired. Do not overfeed.</p><p>Overfeeding can leads to selective eating and wasteful throwing of food. Adult and juvenile birds are picky eaters.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Slender-billed cockatoos need a minimum of three to four hours outside of the cage each day to stretch their muscles and play. This activity helps the bird maintains peak mental and physical health.</p><p>These cockatoos are naturally curious and like to chew on wooden furniture and electric wiresa potentially fatal hazard. Train your birds to stay at their play stand and closely supervise the bird when it is out of the cage.</p><p>To encourage good chewing habits, have a ready supply of bird-appropriate toys for them to chew, grasp, and climb. Expect to replace the toys regularly. Also, rotate the toys in and out as the bird loses interest in an item.</p><p>Social, affectionate, likes handling</p><p>Intelligent, one of the best talking cockatoos</p><p>Quietest of the cockatoos</p><p>Not as needy as other cockatoo species</p><p>Requires at least 3 to 4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time</p><p>Emits powdery dust that can aggravate allergies</p><p>Head crest not as noticeable as most other cockatoos</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Slender-Billed Cockatoo </h2><p>Contact slender-billed cockatoobreedersto see if you can spend some time with their birds. Talking to someone experienced in keeping these cockatoos will help you decide if they are a good match for your home.</p><p>Ask breeders how long they have been breeding and tour their facility. Make sure that the bird you take home is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p><p>The price ranges from $3,000 to $4,000 for hand-tame babies or adults that need a new home.</p>",1210

Like other Amazon parrot species, it dwells principally in rainforests.</p><p>An exotic find in the pet trade, the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species lists the Panama Amazon as an endangered species. Although trapping is outlawed, loss of habitat and illegal trapping has significantly reduced wild populations of this bird.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Panama Amazons are social, entertaining birds that have become increasingly popular as pets in recent years. Their high intelligence, coupled with their playful nature, makes them well-suited as pets for families and active households. They are highly talented talkers that can get noisy when the mood strikes.</p><p>Their social nature helps to make them gentle and affectionate companions. While this is a loving bird, this is also a very active species, so this bird needs an owner that can keep up with it. It must havea safe space to climb and play outside of the cage each day.</p><p>Like all Amazon parrots, Panama Amazons may go through a temporary aggressive stageduring its adolescence. This bird needs the guidance of an experienced parrot handler to navigate through this challenging period.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Prized for its great talking ability, it is a quick learner that can easily mimic sounds and become an excellent talker.Like most Amazons, they tend to get very noisy for about 10 minutes at sunrise and again at sundown. This clock alarm-like instinct has carried over from its days living in the wild as an avian timekeeper.</p><h2>Panama Amazon Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Panama Amazons are mostly green with a bright yellow triangular patch on their foreheads. They have a spot of red on the tops of their wings,flesh-coloredfeet, and horn-colored beaks. The eye is orange, surrounded by an unfeathered white ring.</p><p>Their markings often lead people to confuse them with the popularyellow-naped Amazon parrot. The differences are subtle. ThePanama Amazonis a bit smaller, a darker shadeofgreen, and it lacks the reddish-orange spot on the upper part of the beak that the yellow-naped has.</p><h2>Caring for the Panama Amazon Parrot </h2><p>This bird, although not large, needs a roomy cage.

For owners unable to provide a lot of daily interaction, you might want to get another bird to keep it company.</p><p>While hand-fed Amazon parrots usually make loving, affectionate pets, many go through bluffing, an aggressive, biting stage as it approaches sexual maturity (at age 4 to 5)that some owners can't handle. While the phase does pass, it can last for two weeks or two years. Potential owners should remember that if they adopt a Panama Amazon, they are making a lifelong commitment. These birds can live more than 60 years if properly cared for, so keeping one is not a decision to be taken lightly.</p><p>As a rainforest bird, it relishes its frequent showers or baths. Bath time can be an opportunity for good interaction with your bird, and some owners take the bird into the bathroom shower with them each morning.More commonly, you can shower your bird several times each week using a sink sprayer; this is a gratifying experience for your Panama Amazon parrot.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The Panama Amazon is a remarkably healthy bird when adequately cared for, but it can also develop common health problems found in other Amazon parrots.</p><p>The birds are prone to fungal diseases such as aspergillosis. To prevent this disease from affecting your bird, remove any old wood shavings or other materials that can harbor mold. Also, Amazons are susceptible to bacterial infections. Symptoms include runny fecal droppings and respiratory problems like difficulty breathing. These infections can be treatable; however, aspergillosis is often fatal.</p><p>If the bird does not get a balanced diet or eat enough fruit and vegetables, your bird can get a vitamin A deficiency, fatty liver syndrome, or cancerous fatty tumors.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In thewild, thePanama Amazoneats berries, other fruits, plants, seeds, and nuts.Like all Amazon parrots, Panama Amazons do best on ahigh-qualitypelleted diet supplemented with seed mix and daily servings of freshbird-safe fruits and vegetables. A fresh and varied diet will help ensure that your bird maintains top nutrition.</p><p>Specially formulated pellets are an ideal food and should ideally represent approximately 75 to 80 percent of the bird's diet. Fruits, vegetables, and greens should account for about 20 to 25 percent of the daily diet. Seeds and nuts are high-fat foods that you can offer as occasional treats. Start by giving your bird 3/4 cup of pellet-based parrot mix and a 1/2 cup of fruits and vegetables daily, then adjust according to their appetite.</p><p>Panama Amazons enjoy eating with the family. You can share a wide range of nutritious human food with the bird, although do not let it overeat.

It lives in virtually the same territory as the blue-and-gold macaw.</p><p>Green-wing macaws have been kept in captivity as far back as the 17th century. Captive breeding programs took off during the 19thcenturyand were quite successful. Today, it is relatively easy to find green-wing macaws bred in captivity.Like many other tropical birds, this macaw's natural habitat has been badly depleted, and many are still captured for the black market parrot trade.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Green-wingmacawsare tame and affectionate with a usually even, easy-going disposition.

And, like larger cockatoos, they require several hours of mental stimulation and physical interaction.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Goffin's cockatoo, Tanimbar corella</p><p>Adult Size: One of the smallest cockatoo species, between 12 and 13 inches long, about the same size as a cockatiel</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 to 40 years with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The natural habitat for the Goffin's cockatoo is the Tanimbar Islands of Indonesia. Their habitat includes the tropical forests of Larat, Selaru, and Yamdena in the Maluku province. They can be found in New Guinea as well.</p><p>A loss of habitat and trapping for the pet trade has left this species threatened in the wild; they are a protected species. To keep one as a pet, you need a permit from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The permit certifies that the bird was captive-bred and not an illegally trapped wild animal.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Goffin's cockatoos have a reputation for being very social and affectionate. They are playful, curious, and active birds. They may be one of the smaller cockatoos, but they have a big bird personality and are quite fun-loving and gregarious.</p><p>These birds are brilliant, which leads them to mischievous, menacing behaviors. After watching you a few times, they can learn how to open the latch on their cage. You can expect to have a crafty escape artist on your hands.</p><p>A scientific studyput Goffin's to the test and found them to have extraordinary problem-solving skills when it came to mechanics. Ten birds were tested on various interlocking devices, and most figured out the puzzles after just one failed attempt. Some required a demonstration from humans, while another bird figured it out on its own.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Compared to many parrots, the Goffin's are relatively quiet. However, they will still scream when they want your attention. These birds are not the best talkers, but with enough training, you can teach them to say a few words.

This species likes to chew and can destroy a cage, so make sure that the one you choose is tough (preferably wrought iron).</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Neglected Goffin's cockatoos will not thrive. They will resort to destructive behaviors like feather plucking or skin picking if they do not get the interaction they need. Birds that self-mutilate can easily contract bacterial, viral, and fungal infections.</p><p>Other diseases that are common in cockatoos include psittacine beak and feather disease (a virus), as well as fatty liver disease and obesity. Weight-related conditions can occur if the bird eats a diet high in fat and does not get enough exercise.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, this bird eats seeds, fruits, nuts, berries, blossoms, roots, leaf buds, and an occasional insect. With the disappearance of their natural habitat, they have learned to forage from farmer's grain crops.</p><p>In captivity, all cockatoos, including Goffin's, are prone to excessive weight gain. Owners need to monitor fat intake. A high-quality, formulated pellet should make up 75 percent of their nutrition. A wide variety of healthy, raw vegetables, grains, greens, fruits, and, occasionally, nuts are supplemental (25 percent).</p><p>Feed approximately 3/4 cup of formulated diet and 1/4 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily. If the bird consumes all of its food, add small amounts as desired. For a treat, consider offering sprouted seeds as a healthy alternative to dried seeds; dried seeds are high in fat.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Goffin's cockatoos are active birds that need plenty of activity to stay healthy. Owners should give their birds a minimum of three to four supervised hours outside of the cage each dayto play and stretch their muscles. Out-of-cage time also gives these birds a sense of independence.</p><p>Time outside the cage is ideal for training. Be consistent, so your bird remains tame and well adjusted to life in your home. Get a play stand for out-of-cage time; it is a perfect accessory for this. Birds will use it like a personal gymnasium, where they can play with toys, climb up and down, grab treats, and eat snacks. The toys and treats will keep your bird occupied and stimulated.</p><p>Get interactive toys to ensure that your birds get the exercise they need to stay in good physical and mental condition. Give your bird puzzles like knots to untie and things they can take apart. Chew toys allow these birds to use their natural inclination to bite on something. Tap into their foraging instinct by hiding toys or treats for the bird to find.</p><p>Social, friendly, not as loud as other cockatoos</p><p>Can dance and learn to say a few words</p><p>Smaller cockatoo, does not need a cage as large as the bigger species</p><p>Can get loud and scream when it wants attention</p><p>Requires at least 3 to 4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time</p><p>So smart, it can escape its cage</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Goffin's Cockatoo </h2><p>Before you bring a Goffin's cockatoo home, contact localbreedersand see if you can spend some time with them and their birds. Experienced keepers can help you decide if these birds are theright birdfor you. Learn as much as you can about the bird's history. You can expect to pay $1,000 to $3,000 for a Goffin's cockatoo.</p><p>Use caution if you adopt a Goffin's cockatoo from a rescue; many rescue birds were neglected and their self-destructive behaviors can take a lot of hard work to recover from.</p>",1181

Extremely intelligent and enormously fond of humans, this pretty pink bird can readily learn to say many words and do complicated tricks with regular training. This hardy bird can live in some of the more extreme areas of Australia.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Rose-breasted cockatoo, galah, galah cockatoo, pink and gray cockatoo, crimson-breasted cockatoo, roseate cockatoo, galah parrot</p><p>Scientific Name: with three subspecies with slight color and size variations from different regions in Australia: (southeastern), (western), and (northern)</p><p>Adult Size: 12 to 15 inches in length, weighing 10 to 14 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can live to 70 years in captivity; most commonly will live 40 or so years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The galah is native to Australia, where it can be found in open grasslands and over much of the country. It has self-established in Tasmania. Galah cockatoos travel in large flocks, often in groups that also include sulfur-crested cockatoos. They will mate with other species of cockatoos.</p><p>Galahs are a familiar sight in urban areas.These birds tend to be more prevalent in settled areas because they eat cultivated crops and make use of artificial ponds and livestock watering troughs. Many farmers regard the birds as pests.</p><p>The name ""galah"" means ""fool"" or ""clown"" in the native Australian language Yuwaalaraay. This highly intelligent bird got the name for being a loud nuisance. The term ""galah"" is a slang, derogatory word in Australia that means a ""loud-mouthed idiot.""</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Affectionate and friendly, the galah cockatoo has a reputation for being a loving pet. Unlike umbrella cockatoos, these birds are not big on cuddling. But, they are accustomed to handling.</p><p>If you are interested in owning a galah, make sure that you have plenty of free time to spend with your pet. It is a sensitive bird, requiring a lot of attention and interaction from its owners. As a flock-dwelling bird by nature, if its adopted human flockmate ignores it, the rose-breasted cockatoo can become depressed, angry, and destructive.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Wild galahs emit loud, high-pitched sounds while flying in flocks. They can make a resonating screech when frightened, excited, or calling out for attention. This clever bird can imitate people's voices and repetitive sounds like train whistles, car horns, or telephone ringtones. Some say males are more prolific talkers than females.</p><p>Comparatively, the galah cockatoo is not particularly loud for a cockatoo, which is among the loudest of parrots. Still, this bird is not recommended for apartment or condo living. It usually has two noisy periods, once upon waking with the sun and at dusk.</p><h2>Galah Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>Their bold colors and friendly personalities have made galah cockatoos increasingly popular as pets. As its descriptive name suggests, rose-breasted cockatoos have bright pink feathers on their chests, bellies, and the lower half of their faces. They have pinkish-white crests and gray backs, wings, and tail feathers, gray feet, and horn-colored beaks. As is true of all cockatoos, the galah has a head crest that fans out when the bird is frightened or excited.</p><p>The easiest way to attempt to determine the sex of a galah is to look at its eyes. Males have a darker, almost brown iris (area of the eye that surrounds the pupil) while the females have a lighter, pink iris. Anecdotally, males may talk more, and females tend to sit on a perch with their legs farther apart.</p><h2>Caring for a Galah Cockatoo </h2><p>Your bird will want to spend a considerable amount of time with you and will be a reasonably high-maintenance pet. If you are short on time for interaction, this bird might be happier housed with another galah.</p><p>These parrots need sound sleep in a dark, quiet place that mimics the safety of the roosting areas that they prefer when living in the wild. Covering the bird's cage at night usually reassures them.</p><p>This bird is not a large parrot but still requires plenty of space. At the very least, it needs a 5-foot-square cage.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Galahs seem to be less prone to avian diseases than other cockatoos. However, they are just as susceptible to nutritional disorders as other parrots and cockatoos. Some of the most common conditions include fatty liver disease, lipomas (fatty tumors), psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), feather-picking, and other forms of self-mutilation (if they feel neglected).</p><p>By far, the most common problem with galah cockatoos is obesity. This is nearly always caused by too little activity, combined with a diet that has too many calories. With sufficient exercise and abalanced diet, your galah should remain at a healthy weight.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, galahs eat grasses, leaf buds, flowers, seeds, and on occasion, insects for extra protein.</p><p>When kept as pets, feed galahs a balanced diet. High-quality formulated pellets have been developed to meet all your bird's nutritional needs. At least 50 percent of your bird's diet should be in pellet form. The other half of their diet should be fruits and vegetables. Start by feeding 1/4 cup of pellets and 1/4 cup of fresh salad daily. Incrementally increase as needed.</p><p>Great choices for fresh vegetables include leafy greens such as Swiss chard, kale, Chinese cabbage, and romaine; root vegetables; peppers; zucchini; green beans; and sprouts. They love most fruits and berries. Give walnuts, almonds, and pecans sparingly as training treats. Fresh water should be available at all times.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Galah cockatoos are active birds, and they need plenty ofexercise to maintain their physical health.

In captivity, this playful, friendly bird tends to form close bonds with a single person. This Amazon is favored by bird enthusiasts for its size, personality, colorful plumage, and great talking abilityalong with its relative affordability.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: White-fronted Amazon parrot, white-browed Amazon parrot, spectacled amazon parrot</p><p>Scientific Name: subsp.there are two other subspecies: the lesser white-fronted Amazon ( subsp. ), and the Sonora white-fronted Amazon parrot (subsp. )</p><p>Adult Size: A smaller Amazon species, white-fronted Amazons typically reach only about 10 inches in length.</p><p>Life Expectancy: 50-plus years in captivity</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>White-fronted Amazon parrots' native range extends from Mexico to western Costa Rica, as well as Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Puerto Rico. Their preferred habitat is brushy grasslands and tropical deciduous forests. They may live in pairs or small flocks of 20 to 30 birds.</p><p>The bird was first described and categorized in 1788 by Swedish naturalist Anders Sparrman. Its numbers are prolific in the wild.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Beautiful and intelligent, a white-fronted Amazon parrot can be a delightful pet for the owner it bonds to. Although it may be shy around others, its love of interactive play with its owner can be a delight for others to witness.</p><p>White-fronted Amazons are not well suited as pets for families with children but may be great for a single owner. They bond strongly with their owners, but some tend to become ""one-person birds."" It is best to socialize them at a young age, or they may become reclusive and testy as they get older. They are a good choice for owners who have plenty of spare time to spend with their bird.</p><p>Like many Amazon species, some white-fronted Amazons some may go through a hormonalbluffing stageas they reach maturity. While hand-fed Amazon parrots typically make loving, affectionate pets, the bluffing stage may turn birds aggressive during adolescence (age 4 months to 1 year), and some owners can't handle it. While the phase does pass, it can sometimes last up to 2 years. For this reason, this bird is best suited for those who have experience keeping medium- to large-sized birds.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>In addition to being a great mimic and talker, the white-fronted Amazon parrot has a variety of vocalizations: squealing, barking sounds, loud, harsh trills and notes, and other short, sharp noises. Since it is a noisy bird, it is not suited for apartment or condominium living with close neighbors.</p><h2>White-Fronted Amazon Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>White-frontedAmazons are primarily green with patches of white and blue on their foreheads. They have bright red rings around their eyes, which has led many to call them ""spectacled Amazons."" They have sparse patches of light blue on their chests and bellies, and their wings have deep blue and rededges. There is a brilliant red blaze on the underside of the tail feathers, and they have beige-colored legs and light gray beaks.</p><p>The lesser white-fronted is slightly smaller and darker in color, while the Sonora white-fronted has more greenish-blue on top of the head.</p><p>Unlike most other Amazon parrots, you can visually distinguish between males and females of this species. The female lacks the red edge on its wings.</p><h2>Caring for White-Fronted Amazon Parrots </h2><p>Amazon parrots thrive on social interaction, and they need it to remain healthy and happy. Neglected birds often fall into destructive behavior patterns anddepression, which can manifest itself in various physical and emotional problems.</p><p>Set aside time each day for one-on-one interaction with the bird, which will establish and maintain a healthy bond.</p><p>Potential owners should remember that if they adopt a white-fronted Amazon, they are making a long-term commitment. These birds can live more than 60 years if properly cared for, so caring for one is not a commitment to be taken lightly.</p><p>Make sure your white-fronted Amazon parrot has a roomy cage. Most experts recommend a cage with at least a 2-foot by 3-foot footprint and a height of 3 to 5 feet. The cage should have ample play equipment inside, including climbing apparatus like ropes and ladders; these are acrobatic birds.</p><p>This is a hardy bird that can do well in protected outdoor aviaries.White-fronted Amazons tolerate a wide range of temperatures, but make sure to keep your bird protected from drafts. Bathe your parrot regularly with warm water to keep their feathers moist and clean.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>White-fronted Amazon parrots can be prone to intestinal infections while they are acclimating to a new environment but are quite hardy after that.Some common illnesses they are susceptible to include:</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, white-fronted parrots eat mostly fruits, berries, plants, seeds and nuts, corn, and some protein.</p><p>Like all Amazon parrots, white-fronted Amazons kept as pets do best on ahigh-qualitypelleted diet, supplemented with seed mix and daily servings of freshbird-safe fruits and vegetables. Feed approximately 1/3 to 1/2 cup of pelleted food and 1/3 to 1/2 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily.A raw and varied diet will help ensure that your bird maintains top nutrition.</p><p>As with all parrots, avocado, chocolate, rhubarb, coffee beans, and alcohol are toxic to this bird.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Amazon parrots are prone to excessive weight gain, so they must be allowed room to exercise every day. If you want a white-fronted Amazon, you should be able to give it a minimum of 3 to 4 hours outside of its cage per day. This activity will allow the bird to burn off excess calories and stretch its wings and muscles, as well as to provide it with essential mental stimulation.</p><p>These birds are also intensechewers and will need plenty of toys to chew on and play with. Even providing the bird with branches and twigs may help channel the chewing instinct and save your furniture from damage.</p><p>Social, affectionate, loyal</p><p>Intelligent, a great mimic and talker</p><p>Smallest Amazon, requires slightly smaller cage than larger Amazons</p><p>Can get loud when it wants to; not recommended for apartment living</p><p>May have biting, aggressive period during its adolescence; not recommended for families with young children</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a White-Fronted Amazon Parrot </h2><p>Before purchasing a white-fronted Amazon from a bird store or breeders, check animal shelters and rescue organizations. They can cost from $1,000 to $3,000 from a breeder.</p><p>If buying through a breeder, make sure you interview them, look at the general health of their birds, check out their living conditions, and talk to past customers. Signs you should avoid the breeder include cramped living conditions, inactive birds, and breeders who avoid your questions or do not seem to have much information on their birds.</p>",1113

Some say that the African grey parrot was kept as a pet for thousands of yearsthere are records of these birds as household pets in biblical times.</p><p>This parrot is characterized by its grey feathers and an uncanny talent for accurately mimicking words and phrases. It can also understand human speech, which has helped to catapult this bird to stardom in researchcircles and the pet trade.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Grey parrot,African grey parrot, Congo grey parrot,Congo African grey parrot</p><p>Adult Size: Measuring about 13 inches, weighing just under 1 pound</p><p>Life Expectancy: On average, 40 to 60 years in captivity</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The African grey parrot is native to the equatorial regions of Africa, including the nations of Angola, Cameroon, Congo, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Kenya, and Uganda. The species' favored habitat is dense forests, but it is also frequently found at the edges of forests and in open savanna areas.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>African greys are the most intelligent of the parrot species. Many grow to be extremely sweet and affectionate toward their owners, and the species is known for being quite sociable.</p><p>However, an African grey that is bored or neglected isan unhappy bird. A depressed or angry bird will screech its discontent. You must provide the bird with lots of mental stimulation.</p><p>A highly intelligent bird is also a complex bird. Although it is very social and demands interaction, it is not necessarily a cuddly bird. Some of these birds tend to become ""one-person"" birds, even if owners make every effort to socialize them with all members of the family.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Pet African greys pick up on words and sounds very quickly. One African grey has even ""blown the whistle"" on a woman's love affair by repeatedly calling out the other man's name in front of her husband and using the cheating wife's voice.</p><p>Like toddler children, African grey parrots have a reputation for repeating everything they hear. So, it's wise to watch your language around these birds. Greys are adept at picking up and repeating any sounds they like, including squeaky doors, vehicle back-up chimes, fire alarms, microwave alert bells, and telephone ringtones. Owners need to be vigilant about what these birds hearonce a sound is learned, it is difficult or impossible for the bird to ""unlearn"" it.</p><p>The African grey is not known as a loud screamer. It can be suitable for owners living in apartments or condos, although neglected birds may scream their dissent for being ignored and can get noisy.</p><h2>African Grey Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>The African grey, true to its name, sports mostly grey feathers, some with a beautifully thin, pale edging. There are two subspecies, Congo and Timneh greys. Congos are about a third larger than Timnehs.Congo African greys boast shiny black beaks and bright red tail feathers, while Tinmeh greys have horn-colored mandibles and deep maroon tailfeathers.</p><p>You can tell males and females apart once the birds reach adolescence, at least 18 months of age. A male African grey's tail will remain solid red, while a female's red tail feathers become tipped with silver. The undersides of a male's wings become dark, while a female's remain light. Other subtle sex differences include: a male will have a more slender, narrower head, while females tend to have longer necks, with larger, rounder heads. If these differences are too subtle for you, you can get a definitive answer with a surgical sexing procedure or a DNA test.</p><h2>Caring for an African Grey Parrot </h2><p>The African grey is a medium- to large-sized parrot that needs adequate living space. Minimum cage size should have a 2-foot by 2-foot footprint and 3 feet in height. Larger cages are preferable.</p><p>Without plenty of interaction and training, an African grey parrot may become depressed and exhibit self-mutilating behaviors, such as feather-plucking.</p><p>These birds thrive when they have lots of opportunities for playing with toys, interacting with their owners, and learning words and tricks. Expect to spend several hours each day interacting with and training your African grey. Many owners report that African greys enjoy having television or radio playing when they are left alone.</p><p>African greys are said to be somewhat sensitive and easily affected by stress and commotion. They may be more relaxed if the cage is placed in a quiet corner of the room rather than in the center.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>African greys can be prone to feather picking, calcium deficiency, vitamin-A and vitamin-D deficiency, respiratory infection, psittacosis, and psittacine beak and feather disease.</p><p>Vitamin deficiencies can be prevented by making sure your bird eats a wide selectionof fruits, as well as vegetables high in beta-carotene, such as cooked sweet potato, and fresh kale.</p><p>Feather-picking is usually the sign of a bored bird that is not receiving enough mental stimulation, attention, or exercise.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In thewild,African greys eatfruits, leaves, insects, bark, and flowers. The best food for an African grey in captivity is a high-quality, formulated pellet supplemented with fruits such as pomegranate, organic mango, and melon. Also, provide fresh vegetables, includingleafy greenslike arugula, watercress, kale, sprouts, and healthy seeds such as hemp and flaxseed.You can premake chop, a salad for birds, that will help keep your African grey parrot healthy and thriving.</p><p>Many greys also enjoy a variety of treats and snacks, such as nuts and healthy table foods like steamed green beans,breakfast toast,and salad.</p><p>Offer you bird a half cup of pellet-based parrot mix and a 1/4 cup of fruits and vegetables daily and adjust the quantity according to their appetite. Remove and discard all uneaten fresh food by the end of each day.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Adequate amounts of activity are crucial to maintaining the health of an African grey parrot. Pet greys should be allowed to spend at least 1 to 2 hours out of their cages daily with vigorous exercise and make sure to provide them with plenty of bird-safe chew toys to help exercise their powerful beaks.</p><p>Social, friendly, although do not like being cuddled</p><p>Intelligent, can speak and understand hundreds of words and phrases</p><p>Requires a lot of attention and mental stimulation</p><p>Tend to be one-person birds not the greatest family pet</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an African Grey Parrot </h2><p>Contact a local breeder and see if you can meet with them and their pets to see first-hand how these birds interact in a home environment.</p><p>Breeders sell African greys in the range of $2,000 to $4,000. Signs you should avoid the breeder include cramped living conditions, inactive birds, and breeders who avoid your questions or do not seem to have much information on their birds.</p>",1107

They have large solid swatches of red, blue, and yellow feathers. This flashy, gutsy bird is full of energy and has a big personality. This large parrot easily makes the list of most popular parrots every year.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Scarlet macaw</p><p>Scientific Name(s): with two subspecies: (Central America) and (South America)</p><p>Adult Size: 35 inches long, weighing 2 to 3 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 80 years or more, though 40 to 50 years is more typical</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Scarlet macawsare native to the tropical rainforest areas of Central and South America. Its preferred habitat is humid evergreen forests at elevations from about 1,000 to 3,000 feet. In the wild, it dwells mostly in the canopy and topmost layers of the trees.</p><p>This species has an extensive natural range, but it is threatened in many areas due to deforestation and illegal trapping for the pet trade. The scarlet macaw is on the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) Appendix 1 list. The commercial trade of these wild birds is forbidden, which means the import of these birds to the U.S. is illegal.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>The scarlet's striking plumage may be what initially draws your attention, but its personality keeps you enthralled. Scarlet macawsare intelligent birds with an abundance of energy and character.</p><p>Scarlet macaws that have been hand-raised or hand-trained can be very affectionate. They make great companions with a sweet disposition.</p><p>In the wild, scarlet macaws live in small flocks. If you keep this bird as a lone pet, you become its flockmate and can form a strong bond. To keep this bird as a tame housemate, you will need to be attentive and interact with it every day. If not properly trained and socialized, it can become aggressive and destructive.</p><p>Scarlet macaws are idiosyncratic birds that may become fixated on one person. To avoid this behavior, train them from an early age to socialize with every family member.</p><p>This bird's impressively large beak is powerful. If provoked, it can bite. This bird may not be a great fit for families with children who are too young to understand bird warning signs or boundaries.</p><p>Scarlets, like allmacaws, are noisy at times. They can learn how to talk, although its blue and gold macaw cousin is known to be the more prolific talker.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Confident and friendly, scarlets are usually eager to learn tricks and develop a vocabularyof 5 to 10 words. Scarlets can get extremely loud which may make them a questionable choice for those living in apartments or condominiums.If you are sensitive to loud noises, you might want to think about getting another bird species.</p><h2>Scarlet Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Scarlets are mostly vivid red with bright yellow and blue edging on their wings. Some birds may have a band of green where the yellow meets the blue. The large eye patch is white, and the bill has a horn-colored upper mandible and a black lower mandible.There is no obvious way to tell apart the males from females; to figure this out, the bird needs genetic or surgical sexing.</p><h2>Caring for the Scarlet Macaw </h2><p>Macaws are the largest of the parrots. A scarlet macaw is best suited for a large space and will not thrive in a cage that is too small. Get a cage that is at least 2 1/2 feet by 3 feet. It needs a lot of out-of-cage time, and if it doesn't get it, the bird may develop behavioral problems. It will resort to feather-plucking and other forms of self-mutilation. They can get bored quite easily, so provide them with large swings and toys.</p><p>Once a week, offer your macaw a bath or hose down your bird with lukewarm water using the fine-mist setting of your handheld shower sprayer.</p><p>To prevent your bird from flying through an open window or door, trim its primary wing feathers.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Scarlet macaws, like other large parrots, are prone to self-mutilation and feather plucking when they are bored or neglected.</p><p>These birds are susceptible to a variety of nutritional disorders and diseases, such as macaw wasting syndrome (proventricular dilation disease), parrot fever (psittacosis), and psittacine beak and feather disease (viral infection).</p><p>Overgrown beaks are also sometimes a problem; this can be prevented if you provide hard chewable toys and rough surfaces for the macaws to trim their beaks.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Nuts, leaves, berries, and seeds from the rainforest make up the bulk of thescarlet macaw'sdiet. Its strong, hooked beak is perfect for breaking nuts and seeds.</p><p>The best diet for a macaw in captivity begins with a formulated parrot mix that includes a variety of seeds, dried fruits, and nuts. Provide a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables daily, as well as high-calcium greens like kale and spinach. An all-seed diet is extremely unhealthy for these birds. Never offer chocolate and avocado, which are toxic.</p><p>The average healthy macaw will consume approximately 10 to 15 percent of its body weight daily. An average bird weighs about 2 pounds. You can expect a bird will eat about 1/2 cup of food per day, which equates to about 100 pounds of food per year. Feed them in the morning upon waking. Remove any uneaten chop or freshly cut fruits and vegetables after an hour.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Macaws arelarge birdsand need ample space and time to play and stretch their muscles. These are active birds by nature. These birds need the means to burn off energy. A scarlet macaw should be allowed outside of the cage for at least two hours a day; five hours is optimal.</p><p>Rotate a varied supply of chew toys to help it exercise its powerful beak and jaws. Rugged toys that can take a beating help the jaw muscles while providing an outlet for the chewing instinct.</p><p>A play gym or a parrot cargo net that allows your macaw to play and climb can be a great activity to help your bird meet its exercise requirements.</p><p>Beautiful and intelligent</p><p>Can talk and mimic human sounds</p><p>Long-lived</p><p>Tendency for loud squawks and screams</p><p>Requires at 2 to 5 hours of daily exercise, mental stimulation</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Scarlet Macaw </h2><p>Scarlet macaws are usually sold only at avian specialty pet stores or by breeders. They can cost $2,000 to $4,000. The price range is dependent on the breeder, if it was hand-raised, and its vibrancy.</p><p>Rescues or adoption agencies may get this bird given up by owners unable to care for them.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, ask the breeder long they have been breeding and working with the species. Tour their facility. When perusing their inventory, look forsigns of good overall health of the flock. The birds should be active and alert with bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1125

Like many Amazons, however, yellow-naped Amazons go through a hormonalbluffingstage as they approach sexual maturity (age 4 months to 1 year).While the phase does pass, it can sometimes last for up to two years.</p><p>During their bluffing stage, yellow-naped Amazons may bite and show other aggressive behaviors. It's more apparent in the males, and some birds act out more than others. Because of this, you may want to consider a female parrot. In general, a young or adolescent Amazon is not the best bird for families with children.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These parrots may not screech as much as some, but they will get very loud on occasion. They are excellent talkers and singers, however. You can train these birds to develop a rather extensive vocabulary of words spoken with great human-like clarity, but be careful what you say. They're also known for picking up (and relentlessly remembering) some phrases you'd prefer the bird forget.</p><h2>Yellow-Naped Amazon Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Yellow-naped Amazons are mostly a bright green color.

Bad habits, past trauma, and inadequate training can result in a parrot that even the best bird behaviorists will have difficulty rehabilitating.</p><p>Potential owners should remember that if they adopt a yellow-naped Amazon, they are taking on the care of a creature that is every bit as intelligent and emotional as a human toddler. Due to their very long lifespan, caring for one is not a commitment to be taken lightly.</p><p>Make sure you provide a cage that is suited to this birdat least 3 square feet. The bird may seem small, but it still needs room to move and play.

It is common to see at a zoo or aviary. Although this is a gentle bird, it is not a bird for novices. Even pigeon fanciers and experienced bird owners need to ensure they have the dedicated space and time required by these majestic creatures.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Victoria crowned pigeon</p><p>Adult Size: 28 to 30 inches from head to tail; nearly as large as an adult female turkey, they weighing about half as much, roughly 7 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 25 years in captivity with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Originally from New Guinea and introduced to nearby islands, the Victoria crowned pigeonhas been bred in captivity for hundreds of years. They're a common sight in the United States and the United Kingdom at zoos and aviaries, though they are somewhat rare in the pet bird trade.</p><p>This bird is the largest living pigeon and the closest remaining relative to the extinct dodo bird. It was named in honor of Queen Victoria for its flashy blue crown of intricate lace-like patterns and its regal poise.</p><p>In the tropical rainforests of New Guinea, Victoria crowned pigeons were hunted for their meat and feathers. Due to hunting and habitat destruction, the wild population had declined rapidly, endangering the species to near extinction. As a protected species, it has improved from being a ""threatened"" and ""vulnerable"" species to ""near threatened."" Deforestation of its natural habitat still occurs.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Victoria crowned pigeons are known to be intelligent and quite easy to tame. This bird is docile by nature, which is why they're a frequent attraction at zoos. They are often left to roam the grounds freely and tend to be happiest when foraging for food on the ground and wandering around.</p><p>This bird can fly short distances but will only fly when necessary, usually when startled, in danger, or in need of a high roost in the trees for the night.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>The call of this pigeon is unlike breeds you may be used to. It is not a soothing, cooing pigeon. Victoria crowned pigeons let out more of a hollow ""boom"" sound that can be quite loud and surprising.</p><h2>Victoria Crowned Pigeon Colors and Markings </h2><p>A stunning bird, Victoria crowned pigeons sport powdery blue feathers on their bodies with red eyes, a dark mask, and maroon breasts. They display a lighter shade of blue on their wings and in a band on their tailfeathers.</p><p>The crest looks like a beautiful display of dark blue lace with vivid white tips. This crown makes them seem more like a peacock than a pigeon.</p><p>This bird is a monomorphic species, meaning males and females look alike. A male may be slightly larger than a female, but it's barely noticeable. To figure out the sex of your bird, it would require a surgical sexing procedure or a genetic test.</p><h2>Caring for Victoria Crowned Pigeons </h2><p>Victoria crowned pigeons spend quite a bit of time on the ground and need plenty of room to run around and exercise. They need a minimum of 200 square feet of ground space in their enclosures. They also need roosts at various heights.</p><p>These space requirements can be hard for even the most dedicated enthusiast to meet. In other words, if you can't provide your bird with a flight the same size as the average bedroom, then you should not consider adoptinga Victoria crowned pigeon.</p><p>These pigeons tend to do best as a pair in a single flight enclosure; a solo bird may become too lonely. During the breeding season, males may fight each other. The males have an elaborate courtship dance. Generally, a mating pair will only produce a maximum of three eggs each year. Both the male and female incubate the eggs, which takes around a month to hatch and raise the young squabs.</p><p>Despite their docile personality, this is not a low maintenance bird. Since they are foragers, clean the enclosure regularly, so they don't get health issues from eating their droppings along with their food.</p><p>Keep in mind that the birds are native to a tropical climate and will do best in warm, humid regions. They cannot tolerate temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. If your region gets cold, you'll need to figure out how to provide heat.

These spores can cause potentially fatal respiratory diseases, such as histoplasmosis and candidiasis.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Like all pigeons, Victoria crowned pigeons feed on the ground. In the wild, their diet consists mainly of fallen fruits, seeds, grains, and small invertebrates. They're particularly fond of figs.</p><p>Captive crowned pigeons do well on a high-quality seed and grain mix, and many keepers stick with a standard dove mix. They should also get regular servings of fresh fruits and vegetables. Offer about a 1 cup of seed mix and 1 cup of fruits and vegetables per dayadjust the daily portion according to their appetite. This species is not known for overeating. Remove any uneaten fresh food at the end of each day to prevent spoilage.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like most pigeons, these birds need plenty of room to exercise, stretch their muscles, and play. They will entertain themselves and stroll around the enclosure foraging. You canencourage this habit by strategically placing their food around the enclosure and offering them an exciting variety of foods and hidden treats.</p><p>Gentle, docile disposition</p><p>Can get along and live with other bird species</p><p>Requires large aviary or room-sized enclosure</p><p>Needs to live with at least one other bird</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Victoria Crowned Pigeon </h2><p>While these pigeons may be more obscure than other bird species, there are a few aviaries left in the U.S. thatbreedand offer them for private sale. If you can provide for the bird's needs and have your heart set on one, keep looking. The chances are that you will find one eventually. Be prepared to pay a hefty price because a pair can easily run a few thousand dollars.</p><p>Make sure that the bird you want to take home is healthy.

In some parts of Australia, this bird is so plentiful that people consider it a nuisance. The Wild Bird Conservation Act prohibits the import of sulphur-crested cockatoos to the United States, so most pet birds now are captive-bred.</p><p>The lesser sulphur-crested cockatoo looks similar to the (greater) sulphur-crested cockatoo, occupies a different geographic range, and is not a typical pet bird.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Cockatoos are an affectionate species among the various types of parrots; the sulphur-crested is typical in this regard. You must be willing to devote the time and energy toform a strong bond with a bird.

Their primary range is from eastern Mexico to Ecuador, though there are a few flocks in central Brazil.</p><p>They enjoy nesting in tree cavities of the tropical forests and tend to live in small flocks. In some areas, human development and trapping for the pet trade have endangered these Amazons.</p><p>This species was first noted in 1758 by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus, creator of the modern taxonomy system. There are a few subspecies of the red-lored Amazon parrot, which look the same with differences in size.</p><h3>How to Select the Right Pet Bird for You</h3><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Red-lored Amazons are intelligent, charismatic birds that like to be with their owners as well as other birds. They bond quickly with human family members and will become a loyal part of the family.</p><p>These birds are very talented talkers and singers.

Any fresh foods or mashes that you place in your Amazon's cage should be taken away when feeding time is over to avoid bacterial growth.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Amazons are active parrots. They should be allowed ample time outside their cage to play and stretch their wings. These birds love to climb and chew. Provide Amazon parrots with plenty of toys, including ladders to climb, ropes, and swings to perch on.</p><p>These birds require sturdy toys to clutch and chew. Chewing on wooden and leather toys is an outlet for their instinct of digging for grubs in rotting wood as well as pulling on bark strips to eat or expanding a nest hole.

Senegals can be strong chewers, so it's a good idea to provide them with toys to exercise their beaks.</p><p>""Sennies,"" as they are affectionately referred to by many owners, bond strongly with their owners and thrive on daily interaction with them. Those interested in owning a Senegal should be willing to make time forhandling and socializationwith the bird every day. Interaction time is rarely a burden since these birds are often content to sit on your shoulder.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The main health concernfor a Senegal and otherparrots is , a commonfungal disease in birds. Keep the cage clean and providea balanced diet to reduce the likelihood of this infection. Also, be sure there is adequte ventilation, especially in warm, humid climates.</p><p>Bornavirus is another infectious condition that can strike Senegal parrots. Watch for weight loss and poor digestion. This disease is usually transmitted from infected birdsand can be present for many years before symptoms develop. There is no treatment for this disease. Owners should be careful about allowing Senegal parrots to come into contact with other birds until carefully quarantined.</p><p>Senegals can become overweight, especially if they primarily eat seeds and not enough fresh fruit and vegetables.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, the Senegal parrot eats mostly fruit, seeds, and blossoms. Senegals kept as pets should eat a varied diet consisting of fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy seeds such as flax, hemp and chia seed, tree nuts, and a high-quality formulated pelleted diet. In general, feed Senegals eat 1/4 cup of food per day. Provide a seed/pellet formulated mix every morning. Give as much as the bird will eat. Supplement pellet food with fruits and vegetables.</p><p>Consider making chop, which is a freshly frozen diet that you can learn to make. It's an easy and convenient method of providing your Senegal with a wide variety of vegetables, grains, and vegetable protein.</p><p>As with any companion bird, provide fresh water in a clean bowl daily. Avoid giving an all-seed diet; this menu is extremely unhealthy and can lead to illness or even death from nutritional deficiency.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>ASenegal parrot should get at least 1 hour a day of outside-of-cage time on a play stand or another bird-safe area. Provide toys like small foot toys, bells, balls, chewable leather, and wood toys. These items will entertain your Senegal while away from its enclosure. They love to climb and can be quite the little acrobats. These birds will appreciate a variety of swings, ladders, and other toys to explore.</p><p>Social, friendly, and appreciate handling</p><p>Intelligent, can say a few words</p><p>Quieter bird, noise level should be suitable for close neighbors</p><p> </p><p>Requires a lot of attention and mental stimulation</p><p>Tend to be one-person birds not the greatest family pet</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Senegal Parrot </h2><p>If you think a Senegal parrot might be the right bird for you, connect with an adoption and education foundation or parrot rescue and try to set an appointment to visit one. You may find an excellent match with a bird that needs a home. Although the Senegal parrot is an easygoing pet that is less likely to be given up for adoption, some birds do lose their homes due to unforeseen circumstances. On average, breeders sell Senegal parrots from $800 to $1,500.</p><p>Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. Avoid a bird that is sitting quietly with puffed feathers; it might be ill. The bird's feathers should be smooth and shiny and lay down flat on the body. The feathers around the vent/cloaca (opening where bird expels feces and urine) should be clean, dry, and free of fecal matter. The scales on the feet should be smooth. Make sure Its nails are in good condition, and Its beak is smooth and well-shaped. Its nostrils should be clear and clean.</p>",1185

Its flashy colors make it highly attractive for prospective parrot owners. However, it is often its comical personality, intelligence, and the ability to respond to training that seals the deal.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Catalina macaw, rainbow macaw</p><p>Scientific Name: Hybrid x </p><p>Adult Size: 35 inches, weighing 2 to 3 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 50 to 60 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>This breed was formed bycrossing a blue and gold macawwith a scarlet macaw. Catalina macaws are found mainly in captivity. You seldom find a naturally bred Catalina macaw in the wild.</p><p>In bird breeding and hybridization, the father's genes are most often dominant. Catalina macaws most often look like scarlet macaws, since the male is usually a scarlet.</p><p>The Catalina is considered a first-generation macaw hybrid. It was derived from two naturally occurring or ""true"" birds. Since this is such a beautiful bird, some breeders use it for breeding a number of second-generation hybrid macaws (those from at least one hybrid bird). It is also rather common to find second-generation Catalinas that are a cross between two Catalina parents.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Owners of hybrid macaws get the best of both worlds from their parent species. Scarlet macaws are known to be curious, feisty, and extremely active. In contrast, blue and gold macaws have a reputation for being more laid-back and gentle; they're also great talkers. Those with Catalina macaws describe their birds as being a perfect mix between the two.</p><p>Every birdno matter the specieswill have a unique personality that will reflect its upbringing. Catalinas can be cranky with very demanding social needs or extremely affectionate and charming with fun times ahead for its adopted family. Some Catalina macaws will become one-person birds. They may even prefer men or women exclusively, shunning people of the opposite sex.</p><p>The bird is likely to be social and accepting of people if it is introduced to a variety of people when you first bring it home. This species can make a good family pet as long as the children are not too young. Teach the bird and the children to respect one another from the start.</p><p>Highly intelligent, Catalina macaws respond well to training and can be taught to perform several tricks and to talk.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Many Catalina macaws can attain a vocabulary of around 15 words and phrases over their lifetime. They can get loud and scream when excited, agitated, bored, or just to let you know the sun is up. This pet is not likely a suitable candidate if you have close neighbors, such as in an apartment building.</p><h2>Catalina Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>In general, hybrid macaws are bred primarily for their color traits. The Catalina macaw has a wide range of colors and patterns.There are slight differences from one generation to the next as well.</p><p>Most of these birds are primarily red or deep orange on their chests and bellies. Some have brilliant red-orange heads while others have a gorgeous blue-green crown. They tend to have green and blue feathers running down their backs and long tails. Many of them have gold feathers edging their wings and their tails.</p><p>The Catalina looks similar to the harlequin macaw. The two hybrids are often mistaken for one another. The most significant difference is the Catalina usually has the long, tapering tail of the scarlet.</p><p>There is no noticeable difference between male and female Catalina macaws. To tell them apart, you will need a DNA test, chromosomal test, or surgical sexing procedure. The DNA test is the most noninvasive option.</p><h2>Caring for the Catalina Macaw </h2><p>Being social birds, they must spend adequate time bonding with their owners to become happy, well-adjusted pets. If you are looking to adopt a Catalina macaw, make sure that you have at least 2 to 4 hours to spend with your bird every day. These parrots thrive on interaction and will become depressed and destructive if neglected or ignored.</p><p>As with all large parrots, these birds need a large cage that is no less than 4 feet wide and long by 5 feet high. The more space you can provide, the better off your bird will be. Give the bird plenty of perches and toys to keep it engaged.</p><p>Potential owners should think seriously about macaw ownership. Are you willing to be awakened early every morning by a screaming parrot? Can you accommodate the several hours of socialization and exercise every day? Also, consider the costs of owning a pet macaw. Veterinary bills, high-quality feed, toys, and cages all add up. If you can't provide your bird with the best of everything, think about waiting to adopt one until you can. The more that you spoil a parrot, the better your pet ownership experience will be.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The health care concerns for Catalina macaws are the same as other macaw species.</p><p>Birds that are bored, have a poor diet, want a mating partner, or need a bath might resort to feather picking or plucking. Remedy this self-mutilating behavior by addressing their needs immediately.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, macaws eat a variety of seeds, plants, fruits, and nuts. Like any large parrot, feed a Catalina macaw a diet that includes a high-quality seed and pellet mix, along with fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Each macaw, depending on its size, will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables every day. You can feed it once in the morning upon waking and at dusk before it goes to sleep.</p><p>Fruits that are good to feed to macaws include apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangos, papayas, and berries. Healthy vegetables include carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, and leafy greens. Never feed avocado; it is toxic to birds. As a treat, offer nuts like macadamias, walnuts, pecans, almonds, and filberts.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Catalina macaws need plenty of activity to maintain top mental and physical condition. If you are interested in owning a Catalina macaw, you will need to supervise your bird for a minimum of 2 to 4 hours per day as it plays outside of its cage. This out-of-cage time is crucial to prevent boredom and allow the bird to stretch its wings and other muscles properly.</p><p>Provide toys to enrich your bird's activity time. Playthings can include climbing ropes, chains, bells, parrot swings, and wooden bird toys that they can clutch and chew. Destructible toys are fun for birds since they are interactive; the bird usually sets a goal to defeat the toy. Non-destructible toys will last longer, but macaws can get bored with them.</p><p>Beautiful and intelligent</p><p>Can talk and mimic human sounds</p><p>Long-lived</p><p>Tendency for loud squawks and screams</p><p>Requires at 2 to 4 hours of daily exercise, mental stimulation</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Catalina Macaw </h2><p>Contact a parrot adoption and education agency and ask if you can visit their birds. Seeing one of these parrots in its home environment will give you a feel for what it's like to live with one. Breeders sell Catalina macaws in the range of $3,000 to $5,000.</p>",1192

This green bird with the bright blue head and spiked tail is a gentle, clever, playful creature that can make a great pet. This kind of parrot has even starred in two movies: ""Pauly""and the documentary ""The Parrots of Telegraph Hill.""</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Blue-crowned conure, blue-crown conure, blue-hooded conure, blue-capped conure,blue-crowned parakeet, sharp-tailed conure</p><p>Scientific Name: There are five subspecies with varying color combinations:</p><p>Adult Size: 14 to 16 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 30 years with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Blue-crowned conures are native to South America with a range that extends from eastern Colombia to northern Argentina. Their preferred habitat includes savannah-like grasslands, woodlands, and forest margins. You will not find it in dense, humid forests.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Blue-crowned conures are known for being intelligent birds full of playful energy. Like all parrots and conures, in particular, the blue-crowned conure needs a lot of mental stimulation and exercise to prevent it from becoming bored and restless.</p><p>These birds are very affectionate, social creatures. They bond strongly with the owner who treats them well and gives them the attention they crave. Blue-crowned conures rarely bite, which makes them a suitable pet for families with children.</p><p>Highly trainable, you can teach conures to retrieve items, turn around, and wave. The best strategy for successful training is ignoring bad behavior and rewarding good behavior with attention and treats.</p><p>However, there is no training that will turn this naturally noisy bird into a quiet one. If upset or excited, it can scream and shriek, which is not a good situation for apartment living. Attempts to scold the bird when it screams will only make it louder.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Blue-crowned conures are a bit quieter than other conure species, but no conure is a quiet bird. This species will be quite noisy in the morning and evening, which can create problems with close neighbors.</p><p>In general, conures do not talk as much as other types of parrots. However, the blue-crowned conure ranks as one of the better conure talkers. They are capable of learning several words and short phrases.</p><h2>Blue-crowned Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>Males and females are identical in color and pattern. When born, the blue-crowned conure has a reddish head. It changes to bright blue by the time it reaches maturity. In addition to its signature parakeet green body and blue head, blue-crowned conures have reddish tips on their tail feathers, pink legs and feet, horn-colored beaks, and white rings around their eyes.</p><p>To tell a male apart from a female, use a genetic test. The physical difference is hardly noticeable, if at all. Males may have larger white eyepatches than females, and the feathers of their ceres (above their nostrils) tend to be longer.</p><h2>Caring for the Blue-Crowned Conure </h2><p>This is not a bird you should plan to leave confined to a cage all of the time. The blue-crowned conure is a highly social bird that spends its time in a flock when in the wild. In captivity, you will need to serve the function of its flock mate.</p><p>If you are not around much during the day, a blue-crowned conure may be happier when it has another bird as a companion. It may also be happier if you leave a television or radio playing when the bird alone in the house.</p><p>Conures are unique parrots in that they like to snuggle under things, such as a tightly woven washcloth, a soft piece of fabric, or a small blanket. It might even want a bird tent as a place to sleep.</p><p>In the wild, conures bathe daily. In captivity, they need a bath at least weekly, and more often if possible. Frequent bathing will keep the feathers and skin healthy. Wet your bird under a spray mist of lukewarm water; it counts as interaction time with your pet.</p><h2>Common Health Issues </h2><p>All conures can be prone to feather picking, which usually occurs because they are getting insufficient attention and stimulation. Spend time talking to your bird, train it tricks or learn to speak, and provide a rotating crop of toys to prevent your bird from getting bored.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, blue-crowned conures typically feast on a varied diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, and grains.</p><p>Conures in captivity need an equally varied diet consisting offresh fruits, vegetable greens,and high-quality pellets. Pellets should be about 75 percent of their diet. Offer about a 1/4 cup of pellets a day and watchhow much yourparrot consumes. Offer more if necessary.Most conures eat about 20 percent of their body weight. Pet conures fed a high-fat diet of only seeds and nuts often have health issues.</p><p>Offer fresh foods once or twice a day. Give them as much as they will eat. Remove the uneaten foods after the feeding period. Early morning is usually the most active meal time; these diurnal birds are generally hungry after a long night's rest. You can also try feeding again right before dusk. Birds in the wild naturally forage for a final meal before they tuck in for the night.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>As is the case with many birds, chocolate and avocado are toxic to conures.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Blue-crowned conures have a naturally high energy level. They prefer being out of the cage, interacting and talking with you throughout the day.Be prepared to give your bird at least 3 to 4 hours of supervised time out of the cage each day. Provide a freestanding play structure somewhere outside the cage for the bird to stretch its wings. During this period, give it the essential social interaction that it craves from you.</p><p>If you will not be releasing the bird from its its cage much, give it a spacious enclosure (36-by-36-by-36 inches) and fill it with toys that it can chew. Toys will help your bird get some exercise and stimulation.If you do not provide it with chewable toys, your conure might find less desirable items to chew, such as wires, furniture, and woodwork around the house.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Intelligent, can be taught tricks and to speak</p><p>Kid friendly, not much of a biter</p><p>Can get loud; may scream or shriek when excited, bored, or alarmed</p><p>Requires at least 3 to 4 hours of daily exercise and socialization</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Blue-crowned Conure </h2><p>The blue-crowned conure breeds readily in captivity and is one of few parrot species that is relatively easy to find in pet stores and from breeders.You can expect to pay from $1,000 to $2,000,</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, ask how long they have been breeding and working with the species and tour their facility. When perusing their inventory, looks forsigns of overall good health of the flock. The birds should be active and alert with bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1136
25,https://www.thesprucepets.com/european-starlings-390853,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Medium Birds Breeds,<h1>European Starling (Common Starling): Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>European Starling (Common Starling): Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>The European starling, or the common starling, is one of the most widely distributed wild birds in North America. While not sold in pet stores, orphaned wild birds adopted by humans can make surprisingly good pets that are devoted to humans and capable of learning speech.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Starling, European starling, common starling, English starling</p><p>Adult Size: 10 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Starlingsare native toEurope and came to North America during the late 1800s. It is an extremely adaptable species with North American estimated to have more than 200 million starlingsall of them thought to have descended from a flock of 100 birds released in New York's Central Park in 1890. Wild populations of European starlings live in every continental U.S. state and Canadian territory. The bird is so prevalent that it is invasive in some areas.</p><p>While the Migratory Bird Treaty Act protects wild birds from human interference, the European starling is one of three species excluded, since it is an introduced species and not a native one. Most pet starlings are orphaned wild babies that were rejected or fell from their nests. There is no federal law preventing people from keeping starlings as pets but check with state and local wildlife regulatory agencies to learn about any local laws.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Starlings are active, social birds that seemingly enjoy spending time with their owners. Pet European starlings are known for bonding closely with their caretakersand seeking them out for companionship. Although wild birds, they are easy to tame and keep as pets. Once bonded with an owner, they will be affectionate and get cuddly with their keepers.</p><p>Starlings are very curious, smart, and interactive. They can obey commands, talk, and even perform tricks.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Starlings are every bit as intelligent as other more common pet bird species and can learn to talk. European starlings are accomplished mimics, often copying songs or sounds of other birds and animals (frog calls, goats, cats), or even of mechanical sounds. According to some, starlings can talk better than parrots.</p><h2>European Starling Colors and Markings </h2><p>Adult starlings are predominantly black; their plumage has subtle color changes that change with the seasons. During the spring and summer months, the feathers on their head and chest take on beautiful iridescent hues of purple and green. Their legs are pink.</p><p>In the colder months, their feathers develop beautiful white tips or stars (giving it its name). Juveniles look completely differentwithbrown plumage until they molt into their adult plumage.</p><p>Theadult female starlinglooks less glossy and oily than itsmalecounterpart, but a keydifferenceto tell the sexes apart is the color of their bills; blue for themalesand pink for thefemales.</p><h2>Caring for the European Starling </h2><p>If you choose to care for a starling, you will need to understand that you are making a long-term commitment. Starlings can live for up to 20 years. You can't just release one back into the wild if you tire from taking care of it.</p><p>Once these birds imprint on their human caretakers (which happens very quickly if they are handfed as babies), they will not be able to join a wild flock. Starlings raised by humans have no idea how to relate to other birds and will be clueless as to how to hunt for food.</p><p>Starlings produce very loose droppings that can be extremely messy in a cage or aviary. Owners need to frequently clean the cage throughout the day.</p><p>Starlings do acceptably well in a large parrot cage or small aviary, but an entire room is a better setting. Ideally, the cage or enclosure should be large enough to provide the bird with much-needed flight space. If kept in a smaller cage (minimum size: 3 feet square), be prepared to give the bird a couple of hours of supervised exercise time in a bird-safe room each day out of the cage.To make a room bird-safe, remove toxic plants, turn off ceiling fans, close doors and windows, cover the fireplace, and do not allow any other pets in the room.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The most common illness that affects starlings is hyperkeratosis, which appears linked to a low-iron diet. An overgrowth of keratin can affect a bird's feathers, wings, feet, legs, beak, and nails.</p><p>Be mindful that wild starling droppings can cause some diseases that cause illness in humans, including salmonella, histoplasmosis, and several other bacterial and viral infections.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, the European starling is a softbill species that typically eats soft foods such as insects, flowers, and buds. Commercially prepared bird diets, even those meant for songbirds, are not nutritionally adequate for starlings.</p><p>The healthiest and longest-lived pet starlings eat a mixture that must be prepared by their owners. The ratio for this mixture includes 2 cups of soaked dry dog or cat food and 1/2 cup of poultry mash (or softbill pellets). In two separate bowls, provide a tablespoon of applesauce and a tablespoon of hard-boiled egg.Remove uneaten foods after one hour to prevent spoilage.</p><p>As a treat in a separate bowl, you can offer the following fruits: figs (considered a superfruit for its extremely high nutritional content), berries, grapes, or cherries. For vegetables, you can provide sweet potatoes, carrots, beets, turnips, green beans, corn, tomatoes, and peas. Good leafy greens to offer include dandelion greens, beet greens, broccoli florets, celery leaves, and turnip greens. You can also provide crickets or mealworms, which you can purchase through online pet stores and reptile suppliers.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Starlings enjoy being active, and they need proper exercise to stay in top condition. Starlings do not climb as parrots do, so most of their activity comes fromfreeflight. Starling owners need to realize thatwing clippingis not an option for these birds. It is highly recommended that starlings enjoy a minimum of at least 2 hours of supervised free flight outside of the cage.</p><p>Keep starlings in an area where there is a lot of human activity. These are intelligent birds that need a lot of mental stimulation. Make sure to provide plenty of toys and other items in the cage to keep them occupied. Provide plenty of leaves and small twigs for the birds to peck and shred; this will help keep them engaged.</p><p>Sweet, affectionate disposition, easy to tame</p><p>Intelligent, can learn to speak and do tricks</p><p>Requires large cage or aviary and couple hours of exercise</p><p>Needs homemade diet</p><p>Cannot find for sale in pet stores or breeders</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a European Starling </h2><p>Most pet starlings are young orphaned birds that are found and adopted byhumans. Obtaining a starling can be difficult, you cannot commonly buy this species in pet stores or through breeders. Because it is an invasive species in some areas, animal rescue organizations may not even accept starlings. If you want one, your best bet is to talk to rescues, vets that treat wild birds, and exterminators during the springtime when these birds are nesting.</p>",1140

Black-capped conures can be slightly shy, but once comfortable with their adopted family; they are an inquisitive and loving pet. This bird has the notable advantage of being a quieter species than other conures.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black-capped conure, rock parakeet, black-capped parakeet, the rock parakeet, Sandia conure</p><p>Scientific Name: with two subspecies: (native to central Peru) and (native to central and southeastern Peru, northern Bolivia, and southwestern Brazil)</p><p>Adult Size: 9 to 10 inches inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 30 years in captivity</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The black-capped conure is nativeto areas of South America, including Peru, Bolivia, and southwestern Brazil. It lives in humid forest ranging from the Amazonian lowlands up to the slopes of the eastern Andes to an altitude of about 6,000 feet. Because much of this bird's native habitat is being disturbed, it is a ""near threatened"" species for extinction.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Black-capped conures make beautiful, fun-loving pets. While they do require a great deal of attention from their owners, they always seem to reward human efforts with their hilarious antics. They enjoy interacting with their owners and crave daily playtime and attention. These birds will become easy-going and friendly with family membersbut can remain a bit shy with strangers.</p><p>Conures do best in a household that is active and bustling, as the activity keeps them interested and stimulated. If you are interested in a black-capped conure, make sure you have plenty of time to socialize and interact with the bird.</p><p>Highly social and trainable, these intelligent creatures can get bored if not mentally stimulated or ignored. Even hand-raised parrots can reject human interaction if left alone for long periods or if they feel neglected. A lonely bird can become depressed and develop both medical and behavioral problems as a result.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>This bird is one of the quieter of the conure species. It is not known to be one of the best talkers, but with patient training, the black-capped conure can learn a small repertoire of words and phrases.</p><h2>Black-Capped Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>The black-capped conure is a mostly green bird with an unusual brown-black cap and whitish scale pattern on the neck and breast. It has touches of red along the leading edge of the upper wing coverts. The green abdomen is tinged with bluish marking, and the tail feathers have dark gray undersides. The feet, legs, and beak are gray. Males and females are identical in coloring.The only way to tell the sexes apart is through DNA testing or a surgical sexing procedure.</p><p>One mutation of this species, the yellow-sided black-capped conure, has yellow shading on the sides of the head and neck.</p><h2>Caring for the Black-Capped Conure </h2><p>In nature, black-capped conures form flocks of about 30 birds. In captivity, they will do best in an environment with a lot of noise and activity. Black-capped conures thrive when there is social interaction with their human family.</p><p>Be prepared to give your conure two to four hours of out-of-cage time for exercise and interaction. Make sure to supervise this time, as this curious bird can quickly get into trouble if not watched. Beware of this bird chewing on furniture or wires or making attempts to fly out of open doors, windows, or near operating ceiling fans.</p><p>A black-capped conure needs a cage large enough to provide space for daily exercise. The smallest acceptable cage is 18-inch long and wide and at least 2-feet high. If you will not be able to offer several hours of out-of-cage time daily for flying and playing, then the bird will need a larger cage that allows it to fly and exercise on its own.</p><p>Provide sturdy perches within the cage, as well as plenty of chew toys. Change the toys frequently to keep the bird curious and stimulated. Provide an out-of-cage play apparatus like a playpen or play gym for the bird to use during its out-of-cage exercise periods.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Conures, in general, are among the hardiest of parrots; many owners may never experience a severe health problem. Like other conures, though, the black-capped conure can be prone to feather picking, which is usually a sign the bird is bored and in need of more attention and stimulation.</p><p>Infrequently, a conure can get ill from diseases that commonly affect other parrots. These diseases include proventricular dilatationdisease (an avian viral disease), psittacinebeak and feather disease (a viral disease), psittacosis bacterial infection, beak malocclusion (beak overbite), and aspergillosis fungal infection.</p><p>Your bird will need to see an avian veterinarian for the treatment of any illness and regular checkups.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild,these birds eat a variety of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and berries. In captivity, feed your bird a high-quality, formulated pellet along with a daily diet of fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p>You can give them an unlimited amount of pellet food; they will only eat what they need. As for fresh fruits and veggies, offer about a 1/8 to 1/4 cup in the morning and at night.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>All conures are active birds, and this is especially true of the black-capped conure. To keep your bird healthy and in good physical condition, your pet bird will need at least 2 hours of out-of-cage time each day in a safe, supervised play area.</p><p>Your bird will need a nice variety of chew toys that it can use to exercise its jaw muscles and provide mental stimulation. Several perches of different diameters will help keep your parrot's feet limber.</p><p>Curious, loving pet with its adopted human family</p><p>Quieter species, it can still learn to speak a few words</p><p>Small bird that can be housed in a smaller cage taking up a smaller footprint</p><p>Not the best talker</p><p>Requires at least two to four hours of supervised out-of-cage exercise</p><p>Tends to be shy with strangers</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Black-Capped Conure </h2><p>It's always worth checking with animal rescue organizations and animal adoption agencies if you are interested in owning a black-capped conure.

It usually lives in flocks of 10 to 20 birds at treetop level or larger flocks where there is more food.</p><h3>What Is a Conure?</h3><p>The term conure refers to a diverse group of small-to-medium-sized parakeets and parrots typically found in the Western Hemisphere. The birds are characterized by their colorful feathers and playful personalities and are often kept as pets.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Green-cheeked conures are popular pet birds. They are affectionate and playful and thrive on time spent socializing with their owners. Like all birds, green-cheeked conures can be nippy and uncooperative at times, but as a general rule, they are among the most easygoing of the conure species. Although most never talk, green-cheeked conures do well with training and are known to be fast learners. They can learn to do simple tricks. Most owners say that their big personalities make up for what they lack in the speech department.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Although quieter than most conure species, this species can still be a noisy bird, which may pose a problem for apartment-dwellers. Some can learn a few words, but green-cheeked conures are not generally known as great talkers.</p><h2>Green-Cheeked Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>Males and females have identical coloring. Green-cheeked conures display an array of colors in their plumage, sporting bright red feathers in their tails and on their chests, bright green on their backs and the tops of their wings, olive green surrounding the red patch on their chest, a whitish ring around the neck, black plumage on the head, and olive green patches on their cheeks. Their long pointed tail is mostly blue or maroon. They have black beaks and feet and display bare white rings around their eyes.</p><p>Several color variations were selectively bred in captivity, including turquoise, yellow-sided, cinnamon, and pineapple conures.</p><h2>Caring for the Green-Cheeked Conure </h2><p>While the green-cheeked conure's beauty and brains makeit an attractive potential pet, the truth is that not just anyone can properly care for a conure or any bird. Parrots are a big commitment requiring daily exercise and socialization, a continuous supply of fresh foods per day, and space for their sizable cage and flying activities.</p><p>A green-cheeked conure may not require the kind of space a larger parrot needs, but provide you will still need an enclosure that is at least 24 inches square and 30 inches high with metal bars spaced 1/2 to 3/4 inch apart. As with any parrot, a bigger cage is always better. Provide several perches at least nine inches long and 1/2 inch in diametera variety of perch sizes will help keep your parrot's feet limber.</p><p>A green-cheeked conure should do well when paired with other green-cheeked conures, but do not house them with different species of birds. If you house more than one bird in the cage, make sure you increase the size of the cage per bird. The more birds you put together, the larger the cage will need to be.</p><p>In its natural environment, the green-cheeked conure lives in a flock. As a pet, it still needs a considerable amount of interaction with you. Expect that your bird may need two to four hours outside the cage for exercise and social time every day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>All conures are prone to feather picking, which usually occurs because the birds are bored or neglected. A number of common parrot maladies can affect these birds, such as proventricular dilatation disease (PDD), a nervous system disease; psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), a deadly virus; psittacosis, a bacterial infection; beak malocclusion or beak misalignment; and aspergillosis, a fungal infection. Have your bird checked by an avian veterinarian regularly to catch problems early, while they can be easily treated.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, green-cheeked conures feast on fruits, vegetables, seeds, and the occasional insect or two. Pet conures in captivity should have a similar diet. For optimal health, feed your conure a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables supplemented with a high-quality pelleted diet. An easy way to incorporate a variety of fresh foods is to use the chop concept, which involves making a preparing salad mixture in advance.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Exercise is extremely important for green-cheeked conures as it is for all parrots. In the wild, these birds might fly many miles per day in search of food, a mate, or a nesting site. It can be hard to provide the means to duplicate this in captivity, but if you can devote a minimum of two hours per day to supervising your conure during out-of-cage exercise and playtime,your bird is likely to remain healthy and happy. A helpful way to achieve this lifestyle requirement is to get a cage with a play gym on the top of their cage. This can be a safe place for them to expand their wings during supervised exercise time.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Intelligent, can be taught tricks</p><p>Quieter than other parrots</p><p>May not be as noisy, but can still get loud and may not be well-suited for apartments</p><p>Requires at least two to four hours of exercise, socialization</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Green-Cheeked Conure </h2><p>Before purchasing a conure from a bird store or breeder, check animal shelters and rescue organizations.

Its eye-catching colors makethis species appealing to bird lovers of all types, but it may not be the best choice for inexperienced bird owners. This bird is not easy to train or handle.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Crimson rosella, Pennant's rosella</p><p>Scientific Name: with seven subspecies:and</p><p>Adult Size: Crimson rosellas aremedium-sizedbirds, measuring about 10 to 14 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: On average, 20 to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The crimson rosella is a medium-sized parrot that is native to eastern and southeastern Australia. It lives in open forests and woodlands, as well as gardens and parklands. The species was scientifically named by John Latham in 1781 after British naturalist Thomas Pennant. Pennant never left Europe, but he devoted his life to illustrating and describing European animals, mostly in Britain.</p><p>In 1825, the bird was reclassified to the genus.Platycerus means ""broad-tailed"" or ""flat-tailed,"" reflecting a feature common to rosellas and other broad-tailed parrots. Early European settlers first encountered theeastern rosellaatRose Hill, New South Wales, so it was first called the Rosehillparakeet, which became ""Rosehiller,"" and eventually ""rosella.""</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Owners of crimson rosellas have noted that these birds need socialization and handling every day to remain tame and friendly with their human family members.</p><p>Some crimson rosellas may go through a nippybluffing phaseduring adolescence, which owners must find a way to work through.</p><p>Overall, however, these are sweet, albeit mischievous little birds. Because of their high intelligence and curious nature, they must be under constant supervision when out of their cages to prevent them from getting into trouble.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>While these birds can learn to speak a few words, crimson rosellas are not especially good talkers. These parrots are not the right choice for those who have their hearts set on owning a talking bird. They can, however, learn to mimic whistled tunes rather easily.</p><p>Less vocal than many other hookbill species, crimsonrosellas still have deafening raucous calls that they will display from time to time. Their normal vocalization is a high-pitched whistle that can get quite shrill when the bird is alarmed.</p><h2>Crimson Rosella Colors and Markings </h2><p>Crimson rosellas have a slender body likeAsiatic parakeets. They are a dimorphic species, meaning you can tell the sexes apart by looking at them. Male birds are mostly a vivid red with patches of bright blue on their faces and wings with black feathers highlighting the feathers on their backs. They have long blue tail feathers. Females of the species look mostly the same, but they sport a dark greenish patch above the middle of their tail feathers.</p><p>The various related subspecies show different patterns of color and, in some instances, entirely different hues. for example, is a yellow bird. Other subspecies, though, can rightly be called crimson, but with variations in shading and pattern.</p><h2>Caring for a Crimson Rosella </h2><p>Crimson rosellas are not cuddly, human-friendly birds like other parrots. This bird may willingly perch on a shoulder, but it is not likely to tolerate petting. If very tame, a rosella can be around a careful, older child, but this is not generally recommended since even well-trained birds tend to be nippy.</p><p>Rosellas are great aviary birds; they can freely exercise in outdoor aviaries. If an aviary is not an option, then provide the largest enclosure possible. At the very minimum, this bird can live in a medium-sized cage that is at least 30 inches square. It can be housed with another rosella in an aviary but tends to get aggressive with other species.</p><p>Rosellas can become nippy with their owners if they are not properly socialized. If you want a tame, friendly rosella, you must take the time to handle and play with the bird daily. Otherwise, you may end up with a grumpy bird prone to nipping or biting. Practicebonding techniques,so your rosella becomes comfortable with being part of a human family.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Crimson rosellas can be prone to fungal infections and intestinal worms, primarily when housed in outdoor aviaries where they may forage at ground level. Rosellas are also susceptible to psittacosis, which is a bacterial chlamydia infection also called parrot fever.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, crimson rosellas eat mostly native grass seeds, herbs, fruits and berries, nuts, insect larvae, and flower buds. In captivity, it is essential to provide this bird a varied and nutritious diet similar to what they would eat in the wild.</p><p>Most rosella owners provide their birds with a good quality seed or pellet mix formulated for canaries andcockatiels. Then, they supplement that with plenty of fresh,bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Feed approximately 1/4 to 1/3 cup of seed or pelleted food and 1/4 to 1/3 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily.A raw and varied diet will help ensure that your bird maintains top nutrition.</p><p>Many rosellas also enjoy bits of a boiled egg with their meals, which helps replace the protein lost by not hunting insects in the wild.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>This species is relatively sedentary. However, young, untamed birds may benefit from a larger cage that allows them space to fly. Free flight is essential for this bird, it needs at least 2 hours of exercise daily.</p><p>If caged all day, make sure the bird is given a safe room to fly that is secure. Close all windows, doors and chimneys should be blocked off, heaters and fans turned off, and potentially toxic house plants need to be removed or covered. If trained from a young age, these birds can learn to perch on an arm and return to their cage.</p><p>Rosellas are notorious chewers that quickly grow bored with their playthings, so it is vital to keep your bird entertained with plenty of bird-safe and interesting toys. If you don't give them toys, then your belongings may turn up missing. Rosellas are infinitely curious little birds that may steal jewelry, keys, buttons, and other items from their owners.</p><p>Beautiful and eye-catching vibrantly colored birds</p><p>Can learn to say a few words or mimic a tune</p><p>Tends to nip or bite</p><p>Requires an experienced bird owner</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Crimson Rosella </h2><p>Contact a local crimson rosella breeder and see if you can meet with them and their pets to see first-hand how these birds interact in a home environment.Breeders sell crimson rosellas in the range of $300 to $500.

They are highly intelligent and curious parrots, making them eager to explore and prone to getting into trouble when left unsupervised. When properly cared for, however, white-eyed conure owners report these birds are exceedingly loving and entertaining. White-eyed conures need adequate mental stimulation to prevent boredom and behavior problems from setting in.</p><p>For a conure, this species is one of the tamest and will learn to speak. They need attention, patience, and toys. This bird loves to climb and play.</p><p>Those interested in owning a white-eyed conure should make sure they can spare at least 3 to 4 hours per day to interact with their pet.

They can also make a very nice and affectionate companion pet that is spunky, smart, and entertaining, though they are rare and expensive. One thing is for surethese are very special parrots that seem to steal the hearts of every bird owner they meet.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Golden conure, Queen of Bavaria conure,golden parakeet, golden parrot, yellow conure</p><p>Scientific Name: , formerly</p><p>Adult Size: A large conure, it can reach a length of around 14 inches, weighing about 8 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Native to northeastern Brazil, golden conures are only found in a small area south of the Amazon River. Spotting wild golden conures is difficultdespite their colorbecause they are not especially social and rarely form flocks. This means that their life in the wild is relatively unknown. It's believed that they are nomadic, moving from the lowland humid forests to the tall trees of terra firma (lands that don't flood), then to clearings during the breeding season.</p><p>These birds have been on the endangered species list since 1975, and their small population contributes to the lack of sightings. While it's been accepted for some time that fewer than 3,000 goldens were left, a 2016 International Union for Conservation of Nature update says that this was an underestimate. It is now thought that the population is anywhere from 6,600 to 13,400 birds.</p><p>This realization has not quelled fears of the bird's endangered status, though. It's projected that the population will continue to decline due to habitat destruction and illegal trapping, including taking babies from the nest. Captive breeding programs are a big focus for this species and take a priority over selling them as pets for many breeders.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Golden conures are active pets that love to climb, chew, and play. Owners must be diligent to supervise these birds when out of the cageto avoid accidents due to their overwhelming curiosity about the world around them.</p><p>Being a conure, these birds are very vocal and can produce loud screams, making them a poor choice for those who live in apartments or condominiums. They can, however, develop a rather extensive vocabulary.</p><p>Golden conures are highly intelligent and need plenty of mental stimulation in order to prevent boredom and destructive behavior patterns from setting in. In this regard, it's slightly more sensitive than many other parrots.</p><p>While feather plucking is often a warning you'll hear with neglected or bored parrots, for golden conures, stress is the leading cause of this self-destructive behavior they seem prone to. It can be prevented with tons of attention and distractions and giving the bird a certain amount of freedom.</p><p>In general,golden conures do make great pets. They enjoy cuddling and are receptive to multiple people when socialized properly, so they do well with families. Aggression is typically not an issue except when they're breeding.</p><h2>Golden Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>Golden conures are often mistaken for macaws because of their larger head and beak. The tell-tale difference is that the conure's tail is much shorter than what you'll find on macaws.</p><p>Mature golden conures are a bright yellow color all over their bodies. The only exception is the tips of the flight feathers, which are dark green in color. They have a bald ring around their eyes, horn-colored beaks, and pink legs and feet.</p><p>Juvenile golden conures can be identified by green speckles in the yellow plumage of the body.</p><h2>Caring for a Golden Conure </h2><p>Golden conures are affectionate, beautiful, and intelligent, making them excellent pets. Unfortunately, they are rather expensive and nearly as rare in captivity as they are in the wild. They can be quite hard to find as their sale is heavily regulated both in and outside of the United States.</p><p>Don't worry, though, if you have your heart set on owning a golden conure, itpossible. You may just have to jump through some hoops to make it happen. For example, you and the seller will both need a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in order to purchase a parrot from another state. Do plenty of research on what's required before you adopt. To locate a golden conure breeder, a great place to start is Bird Talk magazine's breeder directory.</p><p>If and when you are able to locate an available golden conure, you will be rewarded with an incredibly entertaining and interactive pet. Owners report that their birds have been able to learn many fun tricks, develop impressive vocabularies, and even seem to speak in context at times.</p><p>It's important that your bird does not feel confined most of the time. The golden conure's high energy level needs to be taken into account when selecting a cage. It should be large enough to give him room to roam, climb around, and burn energy. They rarely fly in captivity but that doesn't mean these acrobats will be happy in a smaller dwelling.</p><h2>Feeding the Golden Conure </h2><p>Golden conures in the wild normally feast on a varied diet of fresh fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, and grain. Feeding an equally diverse diet is best and will ensure your bird remains healthy. It should consist of fresh foods like fruits, nuts, berries, and vegetables, along with high-quality commercial pellets. This combination will ensure that pet conures receive adequate nutrition.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Being active birds, golden conures require quite a bit of exercise in order to maintain top physical condition. Those who would like to own a golden conure should make sure that they can spare a minimum of three to four hours a day supervising their bird during out of cage exercise and play time.</p><p>Golden conures love to climb, and seem to appreciate toys like ladders, ropes, and swings that give them something to ""navigate."" A play stand is also necessary to give the birds a sense of freedom out of the cage while having a home base that's filled with toys to occupy their time. They're quite comical in these playful adventures and will often seek out your attention.</p><p>These birds are also heavy chewers who need to exercise their strong jaw muscles. Golden conure owners quickly learn to provide their pets with plenty of chew toys in order to spare their own belongings. Wood will be your mainstay as it's easily replaced, though leather, rope, and beads will also be appreciated.</p>",1063

It is a very active bird, curious about the world, comical, and eager to explore. It can also be somewhat temperamental and can be prone to nipping. It will scream if denied the attention it wants and needs. This may not be a great bird for a beginner, an owner sensitive to noise, or an apartment dwellerwith nearby neighbors. Like watchdogs, mitred conures are magnificent ""watch birds"" due to their piercingly loud alarm calls when approached by strangers.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Mitredconure, mitred parakeet, red-headed conure</p><p>Adult Size: One of the largest of the conures, measuring 13 to 15 inches in length, weighing about 7 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The mitred conure is native to the South American Andes Mountain region including north-central Peru, Bolivia, and northwestern Argentina. It typically inhabits high-altitude forests located 3,000 to 11,000 feet above sea level. This species has been introduced to California, Florida,and Hawaii, where they are sometimes considered a nuisance due to the crop damage they can cause.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Tame, hand-fed mitred conures can make affectionate family pets when given plenty of love and attention. Mitred conures are a good choice for owners who enjoy spending time interacting with a pet bird.This bird will need at least two to four hours of exercise, interaction, and social time with you per day.</p><p>As with any pet bird, mitred conures have their moods. And, like other conure species, this bird can get nippy. For this reason, a conure is not the best pet for households with small children, but they can make good family pets in homes with older children who understand how to handle and respect birds.</p><p>Mitred conures that are well socialized can still get loud. You can expect noisy screeching, screams, and squawking during the dawn and dusk periods.</p><p>Clownish by nature, this species is intelligent and may perform tricks to gain your attention and affection.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Conures are among the most talkative parrots. Mitred conures will amaze you with their grasp of words and phrases. Their high-pitched voices often make them sound funny and unintelligible. This doesn't stop them from being chatty and fun little talkers with their murmurs and trills.</p><h2>Mitred Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>A mature mitred conure is vivid green with spots of bright red on its face, head, neck, and the top half of its legs. It has a bare white ring around the eyes with a horn-colored beak and gray feet. Males and females are identical in color. It can be difficult to distinguish it from its close relative, the cherry-headed conure. The main difference between them is that the mitredis missing the bright red spot on the bend of the wing.</p><h2>Caring for the Mitred Conure </h2><p>A mitred conure needs a substantially-sized cage with at least a 24-inch square footprint and 36 inches in height at the minimum. Provide perches that are rated for strong chewers and change them frequently to prevent the bird from getting bored. Mitred conures are athletic birds that should also have a play area or gym stand outside its cage.</p><p>These birds love to bathe and can be showered with a spray bottle or under a sink sprayer regularly.</p><p>All conures are flock-oriented birds. Be prepared to fill in as the role of the bird's flockmate. They require activities and mental stimulation to prevent boredom and the behavior problems that come from neglect. Bored or lonely conures may bite you, chew unapproved items, or scream. Plan to socialize with your bird at least two hours per day. A great activity is teaching the bird to mimic words and phrases. A bird that learns a lot of words is a bird that is less inclined to scream.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The mitred conure, like other conures, is a relatively hardy bird compared to other parrots. But it is prone to some of the same health issues that affect other conures:</p><p>If a bird gets bored or feels neglected, it may start a self-mutilating behavior of feather plucking. Have your bird checked by an avian veterinarian annually or if your bird starts acting lethargic, stops eating, or seems unusual to you.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, mitred conures feast mostly on fruit, nuts, and seeds. In captivity, they function best on a balanced, pelleted diet supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, and occasionally, nuts. Feed fresh food and water daily.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As with all birds, proper exercise is imperative to a mitred conure's good health.Mitred conures are very active and inquisitive, and they need adequate space to fly, explore, and play. Your mitred conure should be allowed sufficient time out of his cage every day for supervised playtime. This bird is at its best when it has four hours of free flight time out of the cage in a safe space daily.</p><p>Like all parrots, mitred conures need to chew and should have plenty of sturdy play toys to gnaw on. Toys help channel its gnawing instinct in a positive direction and provide good mouth exercise.</p><p>Can be affectionate with their owner</p><p>Intelligent, can be taught tricks and to speak</p><p>Acts as a good stranger alarm</p><p>Noisy periods at dawn and dusk</p><p>Requires at least two to four hours of exercise, socialization</p><p>Tendency to be nippy</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mitred Conure </h2><p>If you want a mitred conure, check with animal rescue organizations and adoption societies. Mitered conures are such loud birdsthat some owners who can't deal with the noise may give up their birds.</p><p>Although aviary pet stores may have mitred conures, a bird breeder is usually a better option. The average cost is from $500 to $2,000. The Beauty of Birds is an organization that maintains a directory of reputable parrot breeders in the U.S. If you are looking for abird breeder, interview the breeder, look at the general health of their birds, check out their living conditions, and talk to past customers.

This Asian parrot makes a good pet, as it is less aggressive and possessive than some other parrot species, and it gets along well with others. It is less demanding of an owner's time than many other parrots, but it still needs regular interaction to remain socialized.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Plum-headed parakeet, plum-headed parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches, weighing 2.3 to 2.8 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 and 20 years, although many can live 30 years or more with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Plum-headed parakeets hail from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh. They thrive in the woodlands and forested areas, where they make the trees their habitat. Escaped pet plum-headed parakeets live in a variety of climates around the world, sometimes establishing small breeding populations.</p><p>A variation of this species, the so-called intermediate parakeet , is thought to be a hybrid between the plum-headed and the slaty-headed parakeet.</p><p>Although wild numbers of this bird are gradually dwindling due to habitat loss, plum-headed parakeets still thrive and are not threatened by extinction.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Plum-headed parakeets are generally gentle, social, and affectionate birds with their owners, although they can be somewhat stand-offish with strangers. They are relatively quiet for a parrot, so they may be the right choice for those bird owners who live inapartmentsor other housing situations near neighbors.</p><p>When hand-fed as babies, plum-headed parakeets can become very tame and will bond strongly with their owners. This bird is less demanding of an owner's time than many parrots. However, regular interaction is still necessary to maintain human bonding.</p><p>It is essential for those who do not have experience with species to understand that many of these birds will go through abluffingphase during their adolescence. This phase is strictly hormone-related and is not an indication of how the bird's personality will be once it reaches maturity. Generally, birds that arehandleddaily stay tame and bond well with their owners.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Many of these birdsespecially the malesare good talkers. The chattering that begins at about 6 to 8 months of age may give way to coherent mimicry very soonif an owner is willing to talk regularly to the bird. Speech is not a universal skill, and some birds will never exhibit this talent.</p><h2>Plum-Headed Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Plum-headed parakeets are a dimorphic species, so it is relatively easy to tell mature males and females apart by the color variants of their plumage. The body of both sexes is primarily green with varying shades occurring on the breast, abdomen, back, and wings. Males have purplish-red heads that are outlined by a black ring around the neck. Females exhibit blue-gray feathers on their headsand lack the black neck stripe. Instead, many of them have yellow-tinged feathers around their necks.</p><h2>Caring for the Plum-Headed Parakeet </h2><p>Because it has such a long tail, a plum-headed parakeet is best suited to a relatively large cage. A cage with a 24-inch-by-36-inch footprint and 36 inches in height is a minimum requirement. Bar spacing should be no more than 1/2 inch. Include a different play gym containing toys within the cage, and another play gym separate from the cage for exercise periods. If you are keeping a pair of birds, provide them with a larger aviary enclosure. In an aviary setting, the plum-headed is one of the few parrots that will happily coexist with non-competing birds, such as finches.</p><p>Like any parrot, the plum-headed parakeet needs some time each day outside the cage, but unlike other, more demanding parrots, the plum-headed is not a cuddler that needs constant petting and hands-on play. Instead, it will likely be content to merely sit on your shoulder and ""talk"" with you. Without this level of daily interaction, though, the bird may withdraw and even become somewhat wild again.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Plum-headed parakeets are relatively hardy birds, although they can be affected by damp, cold conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, this bird feeds mostly on fruit and seeds. Like other parrots, plum-headed parakeets do best in captivity when they eat a diet consisting of high-quality seed and pellet mix, supplemented daily with fresh,bird-safe fruits and vegetables. A bird will eat up to 1 tablespoon of food per day.</p><p>These birds enjoy variety in their diets, so experiment with foods like sprouts, leafy greens, berries, and even peppers. Birds cannot pick up on ""spicy hot"" flavors as humans do, so many of them enjoy picking apart spicy peppers to get at the seeds inside.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Plum-headed parakeets are very active birds in the wild. In captivity, these birds must have an exercise and play area. These birds should be allowed a minimum of 3 to 4 hours outside the cage each day, in a safe, bird-proofed play area. Always supervise this free period to prevent accidents and injuries. This exercise and interaction time is critical for keeping a plum-headed parakeet healthy and well socialized.</p><p>Social, although standoffish with strangers</p><p>Can be trained to talk</p><p>Affectionate, although does not like cuddling</p><p>Requires at least 3 hours of interaction or exercise daily</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Plum-Headed Parakeet </h2><p>Plum-headed parakeets are a common pet, and orphaned birds may be available, so check with rescue organizations and pet adoption agencies. Some aviary pet stores may sell this bird, although prospective owners will more likely need to seek out a breeder.</p><p>Pricing for this bird ranges from $400 to $700. If you're going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable by asking them how long they've been breeding the species. Make sure that your bird is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and a full crop.</p>",943

They're smart, social, and affectionate birds that can make great pets, though they get bored easily and require a good deal of stimulation, attention, and plenty of toys!</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>COMMON NAMES:Derbyan parakeet, Lord Derby's parakeet</p><p>SCIENTIFIC NAME:</p><p>ADULT SIZE:A medium-sized parrot approximately 18 to 19.6 inches in length and 11 ounces in weight</p><p>LIFE EXPECTANCY:Up to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Derbyan parakeet hails from the mountains of north-eastern India, south-eastern Tibet, and southern China, where they make their home in the Himalayan sub-alpine conifer forests native to those areas.</p><p>Despite the relatively remote nature of their habitat, Derbyan parakeets are unfortunately a threatened breed. This is due to high rates of deforestation, as well as an illegal poaching trade largely spurred on by wealthy bird owners in China, where Derbyan parakeets are considered to be a highly prized pet. While there are ongoing efforts to repopulate them in both the wild and in captivity, the species remains at risk.</p><p>Derbyan parakeets travel in flocks of about 40 to 60 birds, pairing off for the breeding season (April into June) and raising their chicks in tree hollows until they're ready to leave the nesta period of about eight to nine weeks following the chicks' incubation period.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Among their parrot peers, the Derbyan parakeet is known for being a highly intelligent and social bird, with a curious personality that can make them fun to train and engage with. These birds often become quite fond of their humans over time, showing outward affectionand even a willingness to cuddleto those who they feel closest to.</p><p>Due to their smarts, Derbyan parakeets require a lot of stimulation and are prone to displaying signs of boredom that may include unwanted chewing. For this reason, they need a good deal of toys and other engaging objects, as well as lots of interaction with their people.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Many Derbyan parakeets love to talk and can get quite noisy, though it's not a mainstay of the species and some will prefer to live their lives quietly. When well trained, Derbyan parakeets can go from babbling to competent speech, and are even known to form full and complete sentences.</p><h2>Derbyan Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Derbyan parakeets are sexually dimorphic, meaning the two sexes vary in certain colors and markings in addition to sex-specific organsthough there are some similarities.</p><p>The species presents with legs, wings, and neck that are mostly green, with an almost iridescent purplish-blue making up the color of their head, chest, and belly. Both females and males exhibit black facial stripes, one wrapping around their forehead and another around their chin and neck.</p><p>A major physical difference between female and male Derbyan parakeets is their beaks, with females presenting with an all-black beak and males with an orangey-red beak.</p><h2>Caring for the Derbyan Parakeet </h2><p>Because they're used to roaming free in the mountains, Derbyan parakeets are happiest when they have plenty of room to move around. A large and well-lit cage is a requirement, with lots of time outside of the cage to explore (though it's advised to stick close, since they do have a tendency to get into trouble if left alone).</p><p>Caring for a Derbyan parakeet requires providing plenty of one-on-one attention. Most enjoy learning new words and phrases from their humans, as well as engaging with toys and simply hanging out and watching TV on your shoulder.</p><p>Occasional baths are recommended, and food and water bowls should be cleaned daily. Derbyan parakeets are pretty adaptable, but do try to stay consistent in terms of activity, socialization, and daily care.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The Derbyan parakeet is known to be a generally healthy bird, so long as their needs are being met in terms of space, diet, and socialization. As with any pet bird, they should not be neglected or left alone for too long, and you should keep an eye out for signs of distress or depression, such as lethargy, apathy, or skin troubles.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Seeds and pellets are a staple of the Derbyan parakeet's diet, but they also have a taste for variety and enjoy a wide range of fruits, veggies, and legumes. Be sure to provide a balanced diet, and mix it up with treats like berry and broccoli skewers or fresh tropical fruits.</p><p>As with all birds, provide fresh water daily in addition to a healthy diet, and avoid foods like avocado and chocolate, which are toxic to birds.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Both mental and physical stimulation are key to a happy and healthy Derbyan parakeet. This active bird needs room to play, plus time out of the cage to exercise and explore.</p><p>Because this species likes to chew, provide safe accessories like cuttlebones for them to do so (and to keep them from chewing on things they're not supposed to). This should be in addition to toys and perches, which you'll want to clean regularly.</p><p>Highly intelligent</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Can get noisy, so not always suitable for apartment living</p><p>Will get despondent if not provided with ample socialization</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Derbyan Parakeet </h2><p>It can be difficult to find a Derbyan parakeet in the United States, but if you've got your heart set on one then it's worth keeping an eye on parrot rescue groups and rehoming societies.

They need three to four hours outside of the cage each day to exercise and work their muscles. An assortment of bird-safe toys will help to keep your parrot occupied while it's in its cage. Provide another set of toys during its out-of-cage time for extra mental and physical stimulation.</p><p>Calm disposition</p><p>Often good in apartments</p><p>Needs lots of exercise</p><p>Susceptible to fungal infections</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Bronze-Winged Pionus </h2><p>To discover more about what it's like to live with a bronze-winged pionus, visit a local breeder or aviculture society. Inquire about an observation at their facility to spend time with a prospective pet bird. If you plan to buy one from a breeder, a hand-tamed young bird can cost around $900.</p><p>Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. Avoid a bird that is sitting quietly with puffed feathers; it might be ill. The bird's feathers should be smooth and shiny and lay down flat on its body. The feathers around the vent/cloaca (the opening where the bird expels feces and urine) should be clean and dry. The scales on its feet should be smooth. Also, make sure its nails are in good condition, and its beak is smooth and well-shaped. Plus, its nostrils should be clear and clean.</p>",932

Knowing its history and care requirements can help you determine whether or not this bird may be the right pet for you.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Red-bellied parrot, Red bellied parrot, Orange-bellied parrot, African orange-bellied parrot, Red-breasted parrot, Abyssinian parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 9 inches long and weighs about 5 oz.</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 20 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Red-bellied parrots are found in the wild in multiple East African countries including Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and Somalia where there are woodlands, dry brush, and scrubland areas. They are not an endangered species so they may be found in zoos as well as private homes as pets.</p><p>Red-bellied parrots got their name before the orange fruit was discovered in English-speaking countries. Their name would, of course, more appropriately be the orange-bellied parrot, but the word for both the fruit, and therefore the color orange, was not used until after this parrot was already named.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Red-bellied parrots are very social and active birds. A well-socialized red-bellied will be quite friendly and will even enjoy being petted, especially on its neck or head. These birds are also very smart and love to climb.</p><p>Biting can, of course, happen with any animal with a mouth, but if you are patient and not forceful with a timid red-bellied parrot, you will be rewarded with an opportunity to give and receive some affection.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Red-bellied parrots aren't thought of as vocal birds, but when they are compared to the nine other types of birds in the genus, they are known as the most talkative of the bunch and have excellent mimicking skills.</p><h2>Red-bellied Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Both male and female red-bellied parrots have red irises, dark gray beaks, and gray feet with four claws on each foot. Male red-bellied parrots can be told apart from females by their orange-coloured bellies, ashy-brown shoulders and neck, and a pale blue bottom.</p><p>Females, on the other hand, have gray feathers on their chests, pale green feathers on the belly with an occasional hint of orange, and a more pale gray head. These differences between the sexes are sexually dimorphic traits.</p><h2>Caring for the Red-bellied Parrot </h2><p>Red-bellied parrots need a lot of space and toys to play with to stay entertained. In the wild, they are flock species so they will either bond with other red-bellied parrots in the household or a human companion.</p><p>They are easily trained and socialized but require regular attention. A flight cage is ideal but not practical in most households. Regular time outside a cage is necessary for a red-bellied parrot to stretch their wings and do what birds do best.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Birds are prone to a number of respiratory issues including aspergillosis and pneumonia, as well as Bornavirus, liver disease, and behavioral issues. A proper diet, clean living environment, plenty of exercise, and regular check-ups with an avian veterinarian can help keep your red-bellied parrot healthy.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>While seed mixes are often fed as staple diets for red-bellied parrots, a high quality, pelleted bird food is a more ideal option. This combined with fresh fruit, vegetables, and occasional healthy treats such as multi-grain bread, pasta, and sugar-free cereals, will provide a more balanced diet than seeds alone. Seeds can be given on occasion, but diets heavy in fatty seeds like sunflowers will only lead to obesity and health issues.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Since red-bellied parrots are active and avid climbers, plenty of horizontal cage bars, various sized perches and branches, and a safe flight area should be provided.</p><p>Ropes, swings, and other items that a red-bellied parrot can hang upside down from or grab with its feet will be popular with your bird.</p><p>Friendly</p><p>Easily learns vocalizations</p><p>Playful</p><p>Small to medium sized</p><p>Requires a lot of attention</p><p>Needs space to exercise</p><p>Requires fresh fruits and vegetables</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Red-bellied Parrot </h2><p>Red-bellied parrots are not the most commonly found birds in pet stores, but that doesn't mean you can't find them. Some larger pet stores and bird speciality stores may have red-bellied parrots for sale or contact information for a local breeder.</p><p>Finally, your local avian veterinarian may have contacts for rescuing or purchasing a red-bellied parrot. Expect to pay more for a socialized compared to younger, unsocialized birds.</p><p>Regardless of where you decide to get your red-bellied parrot from, make sure the facility is clean, the birds there are alert, and there isn't fecal matter built up on their enclosures. Signs of an unhealthy bird include sneezing, fecal matter build up, closed eyes, and puffed feathers.</p>",782

They can be found in treetops, lowlands, and even savannahs in these large groups, except during the mating season when they pair off.</p><p>They are unique because they nest on termite mounds or in abandoned woodpecker holes. The half-moon conure is not an endangered species so they are sometimes found as pets, but are not as popular as other types of conures.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Half-moon conures are very active birds and love to play and climb. A well-socialized bird will enjoy attention from its owner and is typically good-natured.</p><p>They are not as excited about bathing as some other birds but may enjoy an occasional misting of water. Half-moon conures are typically not as destructive as some other conures and parrots can be.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These birds are quiet when compared to some other conures, but they will still make noise. Their volume is lower, however, so they are a good option if you want a medium-sized bird that isn't too chatty. They are not known to be talkers but may mimic some sounds.</p><h2>Half Moon Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>These conures are primarily a bright green with their back and wing feathers gradually turning into emerald green. They have a naked eye ring like macaws, a horn colored beak instead of a black one, and an orange band just above their beak with a blue forehead. Both males and females have the same colorations.</p><h2>Caring for the Half Moon Conure </h2><p>Like most conures, the half-moon variety needs a lot of attention and space. A cage will keep them safe, but that is not the only space they should have access to with supervision.</p><p>Regular veterinary care should also be provided to help keep a conure healthy and promptly spot any potential health issues.

This can be supplemented with a seed mixture, fresh fruits, vegetables, and healthy treats like sugar-free cereal, pasta, and whole-grain bread.</p><p>Changing the types of fruits and vegetables offered on a daily basis can provide some variety and mental stimulation to a bird as well.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like most birds, half-moon conures need a lot of exercise and space to stretch their wings. Safe flight areas are ideal, but time outside a cage should be provided daily regardless to allow a bird to explore, play with toys, climb, and be mentally stimulated.</p><p>A cage should only be for secure housing when supervision is not possible. Otherwise, cage toppers, play gyms, flight areas, and other spaces should be made available to a bird.</p><p>Quiet compared to other conures</p><p>Not very destructive</p><p>Not as colorful as some conures</p><p>Does not typically talk</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Half Moon Conure </h2><p>Half-moon conures are not as common as some other types of pet birds, so it will take a little more work if you are looking to adopt or purchase one.

If you're looking for a small parrot that might talk and perch on your shoulder, the moustached parakeet is a species to consider.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Moustached parakeet, mustache parakeet, Java parakeet, red-breasted parakeet</p><p>Adult Size: 13 to 15 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 25 years with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The moustached parakeet has extensive range in southeast Asia. It is native to China and the islands of Indonesia, where several subspecies live. Feral populations are spreading to many other areas, including neighboring cities. Their shrinking natural habitat causes flocks to become urban dwellers.</p><p>In the wild, this species tends to live in woodlands, hills, and mountains and gather in flocks of up to 60 birds. The group can become quite loud, so it's hard to miss them. This bird has an unmistakably deafening warning calling when danger approaches. During the mating season, a pair will leave the flock and find a tree cavity to call home until their chicks mature.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Moustached parakeets can make adorable pets when hand-fed as babies and properly socialized. They are active, social creatures who love to spend time playing games and spend time with their owners.</p><p>Some owners of moustachedparakeets report that their birds tend to act bossy or needy.

If handled often and gently, it may warm to more cuddling.</p><p>While moustachedparakeets are highly intelligent and very trainable, some owners report aggression issues. This behavior usually results from inadequate socialization. Moustachedparakeets tend to choose a favorite person and bond strongly with them while acting out toward other people and pets.</p><p>Like other Asiatic species, they also go through a period of aggressive bluffing behaviorbiting and territorialduring their adolescence. Because of this and their need for extra attention, they may not be the best""beginner"" bird species, though some birders differ in opinion.</p><p>Known to be excellent talkers (especially the males), these birds will reward their owners with many years of comical companionship if adequately cared for.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>While all parrots will make a certain amount of noise, moustachedparakeets are one of the quieter species in terms of screaming and squawking. Many owners report that the birds would much rather talk or whistle pleasantly than bellow ear-piercing screams. For this reason, a moustachedparakeet may be the right choice for those who wanta parrotbut would prefer a quieter bird.</p><h2>MoustachedParakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Moustached parakeets display a rainbow of colors in their beautiful plumage.

Both have gray skin on their feet.</p><p>Some color mutations appear from time to time; birds might have more blue or turquoise in their plumage.</p><h2>Caring fora MoustachedParakeet </h2><p>As pet birds, moustached parakeets are not as common as some other species, though they are becoming more popular. They are often only available through specialty breeders.</p><p>At the minimum, this bird requires a small macaw cage3 feet by 2 feet by 3 feet. Two individuals should not share a cage, and different genders together can also be a problem. Females tend to dominate males.</p><p>These birds are inquisitive and will always want to know what you're doing. They are explorers. If left unattended outside of their cage, they may end up in a part of your home you don't want them in. It's best to have a perch nearby and bring the bird back to it whenever it strays. This bird enjoys perching on shoulders and wants to be part of the action.</p><p>If you are interested in a pet for the whole family, a moustachedparakeet may not be the best choiceit's more a one-person pet. However, if you are a single person or otherwise intend to be the bird's sole caretaker, then this bird could very well be the most loyal companion you will ever have.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, this bird eats fruits, seeds, and blossoms. As with all parrots, it is essential to feed pet moustachedparakeets a varied diet that includes a high-quality commercial pellet formula and seed mixture, as well as a range of fresh foods.</p><p>Feed approximately 1/4 cup of pelleted food and 1//4 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily.A raw and varied diet will help ensure that your bird maintains top nutrition.

All lovebirds belong to the genusand the order Psittaciformes, making them small parrots. While there are several lovebirdspeciesin the world, not all of them are kept as pets.</p><p>In total, there are nine species of lovebirds. The most common to be kept aspets are the Fischer's lovebird, black-masked lovebird, andpeach-facedlovebird. These three popular pet species can make charming and loving companions for a bird lover, and you don't necessarily need a pair of lovebirds to keep them happy.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Fischer's lovebird, black-masked lovebird, yellow-collared lovebird, peach-faced lovebird</p><p>Scientific Name: ,,</p><p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years, potentially more with great care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>With the exception of the Madagascar lovebirda native to that islandall lovebird species call the African continent home. They tend to live in small flocks.</p><p>In the wild, the Fischer's, Nyasa, andblack-cheekedlovebird populations are a cause for concern. Though they are not yet on the endangered species list, their numbers are so low that each falls into one of the ""near-threatened"" or ""vulnerable"" categories.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Lovebirds can be described as active, curious, feisty, and playful, so they definitely pack a lot of personality into a small package. They arevery social birds that form deep bonds with their owners and can be very cuddly birds as a result of this.</p><p>Lovebirds can also be very territorial, aggressive, and jealous if not properly tamed and worked with from a young age. Some experts believe female lovebirds are more prone to jealousy and territoriality than males, but birds of both sexes can have wonderful personalities.</p><p>While not asloud as some larger parrots, lovebirds can still produce a loud, high-pitched screech, especially when they're seeking your attention. Their normal chirps and squawks are not overly loud, but they do like to chatter.</p><p>As a general rule, they are not known for their ability tomimic speech or sounds, although there are always exceptions to the rule. Some experts say females are more apt to mimic sounds or speech than males but both sexes have the potential to chatter.</p><h2>LovebirdColors and Markings </h2><p>Lovebirds are known for their short and rather blunt tail feathers. Beyond size, this is one of the primary features that distinguish them from budgerigars. Lovebirds also have a stockier build.</p><p>The colors that these species come incan vary widely from peach to teal to white to green. They all tend to be rather vivid with heads and faces of a different color than the main body feathers. Many of the popular pet lovebirds have mostly green plumage.</p><p>Various color mutations exist in several species of lovebirds as well. This is particularly true of the peach-faced lovebird, the most popular to be kept as a pet. It is easy to breed in captivity and this has been done for hundreds of years, so you will find many color variations.</p><p>The Absynian, Madagascar, and red-faced lovebirds are dimorphic, making it is easy to tell the males and females apart by the color of their feathers. It is difficult to distinguish the sexes of the other species because they are monomorphic and nearly identical.</p><p>Some lovebird species have a prominent white eye ring, which is characteristic of parrots. The peach-faced and Swindern's lovebirds lack this feature.</p><p>The bill of the lovebird is hooked and its color varies by species, from bold orange-reds to pale beige. Their feet are , meaning two toes point forward and two toes point toward the rear. This helps with agility and gives them a better grasp on branches.</p><h2>Caring for Lovebirds </h2><p>Regular handling and training are needed to maintain a tame lovebird. Purchasing a hand-raised fledgling will make taming your new lovebird easier, but with a little time and patience, you can tame any bird. If you're getting an older lovebird, try to find one that has been handled regularly and has some training to make things easier for yourself.</p><p>A common misconception about keeping lovebirds is that they should always be kept in pairs. Plenty of single lovebirds do fine without a mate as long as they receive enough attention and social interaction from their owners.</p><p>That being said, lovebirds are flock animals so they really do thrive when they feel that they are part of a flock and have their own kind to communicate with. If you are short on time to spend with your lovebird, it is especially important to get him or her a companion.</p><h2>Feeding Lovebirds </h2><p>Lovebirds, like other parrots, should be fed a variety of foods. Wild birds feed on fruits, grasses, seeds, and vegetables, and a pet lovebird's diet should be just as diverse.</p><p>A good pelleted bird food shouldbe the basis of the diet. You can supplement that with a variety of fresh foods and some seeds. Seeds should make up about 5 percent of the total diet.</p><p>Try to rotate the kinds of fresh foods you offer. Just keep in mind that it may take your lovebird a little time to adjust to any new things, including food. A cuttlebone bird treat can be provided in the cage for extra calcium.</p><h2>Cages </h2><p>As a bare minimum, you will need a cage that is at least two feet wide by two feet long and two feet tall. However, a larger cage is always better.</p><p>If you can provide a larger cage, focus more on the length rather than the height. This will ensure that your lovebird can spread its wings and even fly across the cage some.</p><p>Bar spacing should be no more than 1/2 to 5/8 inch and should be oriented horizontally to allow the birds to climb the sides of the cage. Avoid round cages,as they are more likely to damage tail feathers. Provide a variety of perch sizes and materials (including natural branches if possible) to keep your lovebird's feet healthy and strong, as well.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like all parrots, lovebirds are quite active and playful. They'll do best withplenty of interaction and playtime. Giving them attention every day will also strengthen your bond and prevent unwanted behavior.</p><p>It is a good idea to have lots of toys on hand and to rotate them throughout the cage to keep these birds occupied. Make sure all toys are zinc and lead-free and that there are no loose threads on cloth that may entangle your lovebird's toes or in their beak.</p><p>Lovebirds can beaggressive chewers so keep this in mind when choosing toys. Make sure there are no small parts that can be chewed off and ingested. You should also avoid clips, loose strings, and other small parts in which your bird could get its beak, feet, or head trapped.</p><p>Safe toys include wood, sisal, leather, acrylic, and paper toys, as well as bells and ladders. Household items such as empty cardboard tubes from paper towel rolls, paper cups, ink-free cardboard, and dried pasta shapes may also be used by your lovebird.</p>",1153

It is a brilliant, multicolored bird with vibrant plumage. Its shyness with humans makes it a favorite bird for those who enjoy looking at birds but do not want to handle them. This finch is very social with birds of its kind. A small group of these diminutive birds makes for an excellent display in a large enclosure.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Gouldian finch, Gould's finch, rainbow finch, Lady Gouldian finch, painted finch</p><p>Scientific Name: </p><p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 6 to 8 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Gouldian finch is native to the grasslands of Australia. British ornithologist John Gould named the bird the ""Lady Gouldian Finch"" for his wife Elizabeth in 1841. The beautiful little finch was imported to Europe six years later and quickly became a favorite among bird enthusiasts.</p><p>The heavy demand for these pet birds led to widespread trapping and export from Australia until the late 1960s.

But, of the finch species, Gould's finches are one of the calmest finches, so with enough persistence, you might be able to get them to come to you.</p><p>While inches are not affectionate with humans, they do appreciate being with other finches. They thrive on social interaction, and it is best to keep Gouldian finches in pairs or small flocks. Finches are monogamous and mate for life.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Gouldian finches do not sing complicated songs. They make a persistent musical peeping sound that is unlikely to disturb you or annoy neighbors. Gouldian finches are relatively quiet birds and their low, chirping vocalization is pleasant to the ear.Gouldian finches are not known to mimic human speech.</p><h2>Gouldian Finch Colors and Markings </h2><p>Gouldian finches are arguably the most beautiful of the finch family. Both males and females display brilliant plumage in blue, purple, yellow, red, black, and green with some variations. Males tend to display more vivid coloring than femalesthis is common among many bird species.</p><p>Generally, finches fit into categories based on the color of their heads. For example, they are called black-headed, red-headed, and yellow-headed, among other types. These head color variations are most common in captive-bred birds; in the wild, most Gouldian finches have black heads.</p><h2>Caring for the Gouldian Finch </h2><p>Gouldian finches are popular choices in families with children or the elderly in the home, and those who live in apartments or condominiums. Since they stay in the cages, there is little threat of harming these delicate birds.</p><p>These birds usually live in small aviary settings with different finch species, especially society finches and zebra finches. Gouldian finches seem content in an aviary with live plants.</p><p>Overall, Gouldian finches are rather sensitive birds that may not be the best choice for first-time bird owners. They can get easily stressed and are susceptible to ailments. Gouldian finches are susceptible to cold and require a temperature of between 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Gouldian finches are susceptible toair-sac mite infection, especially if they are stressed. They are also prone to scaly face, which is caused by a mite that affects the skin around the beak, eyes, and legs. Any infections require immediate attention from an experienced avian veterinarian. If your finch develops overgrown nails or beak, seek the help of a bird groomer or vet.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, Gouldian finches eat grass seeds and insects. In captivity, Gouldian finches seem to do best on a seed-basedor pellet dietsupplemented with fresh fruits and vegetables daily. Feed them first thing in the morning, and try again at dusk. Fruits and vegetables should make up at least half of the food offered to your finches. Theyeatup to 35 percent of their bodyweight each day.</p><p>Hard vegetables and fruits such as carrots, squash, and unripe pears should be finely chopped or grated. Greens can be left whole or chopped. Dandelion greens are a particular favorite of finches. Any fresh foods that you place in your Amazon's cage should be taken away when feeding time is over.</p><p>Provide a cuttlebone inside of the cage for added calcium. The birds also use the cuttlebone to maintain their beak and nails.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like all finches, Gouldian finches are active birds and need space to fly. Clipping your bird's wings is not recommended, as finches have a very high metabolic rate and flying helps them get ample exercise to burn energy. Since most Gouldian finches reject human interaction, out-of-cage flight time is not an option.</p><p>Be prepared to purchase the largest flight cage you can. Expect that this bird will spend its entire life in its cage. A large cage gives them access to free flight whenever they want. Flight cages often take up as much space as a larger parrot cage. The cage should be at least 3 to 4 square feet for a per pair of finches.</p><p>Finches need toys and perches in their cage to properly exercise and socialize. Purchase small, chewable toys made of hard plastic. These birds are not strong chewers, so the toys will likely last long. Provide different-sized perches or branches; it enables the birds to stretch out their feet.</p><p>Finches enjoy flitting around in the water, so put a shallow bath dish with fresh water at the bottom of the cage three days a week.</p><p>Low maintenance, does not require exercise period</p><p>Quiet, good for apartment dwellers</p><p>Beautiful, ideal for ornamental display</p><p>Requires a large flight cage</p><p>Will need a companion bird</p><p>Does not bond with its owners or like to be handled</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Gouldian Finch </h2><p>Breeding is best left to professionals, as these birds are inattentive parents. If you're going the breeder route, ensure that the breeder is reputable by asking them how long they've been breeding the birds and take a tour of the facility. Make sure the cages are clean, the birds are fed a varied diet, and the breeder is knowledgeable and receptive to your questions. Signs of a healthy bird include bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops. It should appear alert and active. You will pay at least $100 for a Gouldian finch; some color mutations cost much more.</p>",1103

Sometimes mistaken for budgies, lineolated parakeets or ""linnies"" are a bit stockier. And, unlike budgies, these birds enjoy walking about as much as they do flying. Linnies like to walk and perch with their bodies almost parallel or horizontal to the ground, while budgies sit or stand upright. These birds also love to play in the water.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Lineolated parakeet, barred parakeet, Catherine parakeet, linnie</p><p>Adult Size: 6 to 7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 years on average in captivity but can reach 20 years with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Lineolated parakeets of various subspecies live in the wilds of Mexico, Central America, and South America. These birds reside in higher-elevation cloud forests and dense rain forests in mountainous areas like the Peruvian Andes. They forage at lower elevations during the winter. In the wild, they live in flocks of up to 20 birds.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>When properly cared for and hand-fed as babies,lineolatedparakeets develop charming and even-tempered personalities. They are incredibly social birds by nature, and they love to spend time with (and sitting on) their owners. About the same size as a budgie or lovebird, it usually has a calmer disposition than either bird.</p><p>Known to make comical little pets, the highly sociallineolatedparakeet makes a very entertaining family member, always eager to spend time playing with its human flockmates.Anyone interested in adopting one of these birds should make sure that they have plenty of time to spend interacting with their new pet, aslineolatedparakeets bore easily and need ample daily playtime.</p><p>A lineolated parakeet's natural call is soft and almost song-like. This intelligent species can learn to talk and whistle. Since it is a quieter species, you can keep a lineolated parakeet in an apartment or similar housing where you have close neighbors.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These playful birds are quieter than most parakeetsthey tend to chatter rather than screech and can be very able talkers, enunciating clearly, though with a more limited vocabulary than other parrots. These birds are very good at mimicking sounds and whistles.</p><h2>Lineolated Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Lineolated parakeets in the wild display mostly green feathers overlaid with black and dark green stripes on their backs, wings, and sides. The undersides of the wings are blue and the tail feathers are dark green. They have horn-colored beaks and brown eyes. Captive-bred lineolated parakeets can display an array ofcolor mutationsthe feathers change color after leaving the wildincluding blue, cobalt, turquoise, and white.</p><p>Male and females are nearly identical, although careful observers may notice that the black stripes are more numerous on males.</p><h2>Caring for the Lineolated Parakeet </h2><p>This is a small bird that doesn't require a huge cage, although bigger is always better. For a single lineolated parakeet, the bare minimum is a 24-inch square cage, provided you are giving the bird ample outside-the-cage time each day. These birds also do quite well in aviary environments with other linnies or related small species, but be aware that small flocks may be a bit noisy.</p><p>Although they are not notorious for damage, lineolated parakeets, like all parrot species, will chew and gnaw, so provide your bird with plenty of acceptable chew toys and natural wood branches that will help it distinguish when chewing is acceptable.</p><p>Your lineolated parakeet should be allowed out of his cage to interact with the family for several hours each day. These birds like to walk about on furniture and floors, and some owners report that the birds like to burrow under blankets and fabrics.</p><p>Like other parrots, the lineolated parakeet can go through a problematic adolescent period where they attack and bite, but this soon passes and is generally not much of a problem, as the birds aren't large enough to do severe damage. This adolescent period soon passes and gives way to an adorable pet.</p><p>The nails on a lineolated parakeet grow quite fast and will need regular trimming. As it is a rainforest bird, linnies love to bathe in a standing water dish. They enjoy weekly or even daily showers with a spray bottle filled with luke-warm water. Make sure your bird can preen and dry off in a space that is not drafty.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Lineolated parakeets and budgies are susceptible to some of the same diseases as other parrot species, and these are often fatal in such small birds where treatment is difficult.</p><p>However, many other problems with small parrots such as linnies and budgies can be vitamin deficiencies, which can be treated and prevented by making sure the diet is varied and includes fresh fruit and vegetables, not just seeds.</p><p>Parakeets are especially prone to fatty tumors, and many experts recommend feeding these small birds sprouted seeds as a preventive measure.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In thewild, this bird eats various seeds, fruits, insects, and larvae. As with anyhookbillspecies kept as a pet, it is essential to make sure that captivelineolatedparakeets are fed a diet of high-quality seed and pellet mix, along with a variety of bird-safefresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p>A bird will eat up to 1 tablespoon of food per day. Offer fresh fruits and vegetables every other day, along with its seed and pellet mix. Also, provide more vegetables than fruits. Fruits can sometimes cause digestive issues. If you notice watery feces, cut back on the frequency of the fruits.</p><p>Lineolated parakeets enjoy fresh sproutsand spray millet. Offer calcium in the form of a cuttlebone or amineral block.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Lineolated parakeets are very active birds that spend a lot of energy in the wild playing and interacting with their flockmates, foraging for food, and making sure that predators are not targeting them.</p><p>In general, a lineolated parakeet needs 3 to 4 hours of out-of-cage playtime per day to get sufficient exercise.

It's stunning bright-red color makes the Red Lory an exceptionally beautiful companion bird. Red Lories are playful and fun to be around, but they require specialized care to ensure they thrive. Although new bird owners might be enchanted by the Red Lory, this species is often better suited for experienced bird owners. The main requirement for Red Lory ownership is a dedication to meeting this bird's needs, both physically and emotionally. The Red Lory is one of the most popular Lories kept by bird fanciers, second only to the Rainbow Lory.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Red Lory, Moluccan Lory, Moluccan Red Lory</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:10 to 12 inches long. About 6 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy:Up to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Red Lory is a small red parrot belonging to thefamily. Lories, also known as Lorikeets, are a type of small parrot in the commonly found in Australia nearby islands like New Guinea and Indonesia. The Red Lory is related to the Rainbow Lory, or Rainbow Lorikeet. Red Lories breed readily in captivity and are easily found in pet stores and bird specialty stores. The Red Lory originated in Indonesia, specifically the Maluku Islands (also known as the Moluccas). This is why the Red Lory is sometimes referred to as the Moluccan Lory.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Red Lories are outgoing and cheerful birds, entertaining their owners with their clownish antics and play. These mischievous birds are intelligent and always looking for their next adventure, so it behooves you to keep a close eye on them when they are out of the cage. Hand-raising and hand-feeding young Red Lories will help them grow accustomed to human touch, making them more accepting of handling. Although they are affectionate and enjoy human interaction and handling, they might occasionally nip. The Red Lory might be happiest as the only bird in the house. They crave human interaction and play, so anyone considering a Red Lory must be prepared to provide a lot of daily attention and affection.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Red Lories are quite vocal, chatting, squawking and screeching all day long. They can also readily learn and repeat back words, an activity that can be great fun. The Red Lory is a very loud bird. It's best kept by someone who appreciates a talkative pet.</p><h2>Red LoryColors and Markings </h2><p>The body of theRed Loryis deep red. It has splashes of blue on its wings. and a white face and chest and belly.Male and femaleRed Lorieslook identical, so it's not possible to determine sex based on appearance.</p><h2>Caring for theRed Lory </h2><p>The Red Lory is extremely active, so it should be housed in as large an enclosure as possible to ensure it has lots of space to fly, climb and play when inside its cage. Lots of time outside the cage is also essential for these playful and social birds. Ideally, choose an enclosure that is at least24 inches deep by 36 incheswide and 36 inches tall. Choose a cage that's easy to clean (something you can hose down is ideal). Red Lories are quite messy because their high-liquid diets result in lots of liquid droppings. You might want to lay plastic down under the cage to help contain the projectile poop.</p><p>You can purchase a commercial nest box or make your own. Provide a variety of perches in different shapes and sizes, taking care to ensure they are not above food or water sources to prevent contamination with feces. Ropes and chains for climbing are essential. Toys are also important for Red Lories. They love to play so provide many different toyslike swings, blocks, mirrors and bellsmade of many different materials, such as sisal, cotton, leather and wood. Toys that rattle or ring are also favorites. Make sure your toys are sturdy so they hold up. Routinely rotate your Red Lory's toys to keep them interesting and enticing.</p><p>Red Lories require daily baths. You can simply mist the bird with a water bottle or let them play in a shallow bath, which doubles as great playtime for the bird.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The Red Lory may be prone to developing hemochromatosis. This potentially fatal metabolic disorder, which is also called iron storage disease, causes an over-accumulation of iron in the tissues of the body.</p><p>Red Lories can also suffer the consequences of a poor or inappropriate diet (for example, seed is not an appropriate diet for Red Lories). Always consult with an avian veterinarian to make sure your Red Lory is not suffering from nutritional deficiencies.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>The Red Lory has very unique dietary requirements. The Red Lory feeds mainly on nectar; it's tongue has a brush-like tipspecifically designed for this purpose. In fact, Lories are sometimes called brush-tongued parrots. Red Lories also enjoy soft, very ripe fruits and some vegetables.</p><p>In the wild, Red Lories get their nectar from flowers. Red Lories that are kept as pets eat commercial nectars intended to replicate their diet in the wild. Commercial nectars come as a dry powder and must be mixed fresh at least twice a day. To prevent spoilage, uneaten nectar should be discarded after a few hours and replaced with fresh nectar at the next feeding. Uneaten fresh fruits should also be discarded after a few hours and replaced with new fruit at the next feeding. Fresh water should be available at all times.</p><p>The Red Lory's diet of nectar is very wet and Red Lories have short digestive tracts. This means Red Lory poops are also very wet and copiouseven projectile. Messy poops (lots of them) are a reality of living with a Loryboth inside and outside of their cage. However, the good news is Red Lories are extremely intelligent. Some owners have had luck training their Red Lories to poop in a specific spot on command to help contain the mess.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Red Lories are always moving, so they get plenty of exercise in their day-to-day play.

They are popular for their vibrant, colorful plumage, and they are generally peaceful and quiet. As pets, they tend to have a sweet disposition. They are small, do not require a large footprint of your space, and can be tame, affectionate birds if they get a lot of one-on-one time with you.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Scarlet-chested parakeets, splendid parakeets, scarlet-breasted parrots, or orange-throated parrots</p><p>Adult Size: 8 inches in length, about 2.5 ounces in weight</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10 to 15 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>This bird species is a type of grass parakeet that is native to Southern and Western Australia and New South Wales. In nature, they feed on the ground and fly low, keeping close to cover. They thrive in a variety of climates, including dry interior areas, eucalyptus woodland, arid sparse growth, and forest edges. They also travel around the land from one water source to another, often in large flocks.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>For many years, scarlet-chested parakeets were considered by most to be an ""ornamental"" bird, basically meaning that they should be seen and not touched. This is a false characterization, since most scarlet-chested parakeets are tame, loving pets. However, these birds are among the more temperamental types of parakeets that may not enjoy handling as much as other types of birds.</p><p>You can train a scarlet-chested parakeet to be comfortable with handling. Except for some outliers, it is not a bird known for doing tricks or talking.</p><p>Scarlet-chested parakeets can make excellent companions for the right people. With time, patience, and proper bonding techniques, they can be loving and affectionate pets that can be socially involved with their owners.</p><p>Scarlet-chested parakeets prefer to softly chatter among themselves rather than resort to screams and loud contact calls.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>When they do make their calls, the sound is soft, melodious, and in two-syllable notes. In a flock, they produce light, continuous twittering. They emit clear, sharper whistles when alarmed. Like many small birds, they are receptive to songs, music, and whistling.</p><h2>Scarlet-Chested Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Scarlet-chested parakeets exhibit a brilliant rainbow of colors in their plumage. They are a sexually dimorphic species, so males and females are colored differently.</p><p>Mature male scarlet-chested parakeets have dark blue faces, red chests, and bright green on their backs and the tops of their heads. They have yellow bellies and sky blue feathers on the undersides of their wings.</p><p>Although mature females also have blue faces, green wings and backs, and green chests, their head has less blue and more brown. Their chest and wings are green, and their abdomen and thighs are bright yellows. Like the males, they also have yellow feathers on their bellies.</p><h2>Caring for the Scarlet-Chested Parakeet </h2><p>Relatively quiet and small as far as parrots go, these birds can be an ideal pet if you live in an apartment or condominium. The cage should be about 4 feet long by 2 feet wide and 2 feet deep. The bars should be no more than 1/2-inch apart. They can get along with most other peaceful small birds like finches and budgies and can be housed in the same cage or aviary if there is enough space for all the birds.</p><p>Scarlet-chested parakeets prefer warm, dry climate. They are uncomfortable in humid and damp conditions and cannot handle extreme temperatures.</p><p>These birds prefer taking abath in standing water or on wet foliage. Keep a small clean bowl of bathing water inside the cage.They also like to sunbathe by puffing out their feathers and bending their wings.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>As scarlet-chested parakeets are accustomed to staying in dry places, they might suffer from respiratory problems when exposed to extreme cold and humidity.</p><p>Scarlet-chested parrots are vulnerable toinfections. As prevention, remove everything from their diet that encourages fungal growth, like refined flour and sugar (most ripe fruits). Add natural antifungals to their diet like fresh crushed garlic, oregano, thyme, and rosemary.</p><p>As with most other parrots, they may start tofeather pluck or self-mutilateif they do not have enough room in their cage or if not given flight time outside of the cage.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Scarlet-chested parakeets in the wild regularly eat a diet consisting mainly of grasses and seeds found in the fields where they live. Their diet is supplemented by other offerings available throughout the seasons, including flowers, fruit, insects, and berries.</p><p>In captivity, they seem to do quite well on seed mixes formulated for small parrots or parakeets with supplementation of canary seed and sunflower seed. They also enjoy and thrive on sprouts and leafy greens like spinach and kale. Offer these fresh vegetables daily, as well as bits of fruits like apple, banana, and orange. Cuttlebone is another recommended offering. It contains a variety of proteins, and more importantly, calcium.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Scarlet-chested parakeets spend a lot of time on the ground foraging for food in the wild. To emulate this behavior in captivity, provide plenty of foot toys. The toys keep the bird engaged and active. You can also put some soil and grass at the bottom of the cage to let it scratch around. Hang small, wooden branches, perches, and swings in the cage to keep them busy throughout the day. Provide a secure, bird-proof area where they can play in a safe area outside of their cages, supervised, for 3 to 4 hours per day.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Does not take up too much space</p><p>Relatively quiet for a parrot, good for apartment dwellers</p><p>Can be temperamental, needs time to warm up to you</p><p>Requires three to four hours daily of supervised exercise</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Scarlet-Chested Parakeet </h2><p>If you're interested in learning more about whether or not a scarlet-chested parakeet would be a good addition to your family, the best thing to do is contact your local aviculture societyor a nearby scarlet-chested parakeet breeder.

They are quiet birds that are ideal apartment dwellers and are equally suited for individual cages or small aviaries, where they are excellent partners for finches and cockatiels as well as other Bourke's parakeets. Keep gentle Bourke's parakeets away from larger, aggressive birds.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Bourke's parrots, Bourke's parakeet, Bourkies, blue-vented parrot, sundown parrot, and pink-bellied parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 7 to 8 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: May live as long as 25 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Bourke's parakeet is a nomadic species native to Australia. Their habitat spans much of the continent including Queensland; New South Wales; and central, southern, and western Australia. Their principal habitat is the dry plains, but they also live in native cypress and eucalyptus woodlands. Wild birds also live in urban areas.</p><p>These birds are named for Sir Richard Bourke, the governor of Australia's New South Wales territory from 1831 to 1837. It was initially classified as part of the genusbut was assigned to the genus in the 1990s.</p><p>Successful captive breeding programs have made Bourke's parakeets popular pets in homes all over the world. This species is not threatened; wild populations seem to be growing.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Known as an adorable, gentle, and good-natured species, Bourke's parakeets make good pets when hand-fed as babies, which allows them to bond with their human caretakers.</p><p>These are intelligent birds but are also mellow and quiet, especially compared to other parrot species. They are cuddly and prefer companionship; expect a guest riding on your shoulder often. They also get bouts of energy and enjoy flying around.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Peak activity usually occurs just after sunrise and sunset, when they can get a bit noisy, though not annoyingly so. Overall, these are relatively quiet birds when compared to other parrots. Unlike other parrots, Bourke's parakeets do not talk or perform tricks.</p><h2>Bourke's Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>While not as vividly colored as other species, Bourke's parakeets are still quite eye-catching. They have a dusty brown tint to their plumage with pink feathers covering their chests and abdomens, and blue tail feathers. The backs of their wings display a darker brownish-gray hue with each feather highlighted by a lighter-colored outline.</p><p>The sexes can be distinguished visuallythey are sexually dimorphic. The adult male has a blue forehead while the adult female has little or no blue on the forehead. The male also tends to be slightly larger than the female.</p><p>Several color mutations are possible with Bourke's parakeets. One of the most popular is the rosy Bourke's parakeet, which is a bright shade of pink.</p><h2>Caring for Bourke's Parakeets </h2><p>These birds are enthusiastic flyers, so they are better suited for roomy aviaries rather than cages. A suitable aviary is at least 6 feet in length with several tree branches for the birds to climb.</p><p>If an aviary is not a practical possibility, choose the largest cage possible, with dimensions that are wider than they are tall, as these birds enjoy horizontal flight. A cage should be at least three feet long, 1 1/2 feet wide, and 1 1/2 feet tall. This bird is best suited caged with another Bourke's parakeet; althoughthey can live well on their own. If kept single, interact with it daily to curb loneliness. Swings are an excellent addition to an aviary or cage.</p><p>Bourke's parakeets are enthusiastic bathers, so make sure to keep bathing pools inside the cage or aviary. Make sure the bathing water is fresh and clean. You can also spray the bird with lukewarm water for an enjoyable activity for the bird.</p><p>Parakeets are incredibly social birds, and Bourke's parakeet is no exception. Although less demanding than some other species, your bird needs at least two hours of interaction and training each day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like other parrot species, Bourke's parakeet can be prone to psittacosis, which can be spread between birds and humans. This bacterial disease causes respiratory problems; it is treatable with antibiotics. A number of viruses can also strike parakeets, that can cause feather problems, diarrhea, and pneumonia.</p><p>Parakeets are also prone to sinus congestion caused by the fungus; proper nutrition and hygiene will prevent this problem.</p><p>Several parasites can affect parakeets. Intestinal parasites may cause a bird to lose weight and become depressed, while external mites and lice will cause the bird to scratch and lose feathers.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Bourke's parakeets are grass parakeets, which means that they forage for food among the fields and plains. Wild Bourke's parakeets consume a diet based mainly on seed, grasses, and different plant matter, supplemented withfruits, berries, insects, and other types of food when available.</p><p>A Bourke's parakeet in captivity needs a balanced meal daily.

However, not everyone is well suited to care for one of these birds, especially considering that they can live for 30 years or more. The smallest of the eight pionus species, it is feisty for a pionus, but still laid back compared to other parrots, like Amazons, macaws, or cockatoos.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: White-capped pionus, white-cap pionus, white-crowned pionus, white-crowned parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 9 to 10 inches, head to tail; weighing between 7 and 8 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The white-capped pionus is native to the forests and woodlands of Central America and Mexico. Usually, they live in forests and dense growth, nesting in hollow tree trunks and palms. Found in flocks of about one dozen birds, these are mostly silent and peaceful creatures.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>White-capped pionus are known to be feisty and comical, as well as sweet, affectionate little birds. They are brilliant and take well to training when their owners are patient and consistent. These parrots thrive when given social interaction and mental stimulation from playing and learning tricks.</p><p>These birds tend to get shy around strangers. Around their owners, they like to hang out on their shoulders or arms, dancing, playing, and waiting for a chance to make a game out of stealing items like pens or buttons. They tend to get attached to a single person whom they trust the most.</p><p>You will have to keep a close eye on this bird when it is out of the cage. It has a notoriously curious nature and can get into trouble if not closely supervised.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Like other pionus parrots, the white-capped birds have a reputation for being slightly quieter than other hookbill parrots and make a great apartment bird. However, a houseful of screaming children, barking dogs, and blaring televisions can easily teach the sedatepionusto be noisy.</p><p>They do have the ability to talk, but often clam up around those they aren't familiar with. Pionusare not the best talkers, but some have an impressive vocabulary. Their speaking voice isn't always crystal clear and is often a little raspy, but an owner can generally make out what their bird is saying. Usually, they will learn a few simple words like their name, the name of people in the house, and will repeat more common sounds like whistles, whispers, beeps, and animal sounds.</p><h2>White-Capped Pionus Colors and Markings </h2><p>Compared to adults, juvenile white-capped pionus are dull and dingy looking. As young birds, this feature helps keep them camouflaged from predators in the wild.</p><p>Like the name suggests, the top of their head is pure white with another little white spot under their chin.Mature adult white-capped pionus are mostly green and dark blue. These colors cover the majority of their head, throat, chest, belly, and back. It has yellow-green patches on their shoulders, and as with all pionus, red feathers on the underside of their tails.</p><p>The white-capped pionus is a monomorphic species, meaning it is impossible to tell males from the females based on looks alone. This bird requires a genetics test or a surgical sexing procedure to determine sex.</p><h2>Caring for the White-Capped Pionus </h2><p>Cages used to house Amazons are suitable for white-capped pionus parrots. Consider a cage that is at least 4 feet tall and 4 feet long by 2 feet wide. Bar spacing should be no larger than 3/4-inch.</p><p>Pionusparrotsmight make a wheezing sound when frightenedor excited, which an owner might mistake for a medical condition.Pionusalso give off a musky or sweet odor that some caretakers find unpleasant, but others like.</p><p>Ensure they get a bath regularly, and don't hesitate to take them with you in the shower.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Pionusparrots are susceptible to fungal infections, visceral gout (a kidney infection), and aspergillosis, which is indicated by heavy, difficult breathing. They may also be prone to vitamin A deficiency.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In thewild, pionus parrotseatfruits, berries, seeds, blossoms, and corn. In captivity, white-capped pionus should be fed a high-quality seed and pellet mix, along with a variety of fresh foods like bird-safe fruits and vegetables. White-capped pionus love eating corn, particularly corn on the cob, so make sure to make it a regular snack for these lovely birds.</p><p>Occupying your bird with new foods is not only nutritionally beneficial, but it also offers essential mental stimulation for your feathered friend. You can give them an unlimited amount of pellet food; they will only eat what they need. As for fresh fruits and veggies, offer about a 1/8 to 1/4 cup in the morning and at night.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>All pionus parrots are active birds and need 3 to 4 hours of exercise outside of the cage every day to stay healthy. If you cannot provide outside-of-cage time, this bird will need a massive cage or aviary to get ample exercise.</p><p>This exercise should occur in a safe, bird-proofed area with windows closed, ceiling fans turned off, and other indoor animals removed. Supervise playtime to make sure that your bird does not get into anything that could be toxic or otherwise harmful. A playpen is ideal for outside-of-cage play.Playthings can include climbing ropes, chains, bells, parrot swings, and wooden or other bird toys.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Intelligent, can say a few words and can learn tricks</p><p>Quieter species of parrot</p><p>Not a fan of strangers; tends to be a one-person bird</p><p>Requires at least 3 to 4 hours of outside-of-cage exercise</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a White-capped Pionus </h2><p>Before bringing this bird home, visit with local bird breeders or an aviculture society in your area. Speak to people who have experience raising these birds. Observe the birds and learn firsthand what it's like to live with a white-capped pionus on a day-to-day basis. White-cappedpionusare typically available from bird breeders and some avian specialty stores. They are occasionally available from avian rescue organizations. These birds can cost about $400 to $900.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that thebreeder is reputableby asking them how long they've been breeding white-capped pionus parrots. Carefully inspect a bird before taking it home. Ahealthy birdis alert, active, has bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1022

The Owl Finch's characteristic black and white markings make it look a lot like a tiny owl. The Owl Finch might not be the most colorful finch, but its unique markings are striking and this finch has sweet and gregarious personality. The easy-to-keep Owl Finch can be a great choice for new bird owners.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names:Owl Finch,Bicheno Finch, Bicheno's Finch, Double-Barred Finch, Double-Bar Finch</p><p>Scientific Name:</p><p>Adult Size:3 to 4 inches long. About 15 to 17 grams (half an ounce)</p><p>Life Expectancy:Up to 10 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Owl Finch is part of a large family of birds known as waxbill, or Estrildid finches. The Estrildidae family is comprised of more than 130 species, including the Owl Finch. Other finches in the Estrildidae family include the Gouldian Finch and the Zebra Finch. In the wild, Owl Finches are found in Australia's woodlands, grasslands and scrublands, where they live in groups.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Playful and curious, the Owl Finch is a charming and entertaining bird to keep. Although highly social with other finches, the Owl Finch in not big on being handled by humans, preferring the close company of other birds. Keeping just one Owl Finch is not recommended. Like most finches, the Owl Finch does better when housed in groups of Owl Fiches in large enclosures, or at the very least, a pair of Owl Finches in a smaller enclosure. Owl Finches can also be kept with other finches in the same family, as well as canaries.</p><p>Owl Finches will readily breed if you keep males and females together. If you prefer not to have baby Owl Finches, you might try to keep all females. However, telling male and female Owl Finches apart is not always an easy task (read more about sexing Owl Finches below under ""Owl Finch Colors and Markings"").</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Owl Finches are quite vocal, chattering the day away. A group of Owl Finches can be somewhat noisy, though the vocalizations are more pleasant than earsplitting. Only the male Owl Finches sing, but they do less frequently than some other finches.</p><h2>Owl Finch Colors and Markings </h2><p>The body of the Owl Finch is light brown. It has dark brown wings with tiny white spots, and a white face and chest and belly. A black band circles around the white face and a similar black band appears below the chest. It's Owl Finch's beak is a beautiful silver-gray and the eyes are black. All together, the markings call to mind those of an owl, lending to one of the breed's common names.</p><p>Male and female Owl Finches look nearly identical, although females might have slightly narrower bands and their chests may be less brilliant white. Such differences are subtle, though, so it's nearly impossible to determine sex based on coloring alone. However, there is a telltale giveaway about the sex of an Owl Finch: Only male Owl Finches sing.</p><h2>Caring for theOwl Finch </h2><p>The Owl Finch is an active species, so it should be housed in a much larger cage than you might expect given its small size. The Owl Finch needs plenty of space to fly around. A large enclosure (at least 2 to 3 three feetthe longer the better) is especially important when keeping two Owl Finches, as is generally recommended. If you're planning on keeping a larger group of birds, bump up your enclosure to an aviary or flight cage.</p><p>Provide several perches and a woven nest basket or box nest with appropriate nesting material like dry grass or shredded paper. You can also include some toys or ladders in the enclosure, but avoid too much excess clutter in the cage, which takes away space for flying about.</p><p>Keep your enclosure in a warm room free from both direct sunlight and drafts. Make sure the room is warm enough for your Owl Finchesa minimum of 60 degrees Fahrenheit.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like most finches, the Owl Finch may be prone to developing air-sac mite infection, a parasitic infection common in birds. Air-sac mite infections affect the respiratory tract. They are very serious, requiring immediate treatment by a veterinarian. Owl Finches are also prone to developing scaly face, another disease involving mites. As with air-sac mites, veterinary treatment is required for scaly face. Finally, Owl Finches may experience egg binding, when a female bird is unable to pass an egg, which can make the bird very sick. Egg binding is common in smaller birds like finches, although it can occur in any bird.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Feed your Owl Finches both high-quality finch seed and a finch pellet food, and supplement with fresh greens, such as spinach, and broccoli tops and carrot tops, and mealworms or grubs for protein. Provide a cuttlebone for calcium and a hanging water bottle (clean and change the water daily).</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Because they do not especially enjoy handling, Owl Finches generally stay in their enclosures. They are active flyers and will get plenty of exercise inside their cage as long as it's large enough. Avoid tall, narrow cages, which don't provide enough horizontal space for flying.</p><p>Easy to care for</p><p>Unique ""owl-like"" look</p><p>Active and entertaining pets</p><p>Do not enjoy handling</p><p>Require large enclosures for flying</p><p> </p><p>Can be somewhat noisy (chattering)</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Owl Finch </h2><p>Owl Finches are often available for sale in pet stores and bird specialty stores. You can also buy Owl Finches from a breeder. Always do your research to ensure the breeder you're interested in buying from is knowledgeable and raises healthy birds in a humane environment. Some bird rescues and even your local animal shelter might also have Owl Finches available for adoption.</p>",945
49,https://www.thesprucepets.com/lutino-bird-species-profile-5120268,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Small Bird Breeds,<h1>Lutino Parakeet: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Lutino Parakeet: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>The lutino is a type of parakeet that belongs to the parrot family. These intelligent and affectionate pets are sometimes called budgies and budgerigars, and come in a wide range of vibrant feather colors and parents. The lutino variation of this species is caused by a specific sex-linked gene mutation that causes its yellow feathers. Because two non-lutino birds are capable of producing lutino babies, it is considered a recessive gene.</p><p>Parakeets are native to Australia, and this particular species is sometimes referred to as the albino or ""yellow albino"" version of the better-known green parakeet.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Lutino parakeet</p><p>Scientific Name: (Parakeet)</p><p>Adult Size:6-7 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy:10 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The lutino was first noted in the early 1800s by an explorer in Australia. In the wild, most parakeets have either green or yellow coloring, and these parakeets were introduced to England in the 1840s. Traders began selling parakeets as pets, and the yellow lutino was born as enthusiasts began breeding the birds to experiment with different colors and patterns.</p><p>Lutinos first officially appeared in the 1930s, and today they continue to be the result of careful breeding and are not commonly found in the wild (their recessive genes would have to resurface). This is good news because their vivid yellow coloring happens to make them easier for their predators to locate.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Parakeets remain the most popular of all companion birds, and for good reason. Much like other species of parakeet, the lutino is a curious, active, and sociable bird that makes a great pet. Of course, that also means they will need ample attention as they can get bored easily when left alone for long periods of time.</p><p>They are playful and friendly, and can also be trained fairly easily. Your lutino parakeet should be able to learn basic commands like ""step up"" or ""step down.""</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These parakeets are friendly and social and can be taught to talk. When providing their daily interaction, you will note that the lutino has a high-pitched yet sweet voice.</p><h2>Lutino Colors and Markings </h2><p>The lutino has lush yellow feathers on its body and head but a paler yellow color on its tail and primary flight feathers. They typically also have silver-white cheek patches and red or pink eyes (their legs and bills also have a reddish tint).</p><h2>Caring for the Lutino Parakeet </h2><p>Despite their unique coloring, lutinos are just like other varieties of parakeets -- they are active birds that love to fly and climb. This means they'll need a fairly large cage of a minimum of 18x18 x24 inches.</p><p>They will of course need fresh food and water every day, and since they are quite interactive, affectionate birds, they do enjoy bonding with their owners--you'll need to spend at least a half-hour with them daily. You should also consider providing an array of toys or other cageaccessories for theseplayful parakeets.</p><p>When finding a home for your lutino's enclosure, be sure to keep them away from doors or windows, as they do not like cold drafts. You'll also want to avoid the kitchen as all parakeets are sensitive to strong odors, gases, and smoke. Try to place the cage at or below eye level. Lutinos that receive the proper care will live to be about 10 (or even up to 15) years old.</p><p>The lutino parakeet is generally considered to require a more advanced understanding of bird handling, as they can be difficult to tame. As such, they may not be the best choice for first-time parakeet (or bird) owners. Like many birds, the lutino can be ""nippy"" and will likely go through what's called a ""bluffing"" stage in their adolescence. With patience and positive, gentle interactions, however, they can be trained to become fantastic companion pets.</p><p>Lastly, parakeets appreciate staying clean, and you'll notice your lutino regularly preening itself. You can offer a warm birdbath a few times a week, or even just a refreshing mist from a spray bottle.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Although the lutino isn't necessarily associated with any specific diseases, they can be susceptible to the health issues that often impact parakeets. These can include fractures, mites, asthma and bronchitis, epilepsy, paratyphosis, and catarrhal inflammation. Many of these conditions can be prevented by providing your bird with a clean and dust-free environment as well as a proper diet and fresh water.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>The lutino prefers a varied diet. Along with their regular bird food, be sure to provide a mix of nuts, vegetables, seeds, and fruits for optimal nutrition. For example, you can offer dark leafy greens and fruits like berries, papaya, and melon (just be sure to aim for about every other day). Other treats might include honey sticks or spray millet. They will also need fresh, clean water every day.</p><p>You'll want to refresh your bird's food bowl daily and aim to keep the bowl about 3/4 full with its regular pelleted food (this should only make up about 15 to 25 percent of their diet). You can also offer a birdseed blend, which should also remain about 3/4 full.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>The lutino parakeet is not a bird that will be content to remain in their cage all day. They love interacting with their owners and climbing, and for optimal health will benefit from daily opportunities to fly.</p><p>Friendly, once you gain their trust</p><p>Active</p><p>Social</p><p>Can Talk</p><p>Can be ""nippy""</p><p>Difficult to tame</p><p>Can't be left alone for long periods of time</p><p>Require a large cage and ample exercise/socialization</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy </h2><p>Lutino parakeets are selectively bred using a very specific gene mutation, so you'll likely have to connect with a local breeder if you're interested in taking one of these yellow parakeets home.</p>",938

They habituate lowland rainforests, coffee plantations, and other arboreal places. They fly in pairs or small groups and nest in tree cavities.</p><p>Jardine parrots are named after naturalist Sir William Jardine who was the first person to describe the bird in 1849 when he brought one home from the Democratic Republic of Congo for his son. The Latin name for the Jardine parrot is also named after this family of Jardine men since the word means ""William's.""</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Jardine parrots have a wonderful reputation for being affectionate and playful. They are not as temperamental as their closely related Amazon parrot relatives, but, as young birds, they can go through a phase where they are more prone to biting than they often are as adults. Jardine parrots are also very smart and can entertain themselves for good periods of time with toys.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These birds can imitate other birds as well as speak very clearly. While they are capable of screaming loudly, they don't do this often. Many Jardine parrots will mimic various noises they hear and learn to say common phrases.</p><h2>Jardine Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Both male and female Jardine parrots have the same colorations. They have a primarily green body, darker green wings, and reddish-orange on the head. A bend in the wings and ankles and bare skin around the eyes is also to be spotted in a typical Jardine.</p><h2>Caring for the Jardine Parrot </h2><p>Jardines can be very destructive so they need to stay busy with toys and get plenty of time outside their cage to play and exercise.</p><p>They don't necessarily need to spend all day with their favorite person, but they do need things to keep them occupied so they don't get bored.</p><p>An aviary is ideal, but a large cage will suffice with enough supervised time outside the enclosure. To keep their beak in check, provide the occasional almond to crack open and consume.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Respiratory issues are the most common type of health problems in pet birds. Drafts can cause a Jardine parrot to catch a cold and develop more serious issues like pneumonia, so it's important for your bird to avoid drastic temperature changes. Aspergillosis, a fungal infection, is another concern for birds and can result from being housed in unsanitary conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>A high quality, pelleted bird diet is ideal for a Jardine parrot, but it should be supplemented with fresh fruits, vegetables, cooked beans, and some seeds like sunflower and spray millet. Healthy treats can be offered on occasion, too, but too many seeds and peanuts can cause obesity and liver problems.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As with any bird, offering the opportunity of flight time is recommended if a safe area can be provided. Cage toppers, ladders, and various sized perches and branches should also be accessible to your Jardine parrot for additional exercise and enrichment.</p><p>Quieter than many parrots</p><p>Usually good-natured</p><p> </p><p>Destructive</p><p>Can scream loudly</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Jardine Parrot </h2><p>Threats to the wild populations are in part due to the illegal pet trade, so for the sake of the species, captive-bred Jardine parrots are the only kind that should be sought as pets. Thankfully, this species breeds regularly in captivity, so finding a Jardine parrot should not be an issue.</p><p>Large speciality pet stores and parrot rescues may be sources where you can find a Jardine parrot.

Their care is like that of other canaries, and they make popular pets for small spaces or for those not keen on the louder pet bird species.</p><p>Knowing more about this specific type of canary can help you provide them with the best care possible.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Gloster canary</p><p>Adult Size: 4.75 inches or smaller</p><p>Life Expectancy: 10-15 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>These birds were named after the Canary Islands in which they were first discovered and were popularized as pets due to their beautiful singing abilities.</p><p>Originating from Gloucestershire, England, but not found in the wild, the gloster canary is a specific type of domestic canary that was originally bred from various other canaries in the early 1920s.</p><p>By 1960, the birds were brought to the United States and breeding and showing grew over the next decade. Then, in 1976, a gloster canary won best in show solidifying its popularity among canary lovers.</p><p>Now it is not unusual to see about 200 gloster canaries competing in a single show.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Canaries are lively little birds but aren't designed to be handled, even though they aren't prone to biting. Although they are an active species, they are delicate and are best left to watch and listen to. They love playing with small bird toys like bells and bird pacifiers and will entertain for hours.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Canaries are primarily known for their singing. Other birds will scream, make chirps, beeps, squawks, and other noises, but the gloster canary has a beautiful song that is more like a whistle.</p><p>It is important to note that females do not typically sing, so you'll want to get a male gloster canary over six months of age if you want to enjoy their vocalizations.</p><h2>Gloster Canary Colors and Markings </h2><p>There are two types of Gloster canaries - coronas and consorts. Corona gloster canaries have a flat, bowl-cut appearance to the feathers on the top of their heads, while consort gloster canaries don't have this unique and eye-catching crest.</p><p>These birds can come in combinations of yellow, brown, white, frost, cinnamon, grey, and green due to the variations in breeding.</p><h2>Caring for the Gloster Canary </h2><p>Like other pet birds, gloster canaries are a social species, so they will want attention and stimulation from their owner.</p><p>A lonely gloster canary will not thrive, nor will one that is kept in too small of an enclosure, but these birds can become territorial if housed with other canaries so it is best to keep them separated.</p><p>Ideally, a canary's cage will allow them to fly and hop around from perch to perch, contain a nest, water dish, bathing bowl, food dish, and toys.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Gloster canaries should be kept away from drafts and any drastic temperature changes to avoid developing respiratory issues.</p><p>Aside from that, they can be prone to air sac, feather and red mites. Scaly face can also be a problem, and if they are housed outdoors, canarypox can be transmitted through mosquitoes.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>A high-quality, pelleted canary diet is best for gloster canaries since seeds do not offer a complete and balanced meal on their own.</p><p>Fruits, vegetables, and millet should be provided in addition to the base diet, especially if seeds are fed.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>An aviary allows a canary to safely exercise and fly, but if a large enclosure like this is not available, some flight indoors in a safe environment should be allowed.</p><p>At the very least, a canary should be housed in a cage that is large enough to allow some flight yet still has small bar spacing.

They are known for being calm and quiet birds so they often make great pets for people in apartments or other small spaces.</p><p>Knowing more about these birds can help you provide the type of care they need to stay healthy and happy.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Meyer's parrot, brown parrot, Sudan brown parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 8-9 inches, about 4 oz.</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20-30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Meyer's parrots are native to Africa and can be found in wild woodlands and grasslands traveling in pairs or small flocks. The largest populations are found in Botswana, but they can also be found in a variety of other countries.</p><p>They were named in honor of the German ornithologist Bernhard Meyer and were first described in 1827.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>These parrots are social, laid back, and observant birds. They can be affectionate and appreciate regular handling with neck scratches without being too demanding for attention. If well-socialized, Meyer's parrots are usually gentle and not considered to be big biters. They are often happy to play with or shred a toy while watching what's going on around them.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>While not big talkers, Meyer's parrots can learn a few words and sounds. The occasional screech may occur, but most of the vocalizations coming from a Meyer's parrot will be mimicked sounds from their environments, along with whistles and clicks.</p><h2>Meyer's Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Meyer's parrots may not be as brightly colored as some other pet birds, but they have their own earthy appeal. A green to turquoise body, greyish black or brown neck and head, brown or black wings and tail, and a little yellow on the wings and head describes both the males and females of this species. Subspecies may have variations of these colors with varying amounts of yellow on the wings and head.</p><h2>Caring for the Meyer's Parrot </h2><p>While all birds require time and attention, Meyer's parrots are relatively low maintenance when it comes to care. A cage with strong bars and plenty of space is, of course, necessary for safekeeping when supervision is not allowed. They also need ample time for exploring and to watch the world around them.</p><p>They are usually quite satisfied with another bird or a human that they can bond with, toys to shred, fresh food, and neck rubs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like most birds living in climates that are not like their native habitats, Meyer's parrots can be prone to getting respiratory issues from drafts and chills as well as unclean environments.</p><p>Pneumonia, aspergillosis, feather mites, liver disease, and viral infections can all affect Meyer's parrots. Regular veterinary care can help detect issues before they become major problems, but prevention is best with a proper diet and clean living space.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Seed mixes are still commonly fed to many birds, but high quality, pelleted bird foods are actually more balanced dietary options for many avian pets, including Meyer's parrots.</p><p>Pelleted diets should still be supplemented with a variety of rotating fresh fruits, vegetables, and the occasional piece of cooked pasta, bread, or sugar-free cereal as treats. Seeds should be the minimal part of the diet instead of the majority.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Meyer's parrots are often happy to destroy a toy and hang out on a perch, but they still need to be allowed time outside their cage. If a safe flight area is available, it's always a good idea to allow a bird to fly, both for its mental state and physical exercise.</p><p>Laid back</p><p>Quiet for a small parrot</p><p>Happy to play with toys by itself for periods of time</p><p>Not as cuddly as some other birds</p><p>Not as brightly colored as some other birds</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Meyer's Parrot </h2><p>Historically, Meyer's parrots were not easily bred in captivity, so this quality combined with having less color than their cousin, the Senegal parrot, made them a less commonly seen pet bird. Now that breeders that focus on this species have been successful, some parrot rescues may have them available for adoption along with speciality bird stores.</p>",673

This specific type of finch is a domesticated bird and was produced in captivity by cross breeding sharp-tailed and munia finches in Asia where they are native. These species spend their time in grasslands and woodlands where they nest in domed grass structures.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Society finches are not birds that are easily handled, but that is because of their small size and not because they are aggressive. Society finches may be easily startled and fly around their enclosures when they aren't nesting or eating, but they are typically peaceful.</p><p>If a finch did attempt to bite you, it is unlikely to deliver more than a peck or little pinch due to their small beak.</p><p>Society finches get their name from their social personalities and make wonderful breeders and parents. They thrive with a mate or a few other birds in their home.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Finches do not talk or scream, but they do make some sounds. These sounds are often described as beeps, chatter, and warbles, but they also sing.</p><p>Society finches are often used in laboratory settings to study vocalizations due to the syntax or structure that their songs have. Females are not likely to sing like males do, though.</p><h2>Society Finch Colors and Markings </h2><p>Both male and female society finches can come in various combinations of white, brown, and tan shades. They have either two-toned or flesh-colored beaks.</p><p>Color mutations include the normal chocolate brown, pied, fawn, chestnut, red-brown, white, crested, albino, dilute, creme-ino, pearl, and grey.</p><h2>Caring for the Society Finch </h2><p>Society finches need socialization with other finches so you should never have just one, and plenty of space to fly around in a safe enclosure or aviary is also a must. Unlike some delicate birds, room temperatures are sufficient to house these tiny birds.</p><p>If a flight cage is used, small bar spaces must be present to avoid escape and a nest should be provided to allow your finches a place to sleep and cuddle -- even if you don't plan on them breeding.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Finches are especially prone to two types of parasites - air sac mites (which are life threatening since they reside in the respiratory tract, and scaly face mites that cause scales on the skin. Both types of mites require veterinary attention.</p><p>Aside from mite concerns, society finches are also prone to developing overgrown beaks and nails, and they may need regular trimming.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Society finches will thrive on a high quality pelleted diet designed for finches. While finches do eat seeds in the wild, they also eat various fruits, flowers, insects, and other items. Just offering a diet of seeds is not complete and balanced.</p><p>Fresh fruits, veggies, vitamins, spray millet, cooked egg, and other items will be needed to provide a more well-rounded diet if pellets are not fed.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Society finches need to be able to hop around from branch to branch and fly. This means a safe and secure aviary or flight cage should be provided to allow your bird room to spread its wings without being injured.</p><p>Quiet</p><p>Small</p><p>Easy to care for</p><p>Not good for handling</p><p>Doesn't talk</p><p>Short lived compared to other birds</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Society Finch </h2><p>Society finches are readily availble from pet stores that routinely sell birds and may also be found in bird rescues or from a breeder. They are inexpensive birds, typically costing less than $30.</p>",661
54,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cockatoos-as-pets-1238604,Birds > Pet Bird Species,<h1>Cockatoo: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Cockatoo: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>Cockatoos are lively, affectionate birds that become an owner's best friendthey're even capable of mimicking your words if you're around them long enough. There are 21 species of cockatoos in the world, with the most common species in captivity including the Moluccan, Goffin's, umbrella, sulfur-crested (greater and lesser), and bare-eyed cockatoos.</p><p>All cockatoos can be identified by a crest that can be lifted and lowered. The cockatoo bird family is primarily divided into two subfamilies: white cockatoos (species) and dark cockatoos (species). There are a few outlying species that do not fit into either category, like cockatiels, which are the smallest member of the cockatoo family.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black-and-redcockatoos, red-tailed blackcockatoos, white cockatoos, black-and-yellow cockatoos, yellow-tailed black cockatoos</p><p>Scientific Name: (white) (dark), (cockatiels), (galah) (gang-gang), (palm), (Major Mitchell's)</p><p>Adult Size: 12 to 24in inches (varies by species)</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 to 70 years depending on the species, or occasionally longer; cockatiels can live for about 20 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>All cockatoo species occur in Australia and the islands around Oceania, including Malaysia, thePhilippines,the easternIndonesianislands ofWallaceatoNew Guinea, and theSolomon Islands. Cockatoos occupy a wide range of habitats, from forests in subalpine regions to mangroves.The most widespread species, like the galah and cockatiel, prefer open-country land where there are plentiful grass seeds.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Cockatoos are lively, affectionate birds. They are quite cuddly and bond very closely with their owners. However, their sociability and need for affection mean they demand a great deal of time from their owners. Deprived of attention, cockatoos will become depressed, exhibit neurotic behaviors, or self-mutilate. They are intelligent, playful, mischievous, and can be exceptionally loud.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Cockatoos are excitable, and sometimes they do not mix well with young kids. A cockatoo's powerful beak can injure small, prodding hands, so take care when introducing a cockatoo to a household with small children.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Cockatoos aren't as prolific as some of the other parrots when it comes to talking, but they do have decent speech capabilities. Cockatoos can mimic almost any sound, including words. The size of your bird's vocabulary is entirely up to your efforts. A cockatoo's speaking ability depends on its species and how much training they receive. Galah, sulfur-crested,and long-billedcockatoos are the best talkers in the family.</p><p>Be aware that some cockatoos may scream the words they have learned. This tendency can be irritating and can cause problems with neighbors and visitors.</p><h2>Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>Theplumageof cockatoos is not as vibrant as that of other kinds of parrots. Cockatoos are generally black, gray, or white. Many species have smaller splotches of yellow, pink, and red on their crest or tail. The galah and Major Mitchell's cockatoo have pink tones.</p><p>Several species have a vividly-colored ring around bare eyes. For example, the palm cockatoo has a large, red patch of bare skin that rings the eye and covers some of the face. Other species with rings around the eyes include the bare-eyed (little corella) and blue-eyed cockatoo.</p><p>The plumage of males and females is similar in most species. There are a few species with sexual dimorphism, or visual differences between the sexes, namely the gang-gang, red-tailed, and glossy-black cockatoos. Female and male cockatiels have the same patterns on their feathers when young, but female plumage will continue to have barring or stippling on her tail and wing feather while males will have solid colored feathers after a year of age. Some species vary by eye color only (not scientifically proven); female galahs, Major Mitchell's, and white cockatoos have red tones in their eyes, while males all have dark brown irises.</p><h2>Caring for the Cockatoo </h2><p>Cockatoos need a strong cage made of wrought iron or stainless steel, which is necessary to withstand the cockatoo's tough beak. Horizontal bar wires will allow the cockatoo to exercise by climbing on the sides of the cage.</p><p>Smaller cockatoos should have a cage no smaller than 24 by 36 by 48 inches with a bar spacing of 3/4 inch to 1 inch. Cockatoos including the Goffin's cockatoo, galah cockatoo, and the lesser sulfur-crested cockatoo should live happily in a cage of this size.</p><p>Larger cockatoos, including the umbrella, Moluccan, and palm species, need a sizable cage that is at least 24 by 48 by 48 inches with a bar spacing of 1 inch to 1 1/2 inches. The larger the cage, the better.</p><p>Cockatoos are diurnal birds that need at least 12 to 14 hours of uninterrupted sleep at night. In the wild, they usually get active midmorning once the day warms up. In captivity, cockatoos rise with the sun and will let you know it's time to wake up.</p><p>Cockatoos produce feather dust from their special powder-down feathers. This fine powder is used in preening. It's similar to a fine dust and it spreads throughout the homes of cockatoo owners and can affect those with animal allergies. To keep the dust level in check, bathe your bird once a week and invest in an air filter.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Cockatoos are prone to neurotic behavior, including feather picking and self-mutilation, if they lack the affection and attention they need. Additionally, if cuddled or stimulated inappropriately (sexually), they develop problems with their reproductive system like cloacal prolapse and becoming egg bound.</p><p>Other common diseases that can affect cockatoos include psittacine beak and feather disease, a viral disease that attacks the immune system; bumblefoot, painful lesions on the bird's feet; and obesity, which results from a high-fat diet and insufficient physical activity.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, a cockatoo's diet consists primarily of nuts and seeds. In captivity, cockatoos need a variety of fresh foods along with a good quality avian pellet-based diet. Pellets can make up 75 percent of the menu, while fresh vegetables, fruits, and grains should make up the rest (25%). Seeds and seed mixes should only be used as a limited treat item since they are high in fat. Nuts are another healthy special treat on occasion.</p><p>Birds of varied species and different sizes have variable food needs.The best way to gauge how much you should feed your bird is to watch how much it is eating and discarding.Cockatoos tend to like to play with and toss their food and chew on everything.</p><p>Offer more at first and scale back based on how much food remains untouched. If the bird is maintaining a good weight for its size (vets recommend weighing weekly with a gram scale) and is in good general health, then you know you are on the right track. In terms of feeding times, in the wild, most birds forage for food in the morning and right before dusk. This feeding schedule works for most pet birds.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Cockatoos love to chew and destroy things, so providing chewable toys is a necessity. Offer softwood toys, tree branches, vegetable-tanned leather, rope toys (supervise use), bells, and cardboard. Cockatoos like hanging toys and toys that can be picked up by the feet. Toys with hanging strands simulate preening and are popular with cockatoos.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>All toys must be bird-safe and carefully secured so that they do not become a strangulation hazard.</p><p>Give yourcockatoothree to four hours of playtime outside the cage and at least 3-5 hours of interaction with you each day. The larger the bird, the more interaction it needs with a human or other birds. Large bird play gyms with a perch outside of the enclosure are a suitable place for your birds to meet their daily exercise requirements.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Can be taught to mimic human speech</p><p>Long-lived bird</p><p>Screams when bored, irritated, or excited</p><p>Requires three to five hours of exercise and interaction</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cockatoo </h2><p>Cockatoos are common in the United States and can be rescued, adopted, or purchased at verified organizations like Rescue the Birds or adoption websites like Petfinder. Pricing ranges from $500 to $4,000, varying greatly depending on the species. Scarce species like the black palm cockatoo can cost up to $25,000 from breeders.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable by asking them how long they've been breeding and working with the species you're interested in. Take a tour of the facility and make sure the cages are clean, the birds are fed a varied diet, and the breeder is knowledgeable and receptive to your questions.</p><p>Look for signs of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and good appetite. It should appear alert and active.</p>",1386

These birds pack a lot of personality into a smaller, easier-to-care-for package. They are also among the best talkers and enjoy socializing with their human flock.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Severe macaw, chestnut-fronted macaw, Brazilian green macaw</p><p>Adult Size: 15 to 20 inches, weighing just under 1 pound</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can be expected to live for up to 30 years, some even longer</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The severe macaw is native to southern Central America and northern South America. It's particularly well-known in Panama and Bolivia. There are also populations in Brazil, where the bird is commonly known as the Brazilian green macaw. This species has been introduced to Florida as well. It gets the name ""severe"" for its aggressive stage of development at adolescence.</p><p>In the wild, the severe macaw enjoys forests and habitats of all kinds as long as trees are available. They generally prefer areas that are subject to river flooding. It can be challenging to see them because they enjoy roosting in cavities high up in the trees.</p><p>Farm fields offer plenty of food for these birds. It's not uncommon to find large, very loud flocks foraging the fields early in the morning. These birds can be a nuisance for farmers.</p><p>Severe macaws often congregate at clay licks with a variety of other birds. These clay hills usually caused by erosion along riverbanks are popular spots for many parrots. It's thought that the clay supplements their diet, protecting against toxins in their food and providing essential minerals.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Not bred in captivity as long as other parrots, severe macaws have not been fully domesticated. They continue to exhibit many of their instincts like lunging and screeching. However, when socialized as a young bird, they can become ideal pets.</p><p>Friendly and comical, the severe macaw's larger-than-life personality makes it a favorite among bird lovers. With adequate socialization, severe macaws bond quickly with their owners, responding well to training, learning tricks, and boasting impressive speech abilities.</p><p>Severe macaws are also curious. They love puzzles and games and can become enamored by shiny things. Keep your jewelry out of reach; it may get unintentionally damaged.</p><p>One unique characteristic that seems out of place with this friendly species is that they generally don't like a lot of touching. Quite often, they're more content to be near their owner or on their shoulder, but in most cases, this parrot does not like cuddling or petting.</p><p>Like many parrots, severe macaws go through a bluffing stage as they reach maturity. This stage can last for two weeks or up to two years. If you plan on getting a young macaw, you will need to be patient and enforce its training during potential periods of lunging, nipping, biting, hissing, and general resistance to interaction. For this reason, pre-adolescent macaws may not be suitable for families with young children.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Severe macaws are one of the best talking parrots. Many of these birds can speak with surprising clarity, and their high-pitched voice is quite fun to listen to. They can also develop an extensive vocabulary.</p><p>Their vocalizations can be fun and fabulous to display for guests, but this bird can become too much for some owners and their neighbors. It is a very loud bird for its size, and is known to call out in the morning, midday, and sunset. It is best to ignore unwanted screams rather than scold the bird. They're smart birds, and they will eventually learn right from wrong.</p><h2>Severe Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Severe macaws are mostly a shimmery green with dark, chestnut-colored patches on their foreheads and under their beaks. The crown of their head has a patch of iridescent blue feathers, and they bear distinctive red patches on the edges of their wings. The tail feathers are blue with red undersides, which shimmer when they're in flight.</p><p>This species exhibits the classic bare macaw facial patch. This bird also has fine, dark feather lines circling the eyes, which is unique among macaws.</p><p>The bird's beak and feet are gray, and the iris of their eyes is a beautiful yellow-gold. It's a monomorphic bird, meaning that the males and females are identical. To determine the sex, your bird would require genetic testing or a surgical sexing procedure.</p><h2>Caring for a Severe Macaw </h2><p>While severe macaws are known to be very social, all parrots require a certain amount of training to ensure that the bird remains tame. Make sure that you at least two hours to spend with your pet each day.</p><p>Without socialization and adequate mental stimulation, severe macaws can grow bored and depressed, which can leadto destructive behavior and stress-related illness.</p><p>Severe macaws can be fun pets, but they require time and specialized care that not everyone can provide. They thrive on family time because it replicates the feeling of a flock, and, unlike some other parrots, they don't tend to become strictly one-person birds.</p><p>Another consideration before you commit to this bird is the cost of ownership. In addition to the initial layout for the bird, think about the avian veterinarian bills, high-quality feed, and the accessory costs for a cage, play stand, and toys.</p><p>Even for a smaller macaw, this bird needs a cage sized for a large macaw that is at least 5-feet tall and 3-feet wide and 2-feet long. These birds need room to stretch out their wings fully and ample space to move about the cage without hindrance.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Severe macaws are a hardy species of macaw. They do not get ill frequently. However, if they were to be exposed to other ill birds, they are susceptible to proventricular dilation disease (macaw wasting disease) and psittacosis (chlamydiosis or parrot fever).</p><p>The key to a healthy bird is a well-balanced diet, a regular exercise regimen, sanitary housing conditions, uninterrupted sleep at night, and daily socialization with its human flock.</p><p>If the bird feels neglected or ignored, it may resort to unwanted behaviors like feather plucking or loud screeching.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, their diet consists of seeds, nuts, fruits, green leafy matter, and flowers. Feed your severe macaw a varied diet consisting of high-quality seed and pellet mix and daily offerings of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables.</p><p>Each macaw, depending on its size, will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables every day. You can feed it once in the morning upon waking and at dusk before it goes to sleep.</p><p>Fruits that are good to feed to macaws include apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangos, papayas, and berries. Healthy vegetables include carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, and leafy greens. Never feed avocado, chocolate, or rhubarb; these foods are toxic to birds. As a treat, offer nuts like macadamias, walnuts, pecans, almonds, and hazelnuts.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Severe macaws might be smaller macaws,but they are all muscle. In the wild, a severe macaw might fly several hundred miles a day looking for food. It is essential to provide sufficient exercise for your pet to maintain a healthy body.</p><p>Pet severe macaws should be given a minimum of two to four hours playtime outside of their cage each day. This out-of-cage time will enable the bird to stretch its muscles and exercise its wings and beak.</p><p>You should also provide your bird with many toys. They are intelligent birds and will thoroughly enjoy any puzzles or games you can give them. To keep your bird stimulated, rotate its toys often, so it always feels like it has a new toy.</p><p>Intelligent, can learn to speak and perform tricks</p><p>Smaller-sized macaw</p><p>Less prone to avian diseases</p><p>Can be noisy, not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Requires at least 2 to 4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time</p><p>More wild than other macaw species</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Severe Macaw </h2><p>Purchase a severe macaw from a reputable breeder or adoption agency. Contact breedersto see if you can spend some time with them and their birds. Talk to someone who has experience raising thesebirds before you decide if they are right for you. Also, be aware that these birds can cost about $1,500 to $2,500.</p><p>Make sure that the bird you want to take home is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1407
56,https://www.thesprucepets.com/blue-fronted-amazon-parrots-390252,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Large Bird Breeds,<h1>Blue-Fronted Amazon Parrot: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Blue-Fronted Amazon Parrot: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>Blue-fronted Amazon parrots are among the best-talking birds kept as pets. They have brilliant colorings, and each bird has distinct feather patternsto go along with its extroverted personality. Known as comedians and feathered show-offs, they are an entertaining bird. They really enjoy spending time with their human flock, which is why they make excellent pets. This bird is a larger parrot, so you will need to provide it with lots of room and your dedicated time.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Blue-fronted Amazon parrot, turquoise-fronted Amazon parrot</p><p>Adult Size: 15 and 17 inches long, weighing between 14 and 15 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: Can live to 80 or 100 years; most commonly will live 40 or so years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Swedish botanist Carl Linnaeus was the first to record the blue-fronted Amazon parrot in zoological records in 1758. The species has a broad habitat range. Wild populations can be found in Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, and northern Argentina, extending south to Buenos Aires.</p><p>At least one feral population is known to be near Stuttgart, Germany. This flock is likely the result of pet parrots escaping and forming a group that grew over time.</p><p>The blue-fronted Amazon typically inhabits woodlands and forests. They live in large flocks and tend to form a strong bond with their mate. Like most parrots, they nest in tree cavities where the female performs the incubation duties and caring for the young.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Active and comical, blue-fronted Amazons are natural performers. They love to be around their owners and will ham it up for extra attention. When well-socialized, these parrots will enjoy the company of the entire family, though they tend to choose a favorite.</p><p>While generally non-aggressive and friendly with other birds, some individuals will try to protect their keepers when they perceive danger. This species may ""dive-bomb"" a perceived threat by swooping down on it. During breeding or molting periods, males may become territorial.</p><p>Overall, owners tend to describe this species as very social, independent, and easy-going. This bird tends to be calmer than other Amazons and can keep themselves occupied for quite some time. That doesn't mean it requires less attention. The blue-fronted Amazon wants to be part of the action; it will loudly let you know when it feels left out. Prolific talkers and singers, they vocalize often and can be very loud when they want to be.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>While blue-fronted Amazons are excellent talkers, they are even better screamers. You can expect a morning wake up call and one again at sunset. This 10-minute, twice-daily call is a carryover from their instinct to mark the time of day for their flockmates. For people who live in close quarters like apartment buildings, these birds can be a little too loud and annoy neighbors.</p><h2>Blue-Fronted Amazon Colors and Markings </h2><p>The primary color of this parrot is beautiful lime green. Their ""blue-fronted"" description comes from ablotch of blue or turquoisefound just above the beak. Though this is the species' trademark, breeding has created a wide range of markings on the birds' heads. These markings make it easier to distinguish an individual parrot from the flock.</p><p>Some birds have no blue on the head while others have a head that is almost entirely turquoise. Yellow typically surrounds the blue and stretches over and under the head before giving way to the body's bright green feathers. You might even find birds with white patches.</p><p>Generally, the blue-fronted has touches of bright red on the shoulders andflight feathers, which may also have a violet tint when in flight. This also varies by individual, and some have only green shoulders, particularly wild parrots found in northwestern Argentina.</p><p>In captivity, there are a few color mutations such as cinnamon blue-fronted Amazons, which have brownish-yellow body feathers rather than green. The lutino variation typically has white feathers where you would generally expect yellow. There is also a blue mutation that has produced an entirely blue bird with patches of yellow.</p><p>Typically, thebeaks are black, and the feet are grey. It's a monomorphic species, so the males and females look alike. The only way to know the sex of your bird is through DNA or surgical sexing.</p><h2>Caring for a Blue-Fronted Amazon </h2><p>These birds are highly intelligent and social, and they need regular human interaction. Don't adopt an Amazon parrot if you don't have plenty of time to spend with it.</p><p>The more activities around the house you can include your parrot in, the happier it will be. Whether you're watching TV, cleaning up, or eating dinner, the blue-fronted will want to be part of the action. A portable play stand that you can move from room to room makes a good exercise area. Your bird will amuse you with his acrobatic antics.</p><p>The minimum recommendedcage sizefor an active bird like a blue-fronted Amazon is a 3-foot cube, though larger is better. If you can't get a sizeable cage, try to compensate by allowing it extra out-of-cage time each day.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Some bacterial infections can cause respiratory problems for Amazons, as well as a fatal fungal disease (aspergillosis) and nutritional deficiencies.</p><p>The main bacteria that are problematic for Amazons include E. coli, Citrobacter, Staph, and Strep.The bacteria can spread through water, seeds, old food, humid areas, wet cages, or dusty spots.</p><p>Blue-fronted Amazons are prone to obesity and hypothyroidism. An active lifestyle with a regular exercise regimen can help reduce the risk of getting those conditions.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, blue-fronted Amazons forage on fruits and berries, leaf buds, and blossoms, as well as seeds and nuts. It's also believed that they eat some proteins. Like all parrots, blue-fronted Amazons need a varied dietthat mimics their natural foods.</p><p>A healthy diet shouldconsist of high-quality pellets, a quality seed mix, and daily servings of fresh, bird-safe fruits and vegetables.</p><h3>Warning</h3><p>Do not feed your Amazon avocados and chocolate as they are toxic to birds</p><p>Specially formulated pellets are an ideal food and should ideally represent approximately 75 to 80 percent of the bird's diet. Fruits, vegetables, and greens should account for about 20 to 25 percent of the daily diet. Seeds and nuts are high-fat foods that you can offer as occasional treats. Start by giving your bird 1 cup of pellet-based parrot mix and a 1/2 cup of fruits and vegetables daily, then adjust according to their appetite.</p><p>Essentially, many people foods that are considered healthy are okay to feed these parrots in moderation, including chicken.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>All Amazons are active parrotsand the blue-fronted should be allowed a minimum of 3 to 4 hours per day outside the cage. This activity allows it to play and stretch his wings and to be part of the family.</p><p>These birds love to climb and chew, so Amazon parrot owners should provide their pets with plenty of toys, including ladders and ropes to swing on. Keep a few extra chew toys ready to replace any that become too worn. Do not let your bird run out of playthings to entertain itself, especially if you are not around.</p><p>Bath time is a special joy of the blue-fronted Amazon. Provide a water bowl for splashing around to its heart's content. Some birds like to be spritzed with water while others may beg for a bath in the sink.

Also known as the Mexican red-headed parrot, they are intelligent, affectionate, and playful, and some learn to become excellent talkers. These birds have a mild temperament compared to other Amazons. More than anything, they want to be near you or their human flock.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Green-cheeked Amazon, red-crowned Amazon, Mexican red-headed parrot, red-headed Amazon</p><p>Adult Size: 11 to 13 inches with a wingspan of 15 to 16 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 50 years with proper care, and sometimes as long as 70 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Northeastern Mexico is the green-cheeked Amazon's natural habitat. The birds primarily live in the woodlands and lowland forests of the area. Social animals, their flocks can grow to more than 100 birds. You can often hear a flock is nearby before you can see it; it makes loud calls while in flight.</p><p>In the wild, the green-cheeked is an endangered species with only 3,000 and 6,000 left. Its population decline is due primarily to illegal trapping for the pet trade as well as habitat destruction. This species also lives in urban areas of southern California, and feral flocks exist in Florida, Texas, and Puerto Rico.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Playful and sweet, hand-fed green-cheeked Amazon parrots are good family pets that enjoy interacting with everyone. They are mild-mannered and appear content when they spend time with their handlers. They may join you while watching television or at the dinner table and are fans of handling and petting.</p><p>Curious and nosy, they are prone to mischief-making more than some other Amazon species. They may chew electrical wires around the house. Supervision and positive distractions are required when out of the cage.</p><p>While green-cheeked Amazons are known as comical, good-natured birds, some may go through a hormonal bluffing stage as they go through adolescence. This period can last for up to two years; the birds may become a little temperamental during this time. Be patient; it will pass.</p><p>Green-cheeked Amazons are not as independent or feisty as other Amazons, but they will have their moments of wanting to be left alone. Signs to watch for include the bird's feathers fanning out and ""blazing eye"" constricting pupils.</p><p>Highly intelligent, they can quickly learn entertaining bird tricks, as well as words and phrases. They are also very noisy.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Expect a loud 10-minute announcement every morning and evening. It's in the bird's nature to call out to its flock at those times. Many green-cheeked Amazons can become good talkers with consistent training. They are excellent mimics. Just be careful, as some individuals can get sassy, and owners have reported a little backtalk at times.</p><h2>Green-Cheeked Amazon Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Green-cheeked Amazons are primarily dark green with a bright red blaze that extends over their beak and forehead. There is a patch of brilliant blue behind their eyes that trails down the neck in some individuals. The undersides of the tail feathers are lime green or yellow. They have horn-colored beaks and flesh-colored legs.</p><p>It is nearly impossible to distinguish males from females. If you can get two side-by-side, you might notice that a male is slightly larger and that the red and blue patches on its face are more significant. That said, the only way to be sure of the sex of the birds is through DNA or surgical sexing.</p><h2>Caring for a Green-Cheeked Amazon Parrot </h2><p>Social interaction is necessary for any Amazon parrot; the green-cheeked is no different. Birds that don't receive enough handling and affection can develop destructive behaviors and becomedepressed. Emotional distress can lead to self-mutilation in the form of feather plucking and skin picking.</p><p>Unlike other pets, parrots need one-on-one interaction for a few hours every day. This activity keeps the bird happy and healthy in captivity, and it establishes a strong, rewarding bond for the owner and bird.</p><p>As a medium-sized parrot, the green-cheeked Amazon requires a substantial cage. They love to climb and should have room to stretch their wings while inside. The minimum size is 2 feet by 3 feet and up to 3 or 5 feet tall; the more space you can provide, the better.</p><p>Inside the cage, place the bird's perches at various heights and provide ladders and a variety of toys. At least once a week, your bird will appreciate a bath to help keep its feathers from drying out. A birdbath gives your bird an extra place to play. A handheld mister or spray bottle counts as enjoyable interaction time with your feathered friend.</p><p>A parrot is an expensive pet. It is not only the initial cost of the bird, but also factor in cage cost, toys, food, and annual visits to the avian veterinarian. The costs can add up quickly.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Most parrots that are stressed will feather-pluck out of boredom or lack of interaction. Inadequate diet, toxic exposures, and infections can also cause feather plucking.</p><p>In general, Amazons are prone to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections like psittacosis and aspergillosis. Also, this species will become overweight and can develop fatty liver disease if it does not get sufficient exercise or if it does not have a well-balanced diet.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>A green-cheeked Amazon's diet in the wild consists mainly of seeds, fruits, berries, flowers, and nectar. As pets, green-cheeked Amazons should have a high-quality pelleted food supplemented with a seed mix and daily servings of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Pelleted food is specially formulated to contain most of the bird's daily nutritional requirements; make it 75 percent of your bird's daily food intake. Provide at least 1/4 to 1/2 cup of pellet food per day. You can give more or less depending on your bird's appetite.</p><p>Chopped fruit and vegetables provide a stimulating, diverse mix of nutrients. This ""chop"" should comprise at least 20 percent of the bird's diet. These birds are known to be wasteful with fresh foods, which is a habit they have inherited from living in the wild. They will pick a fruit, take a few bites, then drop it to the ground. This bad habit can create a big mess in the cage. Food should not be left to linger in your bird's enclosure. Any fresh foods that you place in your Amazon's cage should be taken away after an hour or two.</p><p>On occasion or rotated every other day, you can provide a seed mix or treat the bird to a few nuts. Most Amazons love seeds and nuts, but this is a high-fat food to give sparingly.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Since Amazon parrots are prone to obesity, you must make sure your bird gets 3 to 4 hours of daily exercise. This enables the bird to burn excess calories and stretch its muscles. It also provides essential mental stimulation.</p><p>These birds are exceptionally playful, so they will thrive on a schedule of activities. Training is a fun way to interact with them.</p><p>Out of the cage, a play stand will let your bird enjoy the family's activities from a safe perch. This perch can also thwart naughty behavior, especially if it has toys that are more interesting than the things around your house.</p><p>Green-cheeked Amazons love to chew as much as they enjoy climbing. Place toys at different heights in the cage and at the play stand. When you provide an interesting play gym atmosphere, the bird can entertain itself. Rotate toys regularly and replace any that become too worn. Having a ready supply of wood, leather, rope, bells, and other bird-safe toys reduces the risk of boredom.</p><p>Intelligent, can talk and learn tricks</p><p>Affectionate, likes petting and holding</p><p>Long-lived species</p><p>Requires at least 3 to 4 hours of daily exercise, socialization</p><p>Can be noisy</p><p>Requires a large cage</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Green-Cheeked Amazon Parrot </h2><p>To ensure that a green-cheeked Amazon is the right bird for your family, visit alocalbreeder. Observe and interact with the birds to learn more about their personality before making a final decision.</p><p>When choosing a bird, it is best to select a hand-fed baby or at least a young bird accustomed to hand training. Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. Avoid a bird that is sitting quietly with puffed feathers; it might be ill. A well-handled young green-cheeked Amazon parrot can cost $250 to $2,000, depending on adoption fees or breeder price.</p>",1378

Their range generally extends from Mexico to Argentina. Unlike other parrots, military macaws tend to prefer arid lands over tropical rainforests. You can also find them in dry forests and in trees near the water. However, some of the South American flocks live in humid, lowland forests as well as canyons and foothills.</p><p>There are two subspecies of this macaw: the Mexican military macaw and the Bolivian military macaw. The Mexican military macaw is the largest; it primarily inhabits Mexico. The Bolivian military macaw has a range that extends from Bolivia to northern Argentina.</p><p>This bird is a protected species; it is considered vulnerable for extinction. Though the overall population exceeds 10,000, habitat loss and trapping for the pet trade have made some regional populations endangered.</p><p>Historically, the military macaw has been on record since the 1500s when Europeans first came to the new world. Its name derives from the military personnel who brought them back to Europe. It also alludes to their olive green coloring that resembles ""military green.""</p><p>This macaw is a popular species used for breeding hybrid macaws in captivity, such as calico macaws, milicinth macaws, and miligold macaws.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>The military macaw is an easily tamed, good-natured bird. In the wild, they are rarely alone, living in pairs or flocks of 10 to 20 birds. In captivity, It is not unusual for this bird to prefer one person or even one gender.

This alarming call happens again in the evening when readying for bedtime. While they're generally considered one of the quieter macaws, they can screech and have a distinct croak. This noise level is usually not suitable for apartment or condominium living.</p><h2>Military Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Military macaws are mainly green with more bright lime green on the head that progresses into darker and olive greens on the body. They havebrilliant blue edging on their wings and a bright red tuft on their foreheads. Their tail feathers include browns and reds with a yellow-olive tint underneath.</p><p>These birds have bold black beaks and dark gray legs and feet. Their eyes are framed by the classic bare macaw facial patches, each with concentric rings of small black feathers.</p><p>This is a monomorphic species, meaning males and females look alike. DNA or surgical sexing are the only ways to determine whether the bird is male or female.</p><h2>Caring for a Military Macaw </h2><p>In captivity, a parrot's owner becomes the bird's flockmate. This bird is not a pet that you can buy and ignore; these birds need interaction and mental stimulation. If you don't oblige them, you will pay the price in wrecked property, bitten fingers, and frustration.</p><p>The cage itself needs to be largeat least 2.5-feet by 3-feet wide and 5-feet tall. If you can, create a dedicated bird-safe room. Be sure to include a large perch inside the cage and have a play stand for time outside its home. The military macaw may become territorial with its cage; limit putting your hands in the cage while the bird is inside it.</p><p>You will need to clean the bird's cage on a regular schedule. Clean the perches and toys once a week, wash the floor of the cage once a month, and thoroughly sanitize the rest of the cage once a year.</p><p>Consider the costs of owning one of these parrots before rushing out to get one.

The exceptions are avocado, chocolate, and rhubarb, which are toxic to birds.</p><p>Depending on its size, a macaw will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables every day. You can feed it once in the morning upon waking and at dusk before it goes to sleep. Remove all uneaten food before bedtime.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>In the wild, military macaws fly several hundred miles a day. In captivity, regular exercise is essential.

They have also been introduced in Puerto Rico.</p><p>Blue and golds typically live in the forests near rivers and swamps, though they can be found in a grassy savannah if it has tall trees. Most often traveling in pairs, macaws will gather in large flocks at certain times of the year or will meet up during the morning and evening hours to forage for food.</p><p>Wild blue and golds are an endangered species. Much of their population decline in the wild has been due to habitat destruction, hunting, and trapping. Sadly, before captive breeding programs, these young birds were quite often taken directly from the nest and sold for the pet trade. Many defensive parents died protecting their babies, and many young parrots did not survive.</p><p>Since 1935, the blue and golds have been bred successfully in the U.S. Breeders are readily available, and their prevalence makes them one of the more affordable large parrots.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Their sociability and even, sweet disposition makes blue and gold macaws a great pet. Their intelligence, willingness to learn, and talking ability are a plus.</p><p>When allowed to socialize with a variety of people, blue and golds do very well adapting to different people and other birds. The blue and gold is a fantastic bird for tricks. They're a popular headliner at bird shows, and many owners may even take them out around town with the help of bird leashes and car seats.</p><p>Around the house, these macaws may act like friendly dogs. They enjoy being near their owners and seek out attention. They are also content on their perch, watching the activity around them.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Blue and gold macaws are capable of ear-shattering calls, which are usually not appreciated by close neighbors. They are not the best choice for those who live in apartments and condominiums or if you have small children who are startled by noise.</p><p>This bird is a great talker; it can learn quickly and aims to please. Training is relatively simple as long as you are consistent. They can learn a vocabulary of around 20 words and phrases. Given the clarity of their voice, many people consider them one of the best talking parrots.</p><h2>Blue and Gold Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Blue and gold macaws get their common name from their two most prominent feather colors. They typically have a green forehead, fading into a teal blue that covers the nape, back, tail, and wings. The chest and underside of the wings and belly are a bright golden yellow.</p><p>These birds have large black beaks and a black patch of feathers just underneath its beak. White patches of skin adorned with rings of tiny black feathers surround their eyes and cover much of the face.</p><p>Blue and gold macaws are monotypic, meaning there is only one bird that falls into the species. However, bird experts suggest that there are two variations or subspecies. These are the Bolivian blue and gold macaw, a larger bird with more of an actual blue coloring than the typical turquoise, and the blue-throated macaw, which has a teal blue throat instead of a black throat.</p><p>This bird is a monomorphic species, meaning males and females are barely distinguishable from each other. Many believed that the male has a flatter head, and the female has a narrower beak; the only way to prove the sex of this macaw is through surgical or genetic sexing.</p><h2>Caring for a Blue and Gold Macaw </h2><p>Like most macaws, the blue and gold thrives on attention fromitsowner and will form a strong bond with its family members. Take time to socialize these birds properly and to provide them with adequatementalstimulation; otherwise, theymight resort to screaming out of boredom.</p><p>These raucous birds require a cage that is at a minimum at least 5-feet tall and at least 3- or 4-feet wide and long. The bird needs lots of room to stretch its wings, hop and climb around, and keep itself occupied.</p><p>Some owners even have a dedicated, bird-safe room. Since these birds gnaw on almost anything, remove electrical wires, jewelry, and wooden furniture.</p><p>Another consideration before you commit to getting this bird is the cost of ownership. In addition to the cost of the bird, think about the avian veterinarian bills, high-quality feed, and the accessory costs for a cage, play stand, and toys.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Macaws may be long-lived birds, but, like all parrots, they are prone toa viral infection called macawwasting syndrome and overgrown beaks.</p><p>Like otherparrots,blueand golds may resort to self-mutilation by feather plucking if they feel neglected or bored.</p><p>A well-balanced diet and adequate exercise are necessary to maintain pet bird health.

The bird should also get a high-quality pelleted diet with some healthy seeds, such as flax, hemp, and chia. Avoid many nut treats; these are high in fat.</p><p>Each macaw, depending on its size, will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables every day. You can feed it once in the morning upon waking and at dusk before it goes to sleep. Remove all uneaten food before bedtime.</p><p>Fruits that are good to feed to macaws include apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangos, papayas, and berries. Healthy vegetables include carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, and leafy greens. Never feed avocado, chocolate, or rhubarb; these foods are toxic to birds.

This species is not naturally affectionate. However, with extensive training, hand-fed black palm cockatoos can make excellent, tame pets. This species thrives when it is socialized. Like other cockatoos, it craves regular interaction with its owners. This bird's large size, beak strength, and uneven temperament make it most suitable for experienced bird owners. These bold parrots require a fearless owner to match.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black palm cockatoo, palm cockatoo, goliath cockatoo, great black cockatoo, Van Oort's palm cockatoo, black macaw</p><p>Adult Size: 22 and 24 inches, weighing between 2 and 3 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: Between 40 and 60 years in the wild; up to 80 to 90 years in captivity with proper care</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The black palm cockatoo isnative to Australia, particularly the very tip of northernQueensland. Also, this species now lives in New Guinea and Indonesia. These birds generally inhabit the rainforest and woodlands and nest in hollow trees. It is common to find them in small groups of six or fewer birds. A pair will mate for life. Though their population is declining due to habitat loss as well as sport and trade hunting, they are not considered endangered or even vulnerable.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>The black palm cockatoo can be a good pet, but don't expect it to be as affectionate as many other parrots. To tame this species, the bird requires a lot of attention and consistent training. It is a brilliant and social bird, so if you are persistent, you can get this bird to follow your commands. You can teach this species to perform many simple tricks with time and positive reinforcement.</p><p>This is one of the very few bird species that will use tools. In their natural habitat, male birds will use a large stick to ""drum"" against a hollow tree before choosing where to build a nest. This drumming can be heard for up to 100 yards. When the stick breaks, it becomes part of the new nest. This behavior puzzles many scientists who study birds. Some scientists believe the females listen to the drumming, thendecideif it's a suitable nesting spot. Other scientists believe it is the sign of a male marking its territory.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>This bird's natural vocalizations have a human-like sound, including their signature ""hello."" Their vocal ability is well suited for learning words. They are one of the best talking cockatoos.</p><p>Ablack palm cockatoois not a good option for bird owners who live in apartments or condominiums. It makes very distinct, deafening calls, and you (and your neighbors) need to be able to tolerate loud noises to live with one.</p><h2>Black Palm Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>The black palm cockatoo is a very dark, smoky gray color that appears blacker on some birds than others. The same color appears on their very long crest, as well as their feet and legs.</p><p>This otherwise single-colored bird hasbright red patches of bare skin on their cheeks, which change colors when the bird gets excited. Their cheeks are as striking as its dark grayish-black beak, giving it a very distinct profile up close.</p><p>The size of its beak makes it look intimidating. Within the parrot family, their beak is only eclipsedin size by the hyacinth macaw. The size and shape of the beak, and the fact that the upper and lower mandibles don't meet, makes it perfect for cracking open nuts. Their strong beaks can cause injury. This species is not recommended for families with children.</p><p>This bird is a monomorphic species, meaning there is no visual way to tell males from females. If you want to determine sex, genetic or surgical sexing is necessary.</p><h2>Caring for Black Palm Cockatoos </h2><p>Though there is some appeal to these birds in the exotic pet trade, they are not as common as other cockatoos. Generally, they are seen most often in zoos, professional aviaries, and bird shows. This exclusivity is mostly due to their temperament and extensive care and training requirements.</p><p>Black palm cockatoos should not be left alone for more than eight hours a day. This species is not the right choice if you maintain regular obligations outside of the home for long periods.</p><p>The black palm cockatoo requires a large enough cage to accommodate flight and play. The cage should be at least 10 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 6 feet high. If you cannot accommodate a cage this size or an aviary, it is best to consider one of the smallercockatoo species.</p><p>These powder-down parrots enjoy baths and should regularly get the opportunity to get wet. The natural dust shed by this bird can coat the nearby surfaces and trigger allergies for those sensitive to dust or animal dander.</p><p>This bird's long lifespan serves the breed well because it usually lays one egg every two years or so. Among the parrots, it has one of the lowest reproduction rates.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Though it is a large bird, it is light for its size and prone to obesity in captivity. Other common ailments that can affect these birds include kidney problems, bacterial infections, and psittacine beakand feather disease (PBFD), a viral condition.</p><p>If the bird does not receive sufficient mental stimulation, it can develop behavioral issues such as feather plucking or excessive screaming.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, black palm cockatoos often feed in the early morning hours. Its native diet is palm fruit, nuts from the kanari tree (Java almond), stringy eucalyptus tree bark, and tree seeds. Their strong beak can open the toughest nuts.</p><p>Like all cockatoos, black palm cockatoos can easily become overweight, so owners should carefully supervise their fat intake. Half of its menu should consist of high-quality pellets, and the other half should be fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Occasionally feed nuts in the shell; this will exercise their beak. Keep nuts to a minimum, though, as most are high in fat.</p><p>Start by offering your bird 1/3 cup of pellets and 1/3 cup of fruits and vegetables daily. Increase the amount as needed. Never feed chocolate or avocado; these foods are toxic to birds.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Being large birds, they need lots of exercise to maintain their physical health. Make sure that your bird is allowed a minimum of three to four hours outside of its cage each day so it can stretch its muscles, play, and socialize with you.These birds require regularly scheduled time for training.</p><p>These birds are curious. Make sure you supervise them when outside of the cage to prevent accidents and unwanted chewing on your household goods, furniture, or walls. Be mindful of electric wires around the house; these are potentially hazardous if your bird chews on them.</p><p>Toys provide enrichment and will keep the bird occupied. Provide plenty of stimulation with wood toys, ropes, and other things the bird can chew on. Always have more toys readily available when they get destroyed. Rotate toys in and out as the bird loses interest. Playstands, perches, ladders, and swings can also help your bird burn off excess energy.</p><p>Beautiful, impressive-looking bird with unique drumming ability</p><p>One of the best speaking cockatoos</p><p>Can learn to do many tricks</p><p>Long-lived species</p><p>Can be noisy, not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Requires at least 3 to 4 hours of supervised out-of-cage time</p><p>Emits powdery down that can aggravate allergies</p><p>Requires a room-sized cage or aviary</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy the Black Palm Cockatoo </h2><p>Purchase a black palm cockatoo from a reputable breeder or adoption agency.

Also called the blue-winged macaw, it is a small parrot that requires plenty of attention. As an extremely social bird, it wants to be part of the family. Most people choose a mini macaw species because they think they can't handle a larger bird. However, looks can be deceiving. An Illiger's macaw looks mini but acts just like the big guys.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Illiger's macaw, Illiger's miniature macaw, blue-winged macaw</p><p>Adult Size: 15 to 17 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: About 60 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The range of the Illiger's macaw is toward the southern part of central South America, including the forests and woodlands of central and eastern Brazil, northern Argentina, and most of Paraguay. The birds thrive on palm trees. The tree is a food source for them and provides plenty of protection from predators and stormy weather.Social by nature, wild Illiger's reside in pairs or small flocks. They enjoy the company of other parrots species, including other macaws and conures.</p><p>The bird got its name from German zoologist Johann Karl WilhelmIlliger, who first described the birds to the scientific community.</p><p>Unfortunately, Illiger's populations in the wild are threatened and considered an endangered species due to habitat destruction. For many farmers, the birds are considered pests. Grains and farmers' crops have become a substitute for their disappearing natural food sources.</p><p>Hunting and trapping have done further damage to their numbers. Baby macaws intended for the pet trade are often snatched from nests. Many of these captured young parrots die or are stressed out before finding a new home. They often lack adequate care and attention. The U.S. bans the import of wild-caught birds that are endangered or threatened. This includes Illiger's macaws.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Illiger's macaws are playful, friendly birds that enjoy human interaction. When handfed as babies and raised in loving, attentive homes, these intelligent birds will bond strongly with their owners. The connection can be so strong that the bird will mimic its owner's emotions. If their owner is sad or happy, the bird will often follow suit. As an owner, if you maintain an even temperament, you will often find it reflected in your compassionate bird.</p><p>These birds require a lot of mental stimulation, and they like to stay busy. They want to be part of the action in a home and will often wander around looking for something that piques their interest or will sit on your shoulder to see what you're doing. Their curiosity and quick wit also help them respond quickly to positive training techniques.</p><p>While Illiger's macaws aren't known to be particularly loud, they are still macaws, and they do have some vocalizations.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>An Illiger's call is often compared to a crow, and you can expect greetings as well as attention-getting calls when they want to play. Some owners have found the noise to be too much. They are moderate talkers, and some individuals can learn several words. They have a clown-like personality and often surprise their owners with witty responses.</p><h2>Illiger's Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Illiger's macaws are mostly green with a bright red blaze on their foreheads. The feathers of the neck and the top of the head are a beautiful iridescent blue. They have brownish-red patches on their lower back, abdomen, and tail feathers, which are edged in a brilliant blue. In-flight, you'll see a yellow to olive green cast under their wings.</p><p>This species has orange eyes framed by the classic bare macaw facial patches. Their black beaks are large for their size, and they have flesh-colored feet and legs.</p><p>Illiger's macaws are considered monomorphic birds, meaning males and females look alike. Young macaws will not have the vivid colorings of adults, but in time, this will develop.</p><h2>Caring for the Illiger's Macaw </h2><p>If you are interested in owning an Illiger's macaw, make sure that you have a lot of time to spend with thisbird. If it feels neglected, it will become bored, angry, and destructive. A neglected or sad macaw is no fun to be around, and owners will quickly learn that these birds can and do hold grudges if they are mistreated. Illiger's macaws are powerful chewers. An angry macaw can damage doors, windowsills, and expensive molding. Give Illiger's macaws plenty ofsafe bird toysto keep them occupied andenriched with activity.</p><p>If possible, consider adopting two birds. They can keep each other company and busy, which can do wonders for the birds' well-being. Illiger's thrive in a captive pairing. They also do well in aviaries with other species, so a second Illiger's is not entirely necessary.</p><p>During its development, it will have a nippy phase. Proper training with positive reinforcement is key to making this phase pass as quickly as possible. You can ignore the nips, remove your hands, and distract the bird. Or when a bird bites, put the bird back in its cage or on its play stand to teach it that nipping does not get rewarded with time with you.</p><p>These birds also need to fly. They are acrobats in the air with graceful movements. Consider the largest cage you can afforda high-quality one that can last the bird's lifetime and is large enough to accommodate some flight.</p><p>Before getting an Illiger's macaw, consider the high cost of ownership. The veterinary bills,high-qualityfeed, toys, and cage expenses add up quickly. If you can't provide your bird with the best of everything, consider waiting until you can.</p><p>Also, think about spending some time with a bird that you are considering for your home. They can be temperamental. Try to detect if the bird has potential behavioral issues before bringing it home with you.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Illiger's can live around 50-60 years. Illiger's are susceptible to the same diseases as other macaws.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Illiger's macaws in the wild eat a diet that is higher in fat than other macaw species to meet their high-energy needs. Their favorite foods come from all parts of the palm, and their big beaks can crack open hard palm nuts. They also eat green vegetables, grains, seeds, nuts, and a great variety of fruits.</p><p>Feed your Illiger's a diet consisting of high-quality seed and pellet mix and a varied mixture of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables daily. Any fresh foods that you place in your Amazon's cage should be taken away when feeding time is over. You can expect that the bird will eat about 10 percent of its body weight per day.</p><p>Illiger's may become bored with the same foods every day. They can become picky eaters at times. Toxic parrot foods to avoid include avocado, chocolate, and coffee.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>In the wild, the Illiger's macaw is a bird on the move. Owners need to pay particular attention to exercise. Illiger's macaw should get plenty of time outside their cage for exercise daily. A play stand adorned with toys will help with training. Toys should be stimulating, varied, and rotated often. Wood is an excellent toy material for its large beak and offers an acceptable outlet for its chewing instinct. Leather, beads, and ropes will also be welcomed playthings for this comical macaw.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Compassionate, can read your emotions</p><p>Smaller-sized bird</p><p>May not be as noisy, but can still get loud and may not be well-suited for apartments</p><p>Requires plenty of daily exercise, socialization</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Illiger's Macaw </h2><p>It may be difficult to verify whether an imported Illiger's macaw is wild-caught or captive-bred since the Wild Bird Protection Act of 1992 banned the import of all Illiger's macaws to the U.S. Although they are hard to find, multiple breeding programs in the U.S. helped to proliferate the species from birds already in the U.S. before the import ban.</p><p>You may find Illiger's macaws online at a premium price.</p>",1294

Their beautiful colors, talking ability, and lovable personalities have established this bird as one of the most popular pet parrots. This bird is one of the larger parrot species, and it does require the right owner with plenty of time and space to house this bird.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Eclectus parrot,Solomon Island eclectus parrot,Grand eclectus parrot, yellow-sidedeclectus parrot, Vosmaeri eclectus parrot, blue-bellied eclectusparrot, red-sided eclectusparrot, dusky eclectusparrot</p><p>Adult Size: 17 and 20 inches, weighing 13 to 18 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 to 50 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Eclectus parrots live intropical rainforests and originated in the Solomon Islands. Wild populations also live in northeasternAustralia, Indonesian, the Moluccas, and New Guinea. Its name ""eclectus""is derived from the word ""eclectic"" since the male and female species look so different.</p><p>In their native monsoon forests, eclectusnest high up in the trees. They usually manage to find a deep nest hole in a tree where they can lay their eggs and raise a family.</p><p>There are several eclectus parrot subspecies. The Solomon Island eclectus is the most common one in the pet trade.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>The eclectus is a very friendly and intelligent bird species described as gentle, tranquil, and caring. Eclectus parrots are also affectionate. Most thrive best when socialization is part of their daily routine. They cherish the time they spend interacting with their families. They are also sensitive and can quickly become stressed if they feel neglected.</p><p>This bird will learn the routine and what to expect in your household. They enjoy the comings and goings, as well as being a part of it.</p><p>Around 18 months of age, the birds begin to reach sexual maturity. Sometimes this brings with it some aggression or the instinct to ""feed"" whatever is nearby. You may notice some naughty nipping behavior. This period is called bluffing, and it is best to ignore it and turn to distraction techniques instead of reinforcing it. With time, they pass through the phase and learn what's acceptable.</p><p>While both the males and females of the species make lovely pets, many owners claim that males tend to be a bit more trainable and agreeable. On the flip side, females may be less dependent on their owners and tend to handle stress better. Females may also be bossier and more aggressive than a male, particularly during breeding. Even in captivity, a female's nesting instincts remain strong. You might find her trying to nest in secluded areas of your home.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Eclectus parrots join Amazons and African greys as being one of the best species for training to speak. They are quick to learn almost anything you want to teach them. Many people find them to be on the quieter side when compared to other parrots. They have adistinctive honk and other vocalizationsthat can be amusing the first few times, but loud and startling.</p><h2>Eclectus Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>Eclectus are known as sexually dimorphic, meaning that you can tell the sex of the bird by its physical characteristics. Male eclectus birds are a brilliant emerald green color with bright orange beaks and splashes of red and blue under their wings. By contrast, the females are mostly bright red with black beaks and deep purple markings on their chests and tails. Before the early 20th century, since the male and female birds looked so different, they were thought to be entirely two different species.</p><p>Instead of distinct lines found on many bird's feathers, eclectus feathers seem to blend. Their coloring makes for brilliant camouflage in their native habitat; you can often hear them before you can see them.</p><h2>Caring for an Eclectus Parrot </h2><p>Most eclectus birds can live in a multiple bird household, but some have jealous tendencies. Make sure to give an eclectus your undivided time and attention when introducing it or any new bird or your aviary.</p><p>An eclectus lives best in an aviary11 feet long by 3 foot wide and 7 feet high especially if you keep a pair. These birds like to fly, climb, and stay busy. If you do not have room for an aviary, then make sure the cage you provide is at the minimum 2 feet long by 3 feet wide and 4 feet tall.</p><p>This species can be a good fit for households with children as it has a gentle nature. However, they don't like to be startled and prefer a calm environment. They are not big fans of constant loud noises like barking, crying, or screaming. Thus, it's essential to consider if your family dynamic is a good match for the bird.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>An eclectus is unique in that it sometimes exhibits toe-tapping and wing-flipping. This behavior is similar to feather plucking, which is a common issue with parrots that feel neglected. However, when all three of these actions occur in an eclectus, it can be a sign of a severe health issue. Nutritional deficiencies caused by excess vitamins and minerals (like vitamin A), fortified foods, or artificial ingredients as well as eating foreign objects like beads, or stress are probable causes. It's vital to see an avian vet right away.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, these birds prefer pomegranate, papaya, and figs, though they'll also eat flowers, buds on trees, and a few seeds. When kept as a pet, their diet must include fresh fruits, vegetables, and carbohydrates. Cooked pasta or grain bakea homemade casserole just for birdswill ensure they get all the necessary carbs.</p><p>The eclectus has a specialized digestive tract that is different from many other bird species. This bird needs to be fed a diet high in fiber and low in fat. It's also best to avoid too many vitamin and mineral supplements, which could lead to digestive tumors or abnormal behavior.</p><p>Avoid feeding parrot mixes that contain artificial dyes, flavorings, or preservatives. These additives could cause your pet to lose its beautiful color and may even be toxic for this sensitive species.</p><p>An eclectus' daily meal should be about 80 percent fruits and vegetablesthe rest can be parrot pellets. Give seeds and nuts as occasional treats. Feed this bird twice a day, once upon rising, and 1 to 2 hours before bedtime. Offer 1 cup of fruits and vegetables and 1/3 cup of parrot mix at each feeding.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>The eclectus are active birds and need plenty of room to exercise. They should have access to a large play stand and a bird-safe area for climbing and exploring. At the very least, provide an hour of free flight time before breakfast and another hour of free flight time before dinner.</p><p>You'll also want to provide these birds many perches of different materials and diameters, so their feet remain healthy. A climbing ladder, swings, anda slew of fun toysto beat up and chew on will also make the eclectus happy.</p><p>If provided with enough stimulation, they do a better job than many parrots at keeping themselves occupied when you're not around. The more challenges you can give these smart birds, the better.</p><p>Social, affectionate, and loves attention</p><p>Intelligent, generally, a great talking parrot</p><p>Quieter parrot than the other talking species</p><p>Needs an aviary or large cage to thrive</p><p>Does not like chaotic environments or constant loud sounds</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Eclectus Parrot </h2><p>Potential owners should spend time with several different birds, if possible, to find the one with a matching personality. Eclectus parrots are not as common as others, so you may have to seek out a specialty pet shop or breeder.</p><p>On average, breeders sell eclectus parrots from $1,000 to $3,000.</p><p>Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. Make sure the breeder is knowledgeable about their birds and is forthcoming about their breeding practices and the origin of their birds. They should provide you with helpful information for raising eclectus parrots and tell you about the bird's daily routine.</p>",1303

The yellow-collared macaw is a lively, engaging bird that can make an extraordinary companion for the right owner.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Yellow-collared macaw, golden-collared macaw, yellow-naped macaw, Cassin's macaw</p><p>Scientific Name: or</p><p>Adult Size: 15 to 17 inches, weighing between 8 and 10 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: Upwards of 50 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Yellow-collared macaws are native to central South America. Their range includes parts of Bolivia and Brazil as well as northern Paraguay and Argentina. In the wild, yellow-collared macaws form tight bonds with their mate and are rarely apart, even when in a flock. They nest in tree cavities within tropical forests and low woodlands. These birds are threatened and are verging on endangered.</p><p>The taxonomy of this species is in dispute. Some classify this bird in the genus as a smallparrot similar to severe macaws. Others place this bird in thegenus with other mini macaws like the Illiger's macaw, which is one of the yellow-collared's closest relations. The yellow-collared was formerly named something unrelated to bothwhich confuses matters even more.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Affectionate, but somewhat mischievous, the yellow-collared macaw has a reputation for being an intelligent and resourceful little parrot. It thrives on attention from its owner andwill seek that attention by any means necessary. Expect a greeting when you get home and lots of love and affection, whether you want it or not.</p><p>Although some are one-person birds, most yellow-collared macaws make extraordinary family pets. It helps when a bird is socialized young. They are generally friendly by nature. These traits are extensions from their pairing and flocking instincts, which they will gladly extend to their human flock.</p><p>Given the right amount of training, discipline, and love, these birds can become loyal and affectionate pets that form deep and long-lasting bonds with their owners. However, if this bird does not get consistent training from a young age, then it can be a territorial, nippy bird.</p><p>While yellow-collared macaws are generally not as noisy as larger macaws, they are more than capable of being quite loud when the mood strikes. Some people even compare their call to a gull. This noise level makes them not suitable for apartment or condominium living.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Many yellow-collareds are gifted talkers. They are capable of saying several words and phrases. Some owners have noted that the yellow-collared macaw can speak with more clarity than larger species. Even so, noparrotis ever guaranteed to talk. Do not buy a bird for its talking ability alone.</p><h2>Yellow-Collared Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Yellow-collaredmacaws have primarily green bodies in various shades. The green can be a little darker than some parrots, though they are shades of olive and lime green. They get their common name from striking yellow bands around the back of their necks (the nape). The birds' long maroon tails have a bright blue hue on the tips. When in flight, you'll also notice yellow under its wings.</p><p>The forehead on this bird is a bluish-black color, which is a stark contrast to the large white eye patches that surround an orange iris. The beaks are mostly black, fading into a white point at the end of the upper mandible, and their feet are flesh-colored.</p><p>The males and females look alike because this is a monomorphic species of bird. DNA sexing or a surgical sexing procedure are the only ways to tell the sexes apart. Also, the color of this bird's plumage lacks luster as a young bird; its colors will become more vivid with age.</p><h2>Caring for a Yellow-Collared Macaw </h2><p>Yellow-collared macaws, like many other mini macaw species, have a reputation for attaching themselves to the person who cares for them most. They crave attention and interaction, and because of this, they're not the right choice if you don't have several hours a day to devote them.</p><p>These mini macaws are little escape artists, which stems from their curious and sometimes naughty personality.Make sure you provide a cage that is safe and secure.Though these are smaller parrots, they still need a large cage to explore and stretch their legs and wings. At the minimum, the cage should be 3 feet long by 3 feet wide and 6 feet tall.</p><p>Parrots tend to do better with positive reinforcement, so remember to ignore bad behavior and reward good. When your macaw gets a little unruly out of the cage, sometimes all it takes to correct the behavior is to place it back on its perch. With a bit of patience, it will learn what will keep you happy, which is all it wants.</p><p>Another essential is a dish of water for a birdbath. These macaws are delighted with water and will splash around to their heart's content if given a chance.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Although the range of wild yellow-collared macaws is relatively small, it spans several countries. The bird eats a great variety of local fruits, nuts, seeds, and vegetation. A pet yellow-collared should eat a diet that is just as varied.</p><p>Macaws, depending on their size, will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables per day. Provide fresh drinking water every day. Supplement that with seeds and nuts to keep the bird healthy and happy.</p><p>Never feed these birds avocados, chocolate, rhubarb, coffee beans, or alcoholic beverages as they can be toxic.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Yellow-collared macaws live to play. This macawneeds a minimum of 1 to 2 hours of playtime outside of the cage each day to let it stretch and exercise his legs, beak, and wings. This time is also an opportune moment for training, whether it be teaching the bird to talkor fun bird tricks. They love to clown around, and you'll have lots of fun bringing out this part of their personality.</p><p>When outside the cage, a sturdy play stand with a place for treats and toys is essential for these playful little acrobats. Good parrot toys should be tough and plentiful in and out of the cage. The yellow-collared macaw needs to stay busy, so the more bird-safe toys you can give your bird, the happier it will be.

Macaws are needy birds, requiring experienced or dedicated parrot handlers. This full-sized macaw tends to do well with families; these birds thrive on socialization and a lot of interaction with other birds or people. They are good talkers, friendly, and have rather amusing personalities.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Harlequin macaw</p><p>Scientific Name: Hybrid x</p><p>Adult Size: 35 and 40 inches long, weighing 2 to 3 1/2 pounds</p><p>Life Expectancy: 50 years, some may reach up to 80</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The word""harlequin""has two meanings that are very appropriate for this bird. In one sense, it refers to a joker or clown, which perfectly reflects its personality. It can also mean ""variations of color and pattern,"" an apt description for this beautiful, rainbow-colored parrot.</p><p>Only bred in captivity, it is very rare to find harlequin macaws in the wild. This bird is known as a first-generation hybrid because it comes from two ""true"" species of macaw, theblue and gold macaw and thegreenwing macaw. The result is a bird with the coloring and characteristics of both parent birds.</p><p>The harlequin is also crossed with other true and hybrid macaws to produce second-generation hybrids.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Hybrids like the harlequin macaw are ""the best of both worlds."" The parent species of the harlequin usually have laid-back, affectionate personalities with good speech abilities and high intelligence. They can be taught fun tricks like waving, dancing, fetching, and more.</p><p>While no two birds are the same, they're generally described as fun, friendly, and somewhat comical. Socialized with people from the start, these macaws will likely enjoy the company of many different individuals throughout their life. You do not want your birds to become one-person birds or develop a preference for either men or women, which can happen if they have limited exposure to one or the other.</p><p>A harlequin macaw will have moments of frustration and become cranky. Yet, it isan excellent choice for those who would like a large bird with an even temper and calm demeanor.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>All parrots tend to be loud, but macaws are the poster-birds for ear-shattering vocalizations. If you don't want your parrot to awaken you early every morning by screaming at the top of its lungs, do not get a macaw. (On the upside, you will never miss an early morning flight if you have one of these birds as an alarm clock!) Also, if you are looking for a conversational parrot, macaws are the way to go. These birds can develop a vocabulary of 15 or so words with training.</p><h2>Harlequin Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Harlequin macaws have a wide variation in their colors and patterns. They are often mistaken for Catalina macaws, which are another hybrid with similar coloration.</p><p>A harlequin's coloring depends mostly on if the blue and gold or greenwing was the male parent. Males have dominant genes. This difference is most prevalent in the color of a harlequin's breast and belly. With a blue and gold father, the breast will be red-orange. If the father is a greenwing, the breast feathers will be a lighter orange.</p><p>Most harlequins have striking tones of green and blue on their backs. They also tend to have gold feathers on the underside of their tail feathers. Males and females look the same, and without genetic or surgical sexing, it's nearly impossible to know the sex of harlequins.</p><h2>Caring for the Harlequin Macaw </h2><p>Harlequin macaws require a lot of socialization and handling, so expect to spend time with the bird daily. A macaw that becomes bored or feels neglected can act out by biting, destroying things around the house, or resort to self-mutilation and feather plucking.</p><p>These birds need a large cage that is at least 5-foot square and 8-foot high placed in a draft-free location. It should include a perch and plenty of stimulating toys to keep it occupied while confined. The cage needs to be cleaned at least every two months or more oftenif it gets soiled quicker. Your bird will appreciate water to bathe in as well as occasional misting.</p><p>Before rushing out to buy a harlequin macaw, think seriously about the commitment involved in keeping such a bird. Not only can these birds live for five decades or more, butthe costs of veterinary bills, high-quality feed, toys, and cages add up quickly. If you feel that you wouldn't be able to provide a bird with the best of everything, consider holding off on adopting one until you can.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Generally speaking, if you take good care of your macaw, it will remain healthy. However, even with the best hygiene, some diseases can still occur. There are also behavioral problems that they can develop. If your bird gets bored or feels neglected by you, it may resort to feather plucking or skin picking.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Macaws are a very high energy bird. For good health, they will need foods rich in oils and calories. In the wild, macaws eat a variety of palm nuts, seeds, and fruit.</p><p>Feed harlequin macaws a diet that includes a high-quality seed and formulated pellet mix. It's also important to include daily servings of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Each macaw, depending on its size, will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables per day. It will also need fresh drinking water every day.</p><p>Provide a variety of fruits on a rotating schedule, such as apples, pears, plums, cherries, grapes, oranges, bananas, mangos, papayas, and even berries, such as strawberries and blueberries. Feed vegetables like carrots, sweet potatoes, cucumbers, zucchini, dark green leafy veggies, many garden vegetables, and even dandelions and chickweed. Never feed avocado; it is toxic to birds.</p><p>To make food prep more manageable, you can make the fruit and vegetable salad ahead of time and portion out each day's rations using the ""chop"" concept.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Pet parrots are prone to obesity and harlequin macaws need plenty of exercise. Activities help maintain their physical health and provides much-needed mental stimulation as well. You can keep your harlequin macaw occupied by handling it daily and providing it with plenty of toys.</p><p>Prepare to set aside a minimum of 2 to 4 hours per day for the supervision of the bird while it plays outside of its cage. In additionto preventing weight gain, adequate exercise helps stave off boredom.</p><p>Outside of the cage, a sturdy play stand can become your bird's favorite place to hang out. It may take a few times to remind it that this is where it needs to be, but the birds are smart and can pick up on it quickly. It will enjoy the view and be able to feel part of the family.</p><p>They thrive on being part of a flock (in this case, your family); it's a good idea to try to include your bird in as many family activities as possible.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Intelligent and can speak up to 15 words</p><p>Can be loud, so not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Needs 2 to 4 hours of supervised, out-of-cage time</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Harlequin Macaw </h2><p>Pricing for harlequin macaws ranges from $3,500 to $5,000, depending on if the bird is hand-tamed and the reputation of the breeder. As this bird is a long-lived bird, you may find this bird listed by adoption agencies and rescues. These birds may outlive their original owners, and living situations change for some owners who can no longer care for their macaw.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable by asking how long they've been breeding and working with macaws. When selecting your bird, look for thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1290

These compact and playful parrots make excellent pets that form solid bonds with their owners. Capable oflearning many tricksand behaviors, they can become good talkers with practice. This species is an excellent option for a bird lover who wants amacawbut does not have enough space for one of the big guys.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Hahn's macaw, red-shouldered macaw</p><p>Scientific Name: (formerly )</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches, 5 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Hahn's macaw is one of two varieties of red-shouldered macaws. The noble macaw is the other, and both are native to northern South America. The Hahn's subspecies is named for German zoologist Carl-Wilhelm Hahn, who cataloged birds from the New World with depictions and descriptions.</p><p>In the wild, they livein Brazil, Guyana, and Venezuela. They're most likely to be found in the tropical lowlands, though these parrots also enjoy the savannas and swamplands. Hahn's macaws tend to form small flocks in their natural habitat. This macaw's green feathers blend perfectly into the bright foliage of these areas.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Intelligent and charming, Hahn's macaws are popular pets. Be aware, however, that while they may be small, they pack all the personality of a larger parrot into their compact body. Expect many fun-filled hours watching their spirited antics.</p><p>Their compact size makes them suitable for bird lovers who live in smaller spaces or anyone with children. However, these birds are not suited for apartment living; they can be quite noisy when they feel like it.</p><p>Overall, the Hahn's macaw tends to be a very gentle bird. If you adopt a young bird, it may nip a bit, but they usually grow out of that habit. They will also calm down as they mature. When socialized, they can be sweet little birds that get along well with children as long as both parties interact appropriately with one another.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Hahn's macaws can be excellent talkers. With training, males and females can learn many words and phrases usually in a high-pitch but clear voice. But like the bigger macaws, Hahn's macaws are screamers. And, if you get a pair of Hahn's macaws, the noise will be twice as loud. Expect that this bird will assume the role of your morning alarm clock at sunrise.</p><h2>Hahn's Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>Mature Hahn's macaws are primarily green with a darker greenish-blue cap of feathers on their foreheads. They have a spot of bright red on the undersides of their wings, whichexplains their ""red-shouldered macaw"" nickname.</p><p>This bird's beak is black with a beige to white color in the upper beak. Their eyes are a burnt orange color, framed by the macaw's classic white eye-rings.</p><p>Hahn's macaws have black feet that seem to be oversized for their small body, though they are quite agile. To accommodate climbing and the handling of food and other objects, two of their toes point forward while two toes point toward the back. You can't tell males and females apart by looking at them. For accurate sexing, this species requires genetic testing or surgical sexing.</p><p>These macaws are sometimes mistaken for noble macaws. The Hahn's macaw is smaller, and the noble macaw's beak is entirely beige. If you are familiar with sun conures, Hahn's macaws are about the same size.</p><h2>Caring for the Hahn's Macaw </h2><p>Like their larger macaws cousins, Hahn's macaws have the same social, dietary, and exercise requirements. If you think that a Hahn's macaw is for you, make sure you have plenty of time to devote to training and bonding with your bird. A bored or neglected Hahn's macaw can become angry, destructive, or depressed. If you do not spend time with your bird, plan for bird bites, damaged property, and getting frustrated with your bird.</p><p>Birds left alone for long periods are prone to self-mutilation or feather plucking, which can snowball into more severe health problems.</p><p>Hahn's macaws do not require a very large cage like other macaws, however, they do need ample space. The cage should be large enough for the bird to fully expand its wings without touching the sides.Expect to get a cage that is 3-feet tall, long, and wide.</p><p>Prices for veterinary bills, quality feed, toys, and cages add up quickly. If you can't give your bird the best of everything, consider holding off on getting one until you can. Or, choose a pet that might be low-maintenance.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like other macaws, Hahn's macaws are prone to self-mutilation/feather plucking, overgrown beaks, nutritional disorders, proventricular dilatationdisease (a digestive disorder, also called macaw wasting syndrome), and psittacosis (a common avian bacterial infection).</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>These birds spend most of their mornings foraging for food, including berries, fruits, flower buds, nuts, seeds, and, occasionally, insects. You can sometimes find them on clay cliffs. The clay is a dietary supplement that helps remove any toxins they may pick up from their usual food sources.</p><p>In captivity, Hahn's macaws eat a high-quality pellet diet. This staple is in addition to daily servings of fresh fruits and vegetables, which make mealtime a fun spectacle to watch. Macaws, depending on their size, will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables per day. Provide fresh drinking water every day.</p><p>These parrots will be delighted with dark greens like kale and spinach as well as broccoli, carrots, squash, and even some chili peppers. For fruits, consider staples like apples, peaches, oranges, and pineapple. Many Hahn's also like bananas and figs. Just be sure to clean up any fruit leftovers to keep the cage clean and free of ants or mold.</p><p>Some parrots can become picky eaters, but you can diversify their diet by introducing new foods slowly. Do not feed these birds avocados, chocolate, or alcoholic beverages as they can be toxic.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like all parrots, wild Hahn's macaws fly for long distances every day. In captivity, a Hahn's macaw also needs anadequateamount of time out of the cage to play,exercise, and stretch its muscles. Provide your parrot with at least two hours of supervised out-of-cage playtime a day.</p><p>Social and intelligent, Hahn's macaws respond quickly to training which gives birds mental stimulation and keeps them from getting bored. You will have a lot of fun teaching these little birds tricks. Introduce new tasks throughout their lives to keep them mentally engaged.</p><p>With these parrots, it's best to ignore unwanted behaviorincluding excessive noise. Scolding has the opposite effect; it shows the bird that loud, stern squawking is an acceptable form of communication. Your best approach is positive reinforcement. Reward good behavior and quiet moments, and your little bird will start to understand what is acceptable behavior. They aim to please their keepers and handlers.</p><p>Social, friendly, can get along with children</p><p>Intelligent, can learn to talk and do tricks</p><p>Smaller size, does not need a typical macaw cage</p><p>Can be noisy, not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Requires at least 2 hours of supervised out-of-cage time</p><p>Can be nippy as a young bird</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Hahn's Macaw </h2><p>Many birds are targeted for illegal pet trade, so make sure your bird is captive-bred. Large pet stores rarely sell Hahn's macaws. You can likely find them at avian-specialty stores, bird breeders, as well as rescue and adoption organizations.The price ranges from $800 to $2,000.</p><p>If you are going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable. Ask how long they have been breeding and tour their facility. Make sure that the bird you want to take home is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1270

Macaws are beautiful, exotic-looking birds with large beaks, bright feathers, long tails, and light or white facial patches. Most of these species are big, friendly, and extraordinarily noisy, although there are a handful of miniature species. They require a lot of space to live healthy, active lives. It is common to deed pet macaws in wills and end of life plans as these birds may outlive their owners,though disease and poor nutrition can shorten their lifespan.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name: Macaw</p><p>Adult Size: Larger macaw species range from about 20 inches (military macaws) up to 42 inches (hyacinth macaws) including their long tails; mini macaws are more manageable at 10 to 20 inches in length.</p><p>Life Expectancy: 30 to 50 years; the larger the macaw, the longer the life expectancy.</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Macaws are large, colorful South American parrots. Europeans learned about these ""New World"" parrots from Christopher Columbus' journey logs in the 15th century.</p><p>Most species of macaws are endangered (hyacinth, red-fronted and blue-throated), and a few (the Spix's macaw and glaucous macaw) are almost certainly extinct. Their dwindling numbers are a result of the loss of their habitat through deforestation and illegal trapping for the pet trade.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn 7 Important Things About Owning a Macaw</h3><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Macaws are playful and active,and they have exuberant personalities that match their size. A well-cared-for macaw that receives appropriate nutrition, mental stimulation, enrichment, attention, and plenty of space for exercise makes a unique, long-lived companion that is affectionate and loyal.</p><p>However, their size and personalities can also make them challenging pets. Macaws that are not regularly handled or have hormonal imbalances, drastic environmental changes, or lack of mental stimulation can become aggressive, territorial, destructive, and problematic.</p><p>It is best to start training these intelligent birds from birth. Early training should focus on hand-feeding, not nipping or biting, no screaming, and eventually, teaching your bird to talk or sing. As you develop a rapport with your bird, you may even share jokes and enjoy various types of interactive play.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Macaws are loud and noisy. Their vocalizations can be more than some people can tolerate, and they can scream when they want to. If you can't deal with noise or if you have nearby neighbors, then a macaw is not your ideal pet.</p><p>They can learn to say words and mimic your speech, but they do not speak as clearly as some other pet bird species. However, with consistent training, the blue-and-gold is the best talking large macaw. The Hahn's macaw is best talking mini macaw.</p><h2>Macaw Colors and Markings </h2><p>There are several species of macaws in the wild, but the ones most commonly in the pet trade are large, colorful macaws. Scarlet, military, blue and gold, and hyacinth macaws are the common pet macaw species. Mini macaws are harder to find but include species such as Hahn's, Illiger's, and yellow-collared macaws.</p><p>There are so many color variations; macaw plumage seems to include every color of the rainbow. In addition to the 17 species, there are numerous colorful hybrids, including the rainbow macaw, more commonly known as the Catalina.</p><p>Macaws are dimorphic, meaning you cannot tell the sexes apart by looking at them. To figure this out, the bird needs genetic testing or a surgical sexing procedure.</p><h2>Caring for a Macaw </h2><p>Macaws need a large and durable cage, so be prepared to make a significant investment. Mini macaws can live in a cage sized for Amazon parrots (2 feet by 3 feet and 4 feet tall). Larger macaws will need a cage that is at least 3 feet by 4 feet and 5 feet tall. The cage must be strong enough to withstand the significant beak strength of macawsa stainless steel or wrought iron cage is a good investment. You will also need to offer your bird a play gym or out-of-cage perch or play stand.</p><p>Provide a wide variety of wooden toys or plain, untreated chunks of wood for the bird to chew on a rotational basis. Toys meant to be taken apart to get at a treat are also a good choice, as are hanging toys and toys to climb on.</p><p>Macaws can be messy and destructive, so provide heavy-duty toys to divert your bird away from your wooden furniture or other enticements around the house. You can even make your own macaw toys and utilize recyclable, yet safe, materials such as phone books and tissue boxes.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Macaws are usually hardy, long-lived birds. Their most significant health issue is not physical but emotional. As intelligent, social beings, macaws are prone to boredom and loneliness. A depressed macaw will self-injure by pulling out its feathers. There are two simple solutions to this problem: Either get more than one macaw or spend a great deal of time interacting with your pet. Either way, you will have a loud, highly interactive home life.</p><p>To ensure your pet's health, find a local avian vet where you can build an ongoing relationship. Your pet should visit the vet regularly to check for any signs of disease or depression.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, macaws eat a variety of seeds, plants, fruits, and nuts.As pets, a formulated pelleted food should be the basis for your macaw's dietsupplemented with a wide range of healthy fresh fruits and vegetables.</p><p>Pellets should comprise 50 percent of their food. Seeds and nuts should be no more than 10 percent of their diet (as they are too high in fat). The rest of the menu should consist of fresh fruit and vegetables.</p><p>The average healthy macaw will consume approximately 10 to 15 percent of its body weight daily. For reference, the larger scarlet macaw weighs about 2 pounds.These proportions translate to mean that the bird will eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of parrot mix and about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of fruit and vegetables every day. You can feed it once in the morning upon waking and at dusk before it goes to sleep.</p><p>You can offer your macaws a small portion of whatever you are eating, as long as it does not include any chocolate, avocado, caffeine, salt, or sugar. These birds tend to like cooked pasta, applesauce, and cereal as treats.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Macaws need much more room than a cage will provide to explore, spread their wings, and be mentally and physically healthy. Unless you have a free-flight aviary as its enclosure, plan on your macaw spending more time outside of its cage than in it. Birds are flock species and are also very affectionate, so they require at least 2 to 4 hours of attention from their owners or another bird to be happy.</p><p>Beautiful and intelligent</p><p>Can talk and mimic human sounds</p><p>Long-lived</p><p>Tendency for loud squawks and screams</p><p>Requires at 2 to 4 hours of daily exercise, mental stimulation</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Macaw </h2><p>Before you get a macaw, consider your space and time commitment. Frankly, if you don't have space for a large bird, don't get one.</p><p>Macaws are often available in pet stores, and older birds are usually available for adoption. You can also purchase a macaw from an avian breeder.</p><p>Smaller macaws can cost about $1,000 while larger macaws can run about $2,000. Hybrids may cost up to $5,000 or more. Before you buy, meet your prospective pet. The bird you choose should be bright-eyed and healthy with full plumage. Spend some time together to be sure you are a good match. Remember that a macaw can be a pet for a lifetime, so make a fully informed choice.</p>",1262

Moluccans are a cuddly bird that tends to get clingy at times. As pets, they want to be as close to their human mate as they naturally would with a mate in the wild. This bird needs a dedicated owner. This parrot stands out from the rest because of their salmon-pink feathers and brilliantly colored crest. Their beauty rivals their boisterous, comical personalities.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Moluccan cockatoo, salmon-crested cockatoo</p><p>Adult Size: 20 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 70 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>This species is native to the Moluccas (Maluku Islands) in Indonesia. They live in the lowlands and form large flocks. Farmers sometimes consider them a nuisance. Moluccans separate from the flock when they form a mating pair during the breeding season. They mate for life and can get very depressed after losing a mate. Due to habitat loss and trapping for the pet trade, Moluccan cockatoos are an endangered species. Only captive-bred birds should be available to keep as pets.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Sweet and affectionate are understated descriptions. This cockatoo loves to be loved and wants nothing more than someone (bird or person) to be with at all times. As a pet, the Moluccan tends to turn into a one-person bird.</p><p>Moluccans are brilliant birds that thrive on challenges. They can learn to dance and do tricks and acts like an entertaining comedian when in a good mood.</p><p>While Moluccans are known to be extremely affectionate, males may get aggressive as they age. Any cranky cockatoo can bite, which is why they are not the right pet for families with children. This bird's powerful beak is capable of cracking open tough nuts.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Moluccans are not the best talking parrot. They can mimic some sounds,though many owners say that it's more like yelling than talking. These birds are also screechers and will scream for attention when unhappy or no apparent reason. They are noisy, so they are not ideal for anyone with close neighbors.</p><h2>Moluccan Cockatoo Colors and Markings </h2><p>This species is easy to recognize by the bright pink feathers that adorn the base of its crest. It's barely noticeable when the feathers are flat, but when the bird is excited, afraid, or angry, the crest will raise and show off its true beauty. Among the cockatoo species, their crest is one of the fullest, only rivaled by the umbrella cockatoo.</p><p>Besides the pop of color on their heads,Moluccan cockatoos are primarily white with salmon-colored feathers on their chests and wings. They have a beautiful pale yellow to peach color underneath their wings. Their beaks and feet are black but often appear gray due to the natural powdery down that the bird sheds.</p><p>You can tell the sexes apart when the bird has matured to at least 3 years old. Male cockatoos have black eyes and females have brownish-colored eyes.</p><h2>Caring for Moluccan Cockatoos </h2><p>Moluccan cockatoos bond strongly with their owners. Do not get a Moluccan cockatoo unless you can be sure you will be home most of the time with it. If your lifestyle does not allow for this, consider getting two Moluccans. A pair will keep each other entertained. The trade-off is that owning two of these feisty birds is an even more significant commitment than one.</p><p>Moluccans will do best in the largest cage possible. If you can make the bird's home an aviary or a full room, your bird will be happier. The cage should be sturdy and able to withstand the cockatoo's destructive nature. Address its pent-up energy by providing plenty of toys and activity during its daily, supervised playtime.</p><p>All cockatoos emit a dusty powder. The birds produce it naturally to help preen its feathers. You can expect a light dusting of this powder on any surface the bird is near; be ready to clean often. This powder may be problematic for some people with allergies.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Moluccan cockatoosare prone to pulling out their feathers if not offered enough mental and physical activity or if their human mate does not spend sufficient time socializing with it.</p><p>Otherconditionsfound incockatoosinclude psittacine beak and feather disease (PBFD), fatty liver disease, and obesity. You can curb the risk of weight-related illness if you monitor fat intake and keep it low.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild,Moluccans eat seeds, fruits, nuts, and insects. Like all members of the cockatoo family, Moluccans can suffer health problems if they gain too much weight. Since Moluccans are not getting as much exercise as they would if they were in the wild, owners need to ensure these birds get a well-balanced diet and cut back on high-fat foods like seeds.</p><p>A formulated pellet diet should make up 75 percent of its food source. The other 25 percent should be bird-safe fruits and vegetables, such asbananas, apples, carrots, and kale. Thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables to protect your bird against pesticides and bacteria.</p><p>To start, offer approximately 1/4 cup of formulated diet and 1/4 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables daily. If the bird consumes all of its food, add small amounts as desired. Treats such as seeds, nuts, and table foods may be given in small quantities, especially as rewards for good behavior. Never feed birds avocados or chocolate, as these foods are toxic to them.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Moluccan cockatoos are an active bird. They need plenty of exercise to maintain their mental and physical well-being. Let your bird play and stretch its muscles. Give it between three and four hours outside the cage daily. It doesn't have to be in one long stretch.</p><p>Designate the bird's out-of-cage time in a safe, enclosed area where your bird won't hurt itself or escape from the house. You can also play to its foraging instinct and hide food as a game. The bird will enjoy the challenge.</p><p>Ensure your Moluccan cockatoo has bird-appropriate chew toys to exercise its beak. A bored cockatoo is likely to chew on whatever's available; this can include walls and furniture made of wood. Bird toys deter this unwanted behavior, though the bird will go through them quickly. Expect to have a ready toy supply available as back-ups or for rotating through.

Describe your lifestyle and discuss if they think this bird is a good fit for you. It's always better to check out a bird in advance and decide against adoption than to take one home and become overwhelmed.</p><p>Sadly, this species has a very high abandonment rate because they do demand far more attention than people think. It's unfair to these very sensitive birds. They are also a long-lived species, able to live up to 70 years.</p><p>Make sure that the bird you want to take home is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1253

You will also notice that they're great at alerting you to danger, a wild instinct that is accompanied by loud calls.</p><p>They do not have a reputation for being very affectionate, though females tend to form a stronger bond with owners while males are more easy-going. They are generally a low-maintenance bird; if there is really such a thing. Despite their aloof personalities, they do require a lot of time and attention.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>The Indian ringneck is one of the best talking birds among the domestic species. They can typically start speaking between 8 months and 1 year old, and they can learn more than 200 words. The bird can range from an average speaking level to yelling or screeching, but they are more generally known for their intelligence and quick learning when it comes to speech.</p><h2>Indian Ringneck Parakeet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Ringnecks are available in shades ranging from bright yellows, greens, and blues, to albinos, cinnamons, and lutinos. Though the color mutations are common, the typical coloring of this species is bright lime green with blue tail feathers and yellow under the wings.</p><p>They are known as a dimorphic species, meaning that its colors and markings can determine a bird's sex. Males sport deep red beaks, black facial markings, and three bands of color around their necks. The black ring develops at about 18 months, and blue and pink rings appear by the time they reach 3 years old. Females, while still beautiful, lack the facial and collar bands, although some do display a slight darkening of color around their necks.</p><h2>Caring for the Indian Ringneck Parakeet </h2><p>With adequate attention, handling, and love, an Indian ringneck parakeet can quickly become a beloved companion and family member. They enjoy learning new things and are exceptionally proficient with owners who want to challenge their intelligence. That's one reason they develop such large vocabularies and are great at bird tricks.</p><p>If you notice any aggressive behavior, it's best to avoid scolding as the bird can develop a lifetime fear of people. The best way to handle this bird is to ignore bad behavior and use positive reinforcement for good behavior.</p><p>The cage for this bird needs to be larger than you might expect. It should accommodate its long tail and let the bird hop around and play when you're not around. Make sure the bar spacing isn't large enough for them to get stuck in or escape through; the ideal size is 1/2-inch to 5/8-inch spacing.</p><p>Clean the food and water bowl daily, perches and toys weekly, and the floor monthly. Once a year, plan on taking everything outside to be hosed down.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>While the Indian ringneck parakeet is generally known to be a healthy pet bird, they are prone to common diseases like psittacosis, polyomavirus, aspergillosis, and a number of bacterial infections. If bored, left alone for too long, or depressed, this bird may turn to self-destructive behaviors such as feather plucking.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Wild Indian ringnecks usually feast on a diet of fruits, vegetables, nuts, berries, and seeds. They also enjoy the nectar from flowers and the flowers themselves.</p><p>While most vets agree that it is best for captive birds to eat a nutritionally balanced pelleted diet, a ringneck will appreciate a variety of fruits and vegetables in their diet. Leafy greens and vegetables are crucial for any companion parrot to maintain a nutritionally sound diet, and the Indian ringneck parakeet is no exception. They can also eat healthy cooked food you would eat and are particularly fond of chicken, though beans, grains, and rice are also acceptable. Avocados, rhubarb, chocolate, and other common foods are toxic to birds, however, so be careful.</p><p>Some ringneck owners find that their bird will sort out and leave behind pellets if it's mixed with seeds. These birds seem picky about eating pellets. If you find that to be the case, offer pellets and seeds separately and rotate them on a regular schedule. They usually come around to pellets. As a rule of thumb, start off by offering your bird 1/4 cup of pellets and 1/4 cup of fruits and vegetables daily. Increase the amount as needed. Remove the uneaten foods to prevent spoilage.</p><p>As with all birds, food and water containers should be emptied, cleaned,and refilled daily to reduce the risk of bacterial growth and infection.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Parakeets are very active birds. As with most other bird species, it is a good idea to have a safe area for the pet to play and stretch its wings out of its cage for at least 3 hours each day.</p><p>Ringnecks also have powerful jaw muscles to maintain. It is wise to provide an array of chewable toys, perches, and cage accessories, so the bird is less likely to gnaw on something valuable or dangerous. This species enjoys puzzles and any complex toys you can find, which should help keep the bird busy as well.</p><p>Providing a mister and a dish of water to bathe in will also keep your feathered friend very happy.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Intelligent and can speak up to 200 words</p><p>Can be loud, so not well-suited for apartments</p><p>Can be more dependent on their owners than other birds</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy an Indian Ringneck Parakeet </h2><p>Indian ringnecks are relatively common in the United States and can be rescued, adopted, or purchased at verified organizations like RescueParrots.org or adoption websites like Petfinder. Pricing ranges from $400 to $500, though you can expect to pay up to $700 depending on the organization and the bird.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable by asking them how long they've been breeding and working with Indian ringneck parakeets. Ask for a tour, but don't be alarmed if you are unable to tour the facilities in which they keep the birds. Many reputable breeders opt to work under closed aviaries, which prevents diseases from infecting the flock.</p><p>Also, make sure that the bird you want to take home is as healthy. Make sure the parakeet is alert, active, and exhibits all thesigns of a healthy bird, such as bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1437

Some nest communities can grow to the size of a compact car.</p><p>A hardy bird, feral colonies of Quakers also live in many urban areas throughout the world. In some places, particularly the southern U.S., wild Quaker populations pose a risk to crops and native bird species.</p><h3>Click Play to Learn More About the Charming Quaker Parrot</h3><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Quakers are very confident and social birds by nature. These birds are delightfully entertaining; they're like little clowns. They have the personality of large birds in a little bird's body.

Mimicking sounds and singing are other talents of this little beauty. Quakers are little chatterboxes, especially when you get more than one bird in a room.</p><p>The loudness of this parrot is subjective. Some owners say that it's a quiet bird, while others think they're too noisy. They do not make ear-piercing screams like other parrots, but they will call out on occasion. Their noise level should not bother the neighbors.</p><h2>Quaker Parrot Colors and Markings </h2><p>The typical colors of an adult Quaker are a vivid green on the head, wings, and back. The bird's most distinguishing feature is the gray breast, cheeks, and throat.

Their beaks are horn-colored and their feet are grey. Overall, they look like a stalky cockatiel.</p><p>Captive breeding programs have also produced a variety of beautiful color mutations in Quakers. One of the most popular mutations is a blue hybrid Quaker parrot developed in the early 2000s. Breeders have also created albino, cinnamon, lutino, and pied Quakers.</p><p>This bird is a monomorphic species, which means the males and females look exactly alike. The only way to know for sure the sex of your bird is through DNA sexing or a surgical sexing procedure.</p><h2>Caring for a Quaker Parrot </h2><p>Quakers are very active birds and need to have an adequate amount of space to play.

They will fight and even kill to protect their home.</p><p>If you have a dog or cat, you will also want to keep an eye on your Quaker. They can be somewhat fearless and try to take on even the biggest dogs.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The most common health issue with Quaker parrots is obesity which can lead to fatty liver disease and nutrient deficiency causing feather plucking. In most cases, you can avoid feather plucking if your birds receive sufficient exercise and social interaction with you. Self-mutilation is a common, though unhealthy, way that parrots deal with boredom and angst. Quakers are relatively easy to rehabilitate compared to other parrots.</p><p>Fatty liver disease is most often caused by eating high-fat foods, namely eating a seed-based diet. A well-balanced, varied dietwith seeds only given as occasional treatscan help keep your bird healthy.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Quakers are known to be excellent eaters and their diet should include the fruits, vegetables, and nuts they typically eat in the wild.</p><p>As a captive bird, their main diet item should be a high-quality, commercially formulated pellet mix. Provide a variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and healthy table food. Root vegetables, peppers, and colorful produce are critical in their diets.</p><p>Feed these birds about 3 tablespoons of pellets per day and offer at least a 1/4 cup of fresh fruits and vegetables in the morning. Discard the fresh foods that are not eaten by the end of the day. You can offer a second feeding of fruits and vegetables a couple of hours before bed.</p><p>Some Quakers tend to become overweight if allowed to indulge in too many fattening nuts and seed treats like sunflower seeds, peanuts, and millet.</p><p>As with all pet birds, fresh water should always be available.

These lively little parrots pack a lot of personality into a tiny bundle of feathers, and they're known to be the clowns of the bird world.</p><h3>What is a caique?</h3><p>Native to South America, caiques are a type of small parrot with short, square tails and prominent colors like green, black, yellow, and orange. While caiques do not typically speak words in the same manner that many other parrots do, they are known as a playful species that regularly whistles and chirps.</p><p>Caiques have easily made a place for themselves in the homes and hearts of countless bird enthusiasts. A caique would be the right choice for a family or personthat wants to keep a pair of birds.</p><h3>Breed Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Black-headed caique, white-bellied caique, seven-color parrot, dancing parrot, yellow-thighedcaique</p><p>Scientific Name: (black-headed), (white-bellied)</p><p>Adult Size: 9 to 10 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 25 to 40 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>In the wild, caiques call home the areas of South America north of the Amazon. Their range includes Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, and Suriname. They also live in parts of Brazil and Venezuela.</p><p>This species enjoys the swamps and tropical lowland forests. Often found in small flocks of about 30 birds or a pair, they're naturally very social birds and are rarely alone. The word ""caique"" comes from the indigenous Tupi language from Brazil, meaning ""aquatic bird."" These birds enjoy bathing.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Caiques are known for the strong bonds that they can form with humans. They love attention. They can be quite affectionate and enjoy time playing with a human companion or just sitting with them. If you're looking for a new best friend, this may be the species for you. They love to show off and are not called the ""dancing parrot"" for nothing. Quick learners, they're adept at picking up fun tricks and have great personalities.</p><p>Caiques are playful, comical little birds that enjoy activities and the opportunity to explore. Always on the move, they're one of the most energetic parrots and quite curious and mischievous. These birds can also become cranky at times and can nip or, in the least, find ways to use their beak when interacting with people.</p><p>As pets, caiques usually do well alone or in pairs, but be careful not to cage a caique with another species. They can become aggressive and deliver surprisingly harsh bites.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Some caiques may learn to speak a few words, but most prefer to stick to ""bird speak."" You'll enjoy their whistles and songs as well as the environmental sounds they mimic. Though they can get loud, they're generally known for a moderate noise level with soothing sounds in comparison to other parrots. At times, they may emit calls that are very high-pitched and shrill. Before committing to this species, make sure their noise level and vocal abilities are what you are looking for.</p><h2>Caique Colors and Markings </h2><p>The markings of a caique are distinct; they have more of a color-blocked look. Their heads, wings, bellies, and thighs tend to be a distinct color from other body parts with few gradients between the colors. They are often referred to as the seven-colored parrot due to the highly defined and colorful feathers. The black-headed and white-bellied caiques are the most common color variety.</p><p>Black-headed caiques have mostly black heads with orange or yellow cheeks and a green streak under their eyes. Their wings and upper tail feathers are a beautiful green and bright yellow on the thigh feathers and under their wings. They have a beige-whitecolored abdomen with gray legs and a gray beak. They are also called the seven-color parrot.</p><p>Subspecies of the white-bellied caique, specifically the yellow-thighed and yellow-tailed caiques, are becoming popular as well.</p><h2>Caring for Caiques </h2><p>Caiques must get regular, scheduled playtime. Shower this bird with lots of positive interaction. They are usually able to entertain themselves for short periods, making them a good choice for working bird owners.</p><p>They are also relatively small, which makes them appealing to those who dwell in apartments and condominiums. Despite their small size, caiques will do best in a small aviary or large cage. At a minimum, provide a cage that is at least 2 feet long and 2 feet wide by 3 feet tall. The spacing between the bars should be no more than 3/4-inch wide.</p><p>Since they are intelligent, they also make pretty good escape artists. Ensure their cage is sturdy and can keep these crafty birds safe. A wrought-iron cage is best since they often try to chew the bars.</p><p>Provide this bird a bathing dish with fresh water every day. They are very fond of splashing around in the water.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Caiques are generally healthy birds. However, this species is susceptible to polyomavirus, a potentially deadly virus mostly in young birds that causes severe intestinal issues and can affect the bird's heart, liver, and kidneys. At birth, the bird can get a vaccine to help prevent this disease. And, you can get an annual booster to help keep your bird healthy if your pet bird will come across other birds in their home environment.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, caiques eat seeds, berries, and fruit. As pets, feed them a high-quality extruded pellet. Supplement this with fruits, vegetables, nuts, and beans. As with all bird species, clean, fresh drinking water should be made available at all times.</p><p>Leafy green vegetables like Swiss chard, watercress, kale, or collard greens are nutritious additions to their diet. Fresh fruit makes a wonderful topping for the veggies. A dash of healthy seed such as chia seed here and there is fine but refrain from an all-seed diet, which does not meet their vitamin and mineral needs.</p><p>You can start by offering a 1/2 cup of parrot pellet and a 1/2 cup of fruit and vegetable salad upon waking in the morning. Scale back the amount you give your bird based on the amount of food eaten. If the bird eats everything, you can offer a second feeding a couple of hours before bedtime. By the end of each day, toss out any uneaten fresh foods. Keep an eye on your parrot's weight. If they are noticeably gaining or losing weight, adjust the food serving sizes.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Caiques are active little birds and are unique in that they seem to prefer to walk more often than fly. Caiques enjoy floor time and you will enjoy watching them on the floor or any large flat surface. They have a unique hop that is charming and endearing. They appear to be a windup tin toy that hops along in a very amusing way.</p><p>A caique should be given a minimum of 1 hour outside the cage each day to hop around and exercise its strong leg muscles and do a bit of supervised exploring in a bird-safe room. To safeguard the room, turn off ceiling fans, close all windows and doors, cover the fireplace, and remove all toxic plants and other pets.</p><p>As busybodies, these birds need plenty of stimulating toys. It may take some time to find your bird's favorite toys. They can be somewhat finicky and stubborn about their things. Playtime also helps the bird wear down its beak, which helps keep it in good shape. Rotate branches and toys regularly as they become worn out.</p><p>Social and affectionate</p><p>Can mimic sounds, perform tricks, and dance</p><p>Not a great talker</p><p>Does not get along with other bird species</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Caique </h2><p>Contact a parrot adoption or rescue agency that has caiques and ask if you can visit their birds. Seeing one of these parrots in its home environment will give you quite a bit of insight into what it's like to live with one.</p><p>Breeders sell caiques in the range of $1,000 to $2,000.</p><p>If you are considering abird breeder, make sure you interview the breeder, look at the general health of their birds, check out their living conditions, and talk to past customers. Signs you should avoid the breeder include cramped living conditions, inactive birds, and breeders who avoid your questions or do not seem to have much information on their birds.</p>",1362

Some jendays may become attached to a single person, but a majority should do well with a family unit and accept everyone as members of their flock.</p><p>Jendays can be very cuddly, often enjoying a ride on their handler's shoulder or inside their shirt. You will also find that they generally love to be petted and will bow their head when it's time for some affection.</p><p>Most people admire this bird's beauty and charming personality. Jenday conures are social birds that thrive on interaction. They may not be the best choice for those who have less than a few hours a day to spend with it.</p><p>Jenday conures are as intelligent as other members of the parrot family and can learn simple tricks and mimic sounds.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Conures mimic human speech likelarger parrots, but most jendays don't typically ""speak."" That doesn't mean they're not entertaining, though. Many pet jendays learn to repeat everyday household noises such as telephones and microwaves.</p><p>A flying flock of jenday conures are loud; they tend to call out during flight. Many conures become screamers if they feel neglected. If you have close neighbors, a conure might be considered a noisy nuisance.</p><h2>Jenday Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>Jenday conures have multi-colored plumage with a red-orange body and green wings and back. Its tail has blue feathers, and the wings are rimmed with an iridescent blue as well. Also called a yellow-headed conure, it has a yellow head with orange patches on the face.</p><p>A jenday's beak is black, and its feet and legs are gray. It's a monomorphic species, which means that DNA or surgical sexing is the only accurate way to tell males from females. Females have light brown irises and a grayish eye-ring, while males have darker brown irises and a white eye-ring. This small distinction is not enough for sexing.</p><p>Overall, jenday conures are very similar in size and appearance to sun conures. The easiest way to tell them apart is the jenday has green wings, while the sun's wings are primarily yellow.</p><h2>Caring for Jenday Conures </h2><p>To keep your bird happy and calm, plan to spend plenty of time with your birds. It's essential that the bird doesn't get bored or lonely; this can lead to destructive chewing and naughty behavior.</p><p>Though this is a small bird that would seemingly fit inside a cockatiel cage, it needs much more room than that. It should be at least big enough for the bird to flap its wings and move around freely. It would be best if has the ability to fly in its cage. These birds are incredibly active and known to get cranky in small spaces. The absolute minimum space should be 3 feet long and 2 feet wide and tall. The cage should be double its size if you choose to keep a pair.</p><p>Jenday conure pairs generally keep their affectionate, well-trained pet characteristics if both birds get proper attention. They can also be housed with another type of conure, particularly sun, gold-capped, and blue-crowned conures. Two conure species can interbreed, however, hybridization taints an already limited gene pool; it is not recommended. If a mix between a sun conure and jenday occurs, the hybrid is called a ""sunday.""</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Jenday conures are hardy birds that can quickly adapt to home life.</p><p>Signs that indicate this bird could be ill include lethargy, loss of appetite, difficulty breathing, and feather-loss or plucking. Many of these conditions are easily treatable. See an avian veterinarian if troublesome signs crop up.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Pet birds will have a better chance of meeting their nutritional requirements if they get plenty of variety in their diets.</p><p>In the wild, jenday conures primarily feast on fruit, nuts, and seeds. In captivity, they need a balanced, pelleted diet supplemented with nuts, seeds, and fresh fruit and vegetables. You can give them an unlimited amount of pellet food; they will only eat what they need. As for fresh fruits and veggies, offer about a 1/8 to 1/4 cup in the morning and at night. Seeds and nuts should be occasional treats.</p><p>Thoroughly wash their food bowls and cage regularly to prevent transmission of parasitic infections. Also, conures are so active that obesity is typically not as big of an issue as it is with other pet parrots.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like other conures, jendays need adequate space to fly, explore, and play. Allow your bird a minimum of two hours outside of its cage each day. The birds will learn to hang out on a play stand adorned with ropes, toys, and other interesting bird-safe trinkets. Be sure the out-of-cage time is in an area free of hazards like cats or other pets, ceiling fans, or open doors or windows to the outside world. You do not want an accidental bird escape.</p><p>Inside the cage, set up your bird with lots of fun activities. A swing is a must as these little parrots will quickly make it their home roost. Ladders, bells, and ropes will also provide a jungle gym experience.</p><p>Do not forget to get chew toys; they are voracious chewers and need to exercise their beaks on acceptable things rather than the cage, your furniture, or electrical wires. Wood toys and branches swapped out regularly should keep the bird engaged.</p><p>Smaller-sized parrot with a big personality</p><p>Cuddly, affectionate with its handlers</p><p>Can learn to do tricks</p><p>Can get loud and noisy, not recommended for apartment living</p><p>Not much of a talker, more a mimic</p><p>Some restrictions on ownership, depends on your local laws</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Jenday Conure </h2><p>Before you adopt a jenday, check with your local wildlife and game authorities about any legal restrictions on this species. Some areas require a permit to keep them while others may ban them outright. For example, in the United States, it is illegal to own one in New Jersey.</p><p>When choosing a bird, it is best to select a hand-fed baby or at least a young bird that has been handled regularly. The average cost for one of these birds is $600.</p><p>Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. Avoid a bird that is sitting quietly with puffed feathers; it might be ill. The bird's feathers should be smooth and shiny and lay down flat on the body. The feathers around the vent/cloaca (opening where bird expels feces and urine) should be clean, dry, and free of fecal matter. The scales on the feet should be smooth. Make sure its nails are in good condition, and Its beak is smooth and well-shaped. Its nostrils should be clear and clean.</p>",1243

These parrots are intelligent, trainable pets known for having playful personalities that are especially suitable for a family setting.</p><h3>What is a Conure Parrot?</h3><p>Conures are small-to-medium-sized parrots with vibrant feathers, long tails, and curved beaks. These birds are characterized by their talkative nature and active temperament.</p><p>Owners should be prepared; this bird is one of the loudest of all the medium-sized parrots. Conures are not good starter birds since they require a lot of consistent training, daily interaction, and constant socialization to stay tame and well-behaved.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Sun conure, sun parakeet</p><p>Adult Size: 12 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 30 years in captivity</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The sun conure is native to northeastern South America, includingVenezuela, northern Brazil, and Guyana. Found mostly in inland tropical habitats, the sun conure also may inhabit dry savanna woodlands and coastal forests. They usually inhabit fruiting trees and palm groves.</p><p>The population of this currently endangered bird is dwindling rapidly due to loss of habitat and trapping for the pet trade. According to the World Parrot Trust, populations have dipped drastically over the past three decades despite the U.S. import ban of 1992 and European Union ban in 2007.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>The sun conure is a playful, amusing bird that enjoys athletic tricks. These birds are smart, interactive, and easily trained. In general, it is a very affectionate and cuddly bird that is gentle to all members of the family as long as it's treated well. The bird is not without assertiveness, though; it can turn aggressive suddenly if provoked.</p><p>This parrot can go through nippy phases that can be hard on children as well as on adults.Even the tamest pet bird can get startled and bite. This is not a true reflection of its personality; it's a natural reaction.</p><p>Like all parrots, sun conures are social birds that need a considerable amount of interaction with their human owners to be happy.They are naturally playful and affectionate when they get the attention they need, making them uniquely suited for those who want a bird for steady companionship.</p><p>Keep in mind that the sun conure is extremely loud, capable of emitting ear-piercing screams. Its loud, shrill call is used in the wild to bring attention to important situations from miles away. Likewise, this bird can stand in as an excellent version of a watchdog for your home.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>In captivity, this bird's loud, harsh calls may elicit return calls from angry neighbors. This bird is not suitable for apartment or condo dwellers.You can't expect to ""train away"" their calls, but you can train them from early on to curb excessive screaming. They do express excitement and fear with shrill screams. Conures are not shy birds and will let you know vocally if they are bored or if their needs are neglected.</p><p>Sun conures are not known for their talking ability, but some birds demonstrate an uncanny ability to mimic other types of sounds, such as doorbells, microwave buzzers, and telephone chimes.</p><h2>Sun Conure Colors and Markings </h2><p>At maturity, a sun conure is bright orange and yellow with traces of green and blue. Juvenile sun conures are not nearly as colorful as adultsthis is a natural defense mechanism. The first feathers are olive green in color, changing to a mixture of yellowish-orange at around 6 months of age. Full-color plumage occurs at approximately 18 months to two years of age. Sun conures have black beaks and feet and characteristic white patches around each eye. The sexes are identical in color and markings. To determine sex, your bird would require genetic testing or a surgical sexing procedure.</p><h2>Caring for a Sun Conure </h2><p>The sun conure is an active bird that will be happiest in a roomy enclosure. At a minimum, give it a cage that is 30 inches by 30 inches in footprint with a height of at least 36 inches for a bird on the smaller size. Make sure the cage has relatively narrow bar spacing (3/4 to one inch) to prevent the bird from getting its head stuck between the bars.</p><p>As is true of most other parrot species, the sun conure needs safe out-of-cage areas to explore and investigate. This athletic bird loves to create its own tricks. Provide it a play gym on top of its cage so it can stretch its legs and wings.</p><p>Like most pet birds, sun conures require training if you want to have a positive and fun relationship with them. Use positive reinforcement techniques to train this parrot to do several athletic tricks. This bird will not respond well to scolding or any kind of negative reinforcement.</p><p>Sun conures tend to enjoy bathing and will splash about daily when provided with a shallow water bowl. They may also enjoy a spray shower from overhead misters as some other parrots do.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like other conures and parrots, the sun conure can be prone to feather picking. More often than not, this is a sign that the bird is bored or is not receiving the attention it needs.</p><p>Conures are also prone to avian viral conditions like proventricular dilatation disease and psittacine beak and feather disease. They can also be affected by psittacosis bacterial infection, beak malocclusion (beak overbite), and aspergillosis fungal infection. If you suspect your bird is ill, you will need an avian veterinarian or exotics specialist to check out your bird. You should plan on having annual exams with this specialized vet.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, sun conures primarily feast on fruit, nuts, and seeds. In captivity, they do best on a formulated, balancedpellet diet supplemented with fruits, leafy greens, and root vegetables. Slightly steamed sweet potatoes are an excellent food for your pet conure.</p><p>When it comes to pellet food, this should account for approximately 75-80% of the bird's diet. As for fresh fruits and veggies, offer about a 1/8 to 1/4 cup in the morning and at night.</p><p>Like other companion birds, a sun conure needs and appreciates treats, so make healthy choices for treats. Nuts and seeds are always a good choice for an occasional treat. Walnuts and almonds are excellent selections. If you would like to make feeding your feathered companion easier, try making a grain bake casserole dish. It freezes well for a healthy, portioned meal for your bird.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As with all birds, proper exercise is imperative to good health. Sun conures are, by nature, very active and need adequate space to fly, explore, and play.</p><p>Your sun conure should be allowed at least 3 hours out of the cage each day. Foraging and other forms of enrichment are essential for these intelligent birds. Make sure to provide the bird with a variety of interesting toys and change them at regular intervals to prevent your pet from growing bored.</p><p>Social, affectionate, and cuddly</p><p>Intelligent, can be taught tricks</p><p>One of the most vibrantly colored birds</p><p>Noisy, not well-suited for apartments or close neighbors</p><p>Not known for its talking ability</p><p>Can get nippy around children if provoked</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Sun Conure </h2><p>If you plan to buy a sun conure, make sure it is captive-bred certified. These birds can cost as much as $800 and higher.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that thebreeder is reputableby asking them how long they've been breeding and working with sun conures. Carefully inspect a bird before taking it home. Ahealthy birdis alert, active, has bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1241
75,https://www.thesprucepets.com/facts-about-sun-conures-390581,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Medium Birds Breeds,<h1>5 Interesting Facts About Sun Conures</h1>,"<h1>5 Interesting Facts About Sun Conures</h1><p>While most people are initially attracted the Sun Conures bird species for their stunning looks, those who fall in love with the species do so due to its many other endearing characteristics such as a playful personality and keen intelligence. Take a look at some of the facts listed below to learn more about Sun Conures and what it's like to keep them as pets.</p><h2>Size </h2><p>Coming in at around 12 inches in length from the beak to the end of the tailfeathers, the Sun Conure is a medium-sized bird with a nicely proportioned figure, healthy birds being neither slim nor stout in profile. They have a classic parrot look to them without the size and bulk of larger birds like Macaws or Cockatoos, making them very appealing to those who are drawn to the look of more exotic bird species but don't have the room to house and care for a very large bird.</p><h2>They Are Loud </h2><p>One thing that potential Sun Conure owners should realize is that these birds are extremely loud, and are not a good choice for those who live in apartments. They possess an ear-piercing scream that they will emit throughout the day, more notably at sunrise and sunset. Their contact call can carry for milesand helps them locate each other in the wild while out foraging for food during the day. In captivity, however, this level of noise can cause problems for those who live in close proximity to their neighbors.</p><h2>Lifespan </h2><p>Adopting a Sun Conure is no small commitmentwith proper care, these birds can have a lifespan of up to 30 years in captivity. Before you decide to take the plunge and bring a Sun Conure home, make sure that you are willing and able to commit to caring for your bird for at least this amount of time.</p><h2>They Can Learn to Talk </h2><p>0</p><p>While it's certainly not the case for all Sun Conures, some individual birds have learned to talk quite successfully, and have been able to amass a vocabulary of a few dozen words. In general, though, it's not reasonable to expect a Sun Conure to develop the talking prowess of other types of parrots like Amazons and Macaws.</p><p>More often than not, Sun Conures tend to prefer to mimic other types of sounds, such as whistles, microwaves, doorbells, and telephones. Some Sun Conures never mimic any sounds at alland prefer to stick to the normal range of vocalizations for their species.</p><h2>They Have Vivid Colors </h2><p>While their colors are somewhat similar to the equally popular Jenday Conure when they are juveniles, Sun Conures are widely regarded as the most colorful of all the Conure species. This is because a mature Sun Conure sports plumage in a variety of shades of red, yellow, green, orange, blue, and in some birds, tones of violet.</p><p>Another distinctive feature of the Sun Conure is the bare white patches of skin around the eyes, known as ""eye rings."" These patches are similar to the bare patches commonly noted in Macaw speciesand are seen by many as an attractive feature for a parrot to have.</p>",517
76,https://www.thesprucepets.com/cockatiels-as-pets-1236728,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Small Bird Breeds,<h1>Cockatiel: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Cockatiel: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>A cockatiel is a popular choice for a pet bird. It is a small parrot with a variety of color patterns and a head crest. They are attractive as well as friendly. Due totheir smaller size, cockatiel care and taming are easier than other parrot species. They are capable of mimicking speech, although they can be difficult to understand. These birds are good at whistling and you can teach them to sing along to tunes.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Cockatiel, tiel, quarrion (quarrian), weiro (weero)</p><p>Adult Size: 12 or 13 inches, weighing between 2 to 4 ounces</p><p>Life Expectancy: 15 to 20 years with proper care, and sometimes as long as 30 years though this is rare</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>In their native Australia, cockatiels are called quarrions or weiros. They primarily live in the Outback, a region of the northern part of the continent. Discovered in 1770, they are the smallest members of the cockatoo family. They exhibit many of the same features and habits as the larger bird. In the wild, they live in large flocks.</p><p>Cockatiels became popular as pets during the 1900s. They are easy to breed in captivity and their docile, friendly personalities make them a natural fit for home life. These birds can no longer be trapped and exported from Australia.</p><h3>Watch Now: How Are Cockatiels as Pets?</h3><h2>Temperament </h2><p>These little birds are gentle, affectionate, and often like to be petted and held. They are not necessarily fond of cuddling. They simply want to be near you and will be very happy to see you.</p><p>Cockatiels are generally friendly; however, an untamed bird might nip. You can prevent bad habits at an early age by ignoring bad behavior as these birds aim to please. Never scold the bird; this can cause it to become timid around people. Reward good behavior and disregard the bad.</p><p>Cockatiels are intelligent birds and can learn a variety of tricks over time. From waving and whistling to bell ringing, they're smart little birds that will enjoy a new challenge. Many cockatiels will even keep themselves occupied for hours talking to the ""other bird"" in a mirror.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Cockatiels vocalize and whistle but are not as loud as some other parrots. By reputation, males have the upper hand for mimicking speech and whistles. However, female cockatiels are no slouch; they are good at mimicry, too. Either sex may repeat sounds from your house, including alarm clocks, phones, and even wild birds outside.</p><h2>Cockatiel Colors and Markings </h2><p>Thewild cockatiel has agray body with a yellow face and crest and orange cheek patch. The colors on the face are brighter and more vivid in the male. The female has bars on the underside of the tail feathers.</p><p>Bred in captivity for the pet trade, several color mutations developed over the years.</p><p>Other mutations include emerald, creamface, pastelface, whiteface, and yellow cheek cockatiels.</p><p>Differences between males and females vary by coloration. These differences can sometimes be hard to distinguish, especially in young birds. For definitive sexing, consider genetic testing.</p><h2>Caring for the Cockatiel </h2><p>A pair of birds will make good company for each other. But, they may not bond as well with you or mimic speech and sounds. Keeping a single bird is fine, but you need to spend a significant amount of time interacting with the cockatiel daily. If your lifestyle makes this impossible, get a pair of birds to prevent loneliness and self-harming behavior.</p><p>These birds are naturally messy and they produce powdery dust on their feathers. It is used in grooming and may leave a powdery coating on cages and accessories. Bathe or spray your bird with water once a week. Regular cleaning of the cage is necessary. Many cockatiel cages come with a removable bottom tray to make the task easier.</p><p>Cockatiels are active and playful and should have a large cage. Provide a cage that is at least 20 inches square and 26 inches tall. The spacing on the cage bars should be no more than 3/4-inches wide. You do not want the bird to get its head caught in the cage. Horizontal cage bars offer the best opportunity for the bird to climb and get much-neededexercise. The cage should have enough space to place a couple of perches at different levels. The bird should be able to easily move between the perches.</p><p>Clip your cockatiel's wings and nails twice a year. You can do it yourself, but you must learn the proper method, or else it is very easy for these birds to bleed to death. If you're uncomfortable with this, an avian veterinarian or breeder can do it for you.</p><p>Cockatiels are subject to a few household dangers. Avoid placing the bird's cage in drafty areas or near the kitchen. Fumes from heated Teflon cookware can kill these birds.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>The most common health issue affecting cockatiels is nutritional deficiency. Too often, they only eat seeds. The vitamins and minerals found in fruits, vegetables, and a pellet-based diet are essential for preventing malnutrition.</p><p>Cockatiels are prone to getting fatty liver disease, which results from a high-energy diet rich in carbohydrates and fat, as well as limited or no exercise. To reduce the risk of your cockatiel getting this disease, make sure your bird gets a varied diet and keep it away from insecticides, pesticide residue on fruits and vegetables, and fumes from cleaning supplies.</p><p>Most birds are susceptible to respiratory diseases and psittacosis, a harmful bacterial infection that can cause respiratory symptoms like wheezing, sneezing, coughing, and nasal discharge. At the first sign of illness, take your bird to an avian veterinarian. Acting fast can save your bird's life.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Variety is the key to a healthy diet for any parrot, including cockatiels. Seeds can be a nutritious part of the diet, but they are high in fat. Seeds should be no more than 30 percent of the bird's diet. Pelleted diets are often the right choice for birds as they are nutritionally balanced and birds can't pick out their favorite seeds and leave the rest.</p><p>To make sure that your bird gets all the nutrients it needs, offer a variety of fresh vegetables and fruit. In general, a cockatiel eats about 1 tablespoon of food per day. This is why what goes into that tablespoon matters.</p><p>Provide a seed/pellet mixture every morning. Give as much as the bird will eat. Cockatiels are not inclined to overeat. You can put the food in a bowl or scatter it on the floor of the cage. These birds are natural foragers in the wild, where they eat grass seeds, fruits, and plants. Provide fresh fruits and vegetables in a bowl. Remove what they do not eat after an hour; do not feed your bird spoiling food.</p><p>If your bird prefers an all-seed diet, you will need to be persistent in getting them to eat from a more varied menu. Offer proteins such as hard-boiled eggs, legumes, and cooked meats in moderation. Sprouted seeds are also an excellent way to add variety to your bird's diet. Never feed avocados, chocolate, coffee, and salt; these items are toxic to birds.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>As with any parrot, activities will make a cockatiel happy and help maintain its physical and mental health. If your bird spends most of the time in a cage, be sure it's large enough for the bird to fly. Provide plenty of toys that can stimulate the bird's natural inclination to play. Perches, ladders, and toys should be plentiful but not to the point that it hinders the bird's movement around the cage.</p><p>If you can, give your cockatiel at least an hour outside the cage. Although this is not as crucial as it is with other parrots, out-of-cage helps with socialization and allows the bird to stretch its wings.</p><p>Smaller-sized parrot</p><p>Quieter bird that can learn to talk</p><p>Does not require a lot of outside-cage time</p><p>Can nip if not hand-raised or well trained</p><p>May not be affectionate or talk if housed with another cockatiel</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Cockatiel </h2><p>When choosing a bird, it is best to select a hand-fed baby or at least a young bird that has been handled regularly. Prices will vary with color, and you can expect to pay a bit more from a conscientious breeder. A well-handled young bird can cost $100 to $300.</p><p>Cockatiels are widely available atpet stores, but these birds may have an unknown history. As a result, they may be older, not used to being handled, and harder to tame.</p><p>Look for a bird that is bright, alert, and active. Avoid a bird that is sitting quietly with puffed feathers; it might be ill. The bird's feathers should be smooth and shiny and lay down flat on the body. The feathers around the vent/cloaca (opening where the bird expels feces and urine) should be clean, dry, and free of fecal matter. The scales on the feet should be smooth. Make sure Its nails are in good condition, and Its beak is smooth and well-shaped. Its nostrils should be clear and clean.</p>",1491

Its striking features and friendly personality make this bird a favorite among bird enthusiasts who consider the mynah one of the best avian mimics of human speech, second only to the gray parrot.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Mynah bird, myna bird, mina bird, maina bird, common mynah, hill mynah, Indian mynah</p><p>Scientific Name: (common mynah), (hill mynah)</p><p>Adult Size: 12 to 18 inches long</p><p>Life Expectancy: 12 to 25 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Mynah birds come from the Sturnidae or starling family of birds. A softbill species, this bird is native to Africa, India, southeast Asia, and Indonesia. It has been widely introduced and now lives in most of the world in the wild. In ancient Greece, the mynah bird was an aristocractic pet.</p><p>The word ""mynah"" comes from the Hindu word , and the Sanskrit word , which means ""delightful and fun-loving."" In Indian literature, the bird has several names, including(one who is fond of arguments),(picturesque eyes),(one with yellow eyes), and(one with yellow legs).</p><p>The two main types of mynah birds kept as pets are the hill mynah and the common mynah. The hill mynah is the variety most Western pet owners get as a pet and is the one that can ""speak"" like a human. The common mynah is most often considered a pest and is one of the most invasive bird species in the world. It was introduced into non-native habitats to help curb insects. The bird was a success as a bug killer, but the territorial common mynah frequently displaced native birds and depleted their food supply.</p><p>A third variety, the Bali mynah, is a rare, critically endangered species. Fewer than 100 Bali mynahs exist in the wild.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Mynah birds are lively, social birds and have wonderfully outgoing personalities. It is friendly, clever, and adapts well to living in cages, which makes it an excellent pet that will breed in captivity. Hand-raised babies are completely socialized with humans and often make better pets. As young birds, they are easier to tame and train to talk. They enjoy human interaction but are not fond of cuddling or learning tricks.</p><p>Younger birds adapt readily to new environments and situations. Expose your new bird early to different people, including both sexes, different age groups, and new situations, such as car trips, visits to the vet, and seeing different rooms of the house. A mynah bird usually bonds closest to the person who gives it the most attention, does speech training, as well as feeds and cleans the cage.</p><p>Mynahs may attack smaller birds. If you keep more than one bird variety, it's best to keep them separate from mynah birds.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>If you get a mynah bird as a pet, be prepared for it to do more than repeat things you say. These birds have a wide and varied vocalization repertoire that includes whistling, screeching, and other noises that are oddly human-sounding.</p><p>Hill and common mynahs are renowned for their ability to mimic the human voice. They can learn up to 100 words. The key toteaching your bird to talkis repetition and patience. Choose the word or phrase you want it to learn and clearly say the word, repeating it over and over again.</p><h2>Mynah Bird Colors and Markings </h2><p>The hill mynah has a black body, an orange-reddish bill, and yellow feet and legs. Its cousin, the common mynah, has a dark-brown body with a black head and throat, and a yellow beak and feet. The rare and endangered Bali mynah has a white body and black tips on its wings and tail and has blue around its eyes and a yellow bill. Both sexes are monomorphic, which means they look alike. Other than genetic testing or seeing which bird lays the eggs, there is no reliable way to tell them apart.</p><h2>Caring for the Mynah Bird </h2><p>Mynah birds are very active and enjoy hopping around from perch to perch.They require a large cage; the minimum cage size for one mynah bird should be 4 feet wide, 2 feet high, and about 2 feet deep. The cage should have several perches set at varying heights and of different widths, diameters, and textures. Variable perch types allow for foot exercise. Natural perches are the best to use.</p><p>Provide a nest box for the bird to sleep in. Keep its cage away from breezes and cover the cage at night to prevent drafts. Also, do not put the cage near the kitchen as mynahs are sensitive to smoke and strong odors.</p><p>Mynah birds like to take baths, so provide a bowl or dish that is large enough for them to splash around in a couple of inches of warm water. Baths help birds maintain their plumage by removing dust, dander, loose feathers, and bird mites, while also providing moisture. Air conditioning and heating systems in homes can dry out a bird's skin. You can also mist your mynah with a spray bottle. Do not put your bird in the shower; the spray from the showerhead may be too strong.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Mynahs have a predisposition to developing certain liver problems and hemochromatosis or iron storage disease. In mynah birds, hemochromatosis seems linked to high dietary iron intake. Carefully manage the amount of iron you provide in the diet.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, the hill mynah's diet is mainly fruit. Meanwhile, the common mynah is omnivorous, eatingfruit,nectar,andinsects.</p><p>In captivity, feed your mynah bird pet a softbill pellet mix that has 18 percent protein, 8 percent fat, and a very little iron to help counteract a disease caused by malabsorption of iron. Pellets should be about 50 percent of their diet.</p><p>You can provide ripe, sweet banana, apple, dates, grapes, peaches, mango, papaya, orange, pineapple, pear, plum, and watermelon. Avoid too many bananas since they contain a lot of sugar. Do not feed dried fruits that are high in iron, such as raisins. Remove the seeds in fruits; they may be toxic. Also, avoid giving green vegetables that are high in iron like peas, green beans, sweet potatoes, and broccoli. Make sure vegetables and fruits are cut into bite-sized pieces; mynahs don't chew their food.</p><p>You can supplement their diet with mealworms, crickets, or waxworms. If breeding your mynahs, mealworms must make up at least 5% of the breeding pair's diet and should be available for the mother to feed the baby birds.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, start off by offering your bird 1/4 cup of pellets and 1/4 cup of fruits and vegetables daily. Increase the amount as needed. Remove the uneaten foods to prevent spoilage.</p><p>Mynahs should always have access to fresh drinking water; distilled or filtered water is preferred.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Mynah birds need exercise and should be allowed out of their cage daily for at least an hour. Before you let your bird out of their cage, make sure that you have closed all of the windows and doors, turned off ceiling fans, and remove other indoor animals.</p><p>Mynah birds enjoy playing with toys, such as mirrors, bells, bottle caps, and other small items. Toys will keep them engaged. Avoid rope toys because they can get caught in your bird's tongue or toenails.</p><p>Social and friendly</p><p>Intelligent and can speak up to 100 words</p><p>Can be loud, so not well-suited for apartments (mainly at dawn and dusk)</p><p>Does not like cuddling or learning tricks</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Mynah Bird </h2><p>Hill mynahs are so popular as pets that demand for the birds far exceeds their capacity to breed in captivity. You're not likely to find a mynah bird in your average neighborhood pet store. Most people buy their pet mynahs from breeders. The birds sell from $500 to $1,500.</p><p>Signs to look for in a healthy bird include clear, bright eyes; clean, smooth feathers; a good appetite; and a curious and active disposition. Steer clear of birds that have discharge from nose or mouth, fluffed feathers for prolonged periods, or birds that sit on the bottom of the cage. After purchasing your new bird, have it examined by your veterinarian.</p>",1345

These birds require a ""hands-off"" approach to bird ownership, which is why they are a wonderful choice for both young andolder bird ownerswho want a bird that is easy to care for. Their elegant in-cage flight maneuvers and soothing songs help put them among the most interesting small bird to keep and observe. However, you might need two or three; they need other finches to keep them company. And, check your local laws as some states ban the ownership of this bird.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Java finch, Java rice finch, Java sparrow, Java temple bird, paddy bird</p><p>Scientific Name: or sometimes (Some scientists group the Java finch and the Timor sparrow together</p><p>Adult Size: 5 to 6 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 10 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>As the name implies, the Java finch is native to the Indonesian islands, including Java, Bali, and Bawean. They can also be found in Sri Lanka, Hawaii, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico.In Java, this finch is a vulnerable species.</p><p>This Asiatic finch typically lives in large flocks on grasslands and savannas. The birds have also found a love for cultivated fields, particularly those growing rice. On many of its native islands, the farmers consider the bird a pest. The birds are banned in some areas where they are not native. If feral populations do arise, they are a threat to local agriculture.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Java finches are little, social birds but often are far too timid for direct human interaction. Some pet owners have reported success in bonding with their finch, though.</p><p>Typically, they thrive in pairs or small flocks kept within a flight cage. These birds should not be a solo pet. In most cases, they will become depressed without another finch to keep them company.</p><p>Beyond that, these birds are quiet, passive, and non-aggressive. They can live with other species of finches, both large and small, without issue. A pair of Javas can be an excellent addition to a diverse aviary. The only time they show aggression is usually between two male Javas, and even that is minimal.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>The Java finch has very calming vocalizations with a signaturesong. Males court females with songs that include a coordinated clicking sound with their beak similar to a drum. This behavior is similar to how a human beatboxes or claps their hands along with a song.</p><h2>Java Finch Colors and Markings </h2><p>The natural coloring of the Java finch includes a gray back and a black headand tail feathers. They have grayish-cinnamon colored breasts and bellies and large white patches on their cheeks. Some people say they remind them of tiny penguins.</p><p>Another distinguishing characteristic of the Java finch is the thin orange ring around their eyes.They also have bright reddish-orange beaks and bright orange skin on their legs and feet.</p><p>Both males and females of the species display the same coloring on their plumage. There are a few ways to tell the sexes apart, though it's not easy without a side-by-side comparison. For instance, the males have darker eyes and a slightly wider, blunter beak that swells at the top during the breeding season. The best way to sex these finches is to look at which bird is singing. While the females do call, only the males sing. It may take a male a long time to sing, though some birders say that after a week of isolation, most will. Differentiating between them can be difficult if you keep a group of finches, but you can do it with careful attention and banding.</p><p>Various color mutations of Java finches occur within the pet trade. These include pied javas, agate javas, black-headed javas, cinnamon or fawn javas, cream javas, dark silver and light silver javas, and white javas.</p><h2>Caring for Java Finches </h2><p>Because of their compact size, these finches have become very popular pet birds among those who have limited space and cannot house a larger bird species. If you are thinking of adopting a Java finch, then you may as well prepare yourself to take in at least two or three.</p><p>The cage required for Java finches should be large enough to allow flight and will vary based on how many birds you decide to keep. Generally, an aviary about7-feet high would be ideal. However, if you cannot accommodate an aviary, you will need a cage that is at a minimum of 18 inches wide by 30 inches long by 18 inches high minimum with 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch bar spacing</p><p>Nesting boxes are not necessary unless you want to breed the birds. Provide plenty of perches, ladders, swings, and toys to keep them happy. They also enjoy bathing, so a dish of water for this purpose will be much appreciated.</p><p>Java finches are prolific breeders and will do so year-round except when it gets too hot or too cold. If you'd like to keep a non-breeding aviary, the best bet is to get same-sex pairs. As an alternative, remove nesting boxes or any laid eggs. To ensure your female doesn't jeopardize her health by continuously laying eggs to replace her ""lost"" eggs, plant fake eggs as decoys.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Java finches are known to be a very hardy species and rarely fall ill if cared for properly. A well-balanced diet will lower the risk of nutritional deficiencies.</p><p>Before introducing a new bird to your aviary, it is always best to quarantine your bird for six weeks and observe if your new bird exhibits any signs of ill health.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Although these birds have become famous for eating rice in the wild, their regular diet consists typically of seeds and fruits. In captivity, Java finches should be fed a good, high-quality seed mix. Feed your finches one to two teaspoons of good quality finch seed mix every day and offer a teaspoon of a specially formulated pellet food.</p><p>Many Java finch owners report success feeding them parakeet formulated mixes rather than finch food. Java finches will pick out any seeds they don't want and leave a considerable mess, so it's important to adapt the food to what they eat.</p><p>Supplement their seed mix and pellets with nuts, grains, and finely chopped, bird-safe fruits and vegetables. Your birds will also enjoy crushed egg or oyster shells, which provides extra calcium. Most javas are not fond of cuttlebones.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Like all finch species, these are incredibly active little birds that seem to have endless amounts of energy. A tall flight cage will give them the room to fly, play, climb, jump, and exercise.</p><p>These birds make ideal pets for people who don't have enough time to bond and interact with a parrot or other bird; they do not require out-of-cage playtime. As long they have another bird and plenty of toys, they're great at entertaining themselves.</p><p>Not too loud and has a beautiful song</p><p>Does not require out-of-cage time or interaction</p><p>Gentle, non-agressive bird that usually gets along with other birds</p><p>Requires a large cage or aviary to get the exercise this energetic bird needs</p><p>Gets lonely easily; should be house with at least one to two companion birds</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Java Finch </h2><p>These birds are illegal to possess in California, Georgia, Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Kentucky, New Hampshire, Florida, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Wyoming, Maine, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Or, your state may require a permit to own this species. There is legislation pending regarding legal ownership of these birds in several states. Before getting a Java finch, check with your State's Fish & Wildlife Department.</p><p>Java finches are sold bybreeders and can sometimes be found through adoption agencies. They can cost $50 to $100, depending on the color mutation.</p><p>If you are going the breeder route, ask the breeder long they have been breeding and working with the species. If you can, tour their facility. Look forsigns of good overall healthof the flock. The birds should be active and alert with bright eyes, clean feathers, and full crops.</p>",1326

Nicknamed ""pocket parrots"" for one of their favorite hiding spots, they have become increasingly popular pets. Their small size and quiet nature make them an ideal choice for people who live in apartments or condos or those who do not have the space to house a larger bird. Some can learn to talk quite well, although it is not known for being a big talker. They make perfectly affectionate and adorable pets.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Parrotlet, pocket parrot, Pacific parrotlet, celestial parrotlet, and Lesson's parrotlet</p><p>Adult Size: 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 inches, weighing about one ounce</p><p>Life Expectancy: 20 to 30 years in captivity</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The Pacific parrotlet is found in Central America and South America. They are most prevalent in Peru and Ecuador. They live in the tropical forests.</p><p>It is common for these tiny birds to gather in flocks of 100 or more. Some flocks get so large; they look like clouds of smoke in the sky. Parrotlets will spend hours each day in the trees where they forage for fruit and seeds or on clay cliffs.</p><p>Parrotlets are ""true"" parrots, and their closest relative is the Amazon parrot. Although the two species differ significantly in size, they have striking similarities in appearance and temperament.</p><p>Pacific parrotlets have not been bred in captivity long, however, they are the most common parrotlet species kept as a pet. Other popular species include the Mexican parrotlet , the spectacled parrotlet , and the yellow-faced parrotlet .</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>You get all of the large-parrot personality characteristics in a miniature package. These birds may be small, but they act like the big guys and require just as much attention.Tame, hand-fed parrotlets make very sweet, affectionate companions. They are often compared to lovebirds.</p><p>Without proper handling, parrotlets can become unruly and impish. They often do best as pets when kept by themselves. They are prone to becoming aggressive toward other birds, especially if they are untamed. Territorial fights might break out during feeding time.</p><p>These miniature parrots may act fearless, but this bravado can get them into danger, especially in a home with dogs and cats. Feisty parrotlets may not back down from a fight with your furry pets.</p><p>Parrotlets are just as intelligent as any other parrot. They can be trained to do a few tricks. Some individuals can talk.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>These little birds do not reach the piercing decibels of the larger parrots. Their voice is almost whisper-soft, and their vocabulary can reach 10 to 15 words, which is quite impressive for their size. They will screech and chirp since they are naturally very vocal, but their noise should not be bothersome for neighbors.</p><h2>Pacific Parrotlet Colors and Markings </h2><p>Pacific parrotlets are adorable with their miniature parrot features. Their tiny tails are delicate, and their curved beaks and large head perfectly mimic their larger cousins. They also havezygodactyl feet, meaning two toes point forward and two toes point toward the rear.</p><p>This bird's normal coloration is mostly green. Parrotlets also come in many color mutations, such as lutino, blue, and albino.</p><p>This a dimorphic species, which means there are noticeable differences between males and females. Males can be distinguished from females by the splashes of bright blue on their backs and behind their eyes.</p><h2>Caring for Pacific Parrotlets </h2><p>While parrotlets may be small, they are by no means low-maintenance. They are naturally easier to clean up after compared to larger birds. However, they require socialization and handling daily to keep them tame.</p><p>As with all parrots, bored parrotlets can become destructive. This can include nipping people, chewing up things around your home, or self-mutilating behavior. Proper training, positive reinforcement, engaging toys, and daily attention are the best ways to keep your parrots content.</p><p>Compared to other parrots, parrotlets are rather good at entertaining themselves. Supply them with plenty of stimulating toys in their cage. The minimum cage size for this bird should be 18 inches square. The bigger the cage, the better. The bar spacing should be no bigger than 1/2- to 5/8-inch.</p><p>Supervise the period that the bird is out of the cage. These birds are so small and delicate that it's easy to have an accident if they are on the floor or hopping around on furniture. To prevent accidents or injury, early on set boundaries for the bird. Teach the bird to remain on a play stand. Diligently set the bird back on it every time it gets off.</p><p>These ""pocket parrots"" can often be seen poking their head out of a shirt pocket for a quick petting on the head. This is a fun, engaging activity for the bird. To your fine-feathered friend, your pocket is the perfect carrying pouch that keeps it right where it wants to beright next to you.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Like most parrots, these birds require out-of-cage time and socialization with you. If your bird feels neglected or bored, it may resort to feather plucking and even skin picking, which can become a severe health concern.</p><p>In general, parrotlets are hardy little birds that do not typically get diseases. They can live, on average, up to 30 years in captivity. However, bacteria, viruses, and harmful fungus can make any bird susceptible to illness. These harmful organisms can cause psittacosis (bacterial respiratory infection), Pacheco's virus (fatal herpes infection), and aspergillosis (fungal lung disease). There are a host of even rarer avian diseases that can also affect parrotlets.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Pacific parrotlets have a speedy metabolismand must have food available at all times. They are known for their voracious appetitesand thrive on a varied diet. In thewild,parrotletsfeed on blossoms, seed heads, fruits, and berries.</p><p>Their diet should consist of fresh bird-safe fruits and vegetables, small seeds, high-quality commercial pellets, and nutritious protein sources such as eggs. They should also have access to a cuttlebone as a calcium source, particularly if a female is egg-laying.</p><p>Fruits and veggies should make up 50 percent of a parrotlet's diet. A high-quality bird pellet should account for 35 percent. The remaining 15 percent should be a low-fat seed mix primarily consisting of barley, millet, cantaloupe, flax, or grass seeds.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Very active, parrotlets need plenty of room to play and manytoys for playtime. They are curious little birds and will get into your things if you don't provide them with toys of their own.</p><p>If you want to own parrotlets, you should be sure that you can set aside a bird-safe area for your bird to play at least one to two hours a day. They need to be able to come out of their cage, stretch their wings, and exercise their leg muscles to maintain their physical and mental health.</p><p>Introduce new things like toys and ladders to the bird's cage, which will help keep it intrigued and occupied. Swings, leather, wood, knotted rope, bells, and beads are among a bird's favorite items, though anything shiny or brightly colored will capture their curiosity.</p><p>Providing a random branch once a week can be a delight and help curb the bird's instinct to chew and climb. You can create foraging challenges that will test your bird's food hunting abilities as well. Safe woods include apple, pear, cherry, willow, ash, poplar, elm, horse chestnut, walnut, alder, and maple.</p><p>This bird is the perfect size for a cute birdie tent. It will sleep in the tent or on a swing. Once the bird matures and their nesting nature kicks in, remove the tent if it causes the bird to become aggressive.</p><p>Small-sized, don't require as much space</p><p>Quiet, although may be trained to talk</p><p>Affectionate</p><p>Small size makes them more delicate</p><p>Can be feisty, bullish, and temperamental</p><p>Can get destructive if bored</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Pacific Parrotlet </h2><p>Most bird rescues list their birds on online search databases like Adopt a Pet and Petfinder. If you want to know what it is like to live with one, contact a local breeder or parrot adoption agency and ask if you can visit their birds.

This species is hardy and relatively easy to care for. It is an excellent choice for a first-time bird owner. Zebra finches are typically kept in pairs and entertain themselves without a lot of interaction with their owners. This species is a good choice if you don't have a lot of time to spend with your pet bird. Other finches may be more brightly colored, but few are easier to keep successfully than zebra finches.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Zebra finch, chestnut-eared finch, spotted-sided finch, and Australian Aboriginal names ""nyi-nyi"" and ""nyeen-ka""</p><p>Adult Size: 4 inches long; one of the smaller (though not the smallest) finches</p><p>Life Expectancy: 3 to 15 years, although 3 to 5 years is typical</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>Zebra finches live in large flocks in its native habitat ofthe arid areas of central Australia, Indonesia, and East Timor, too. The zebra finch has been introduced to Costa Rica and Portugal, where wild flocks now exist. Its preferred habitat includes a range of grasslands and forests, preferably close to water.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Zebra finchesare small birdsthat are active and fun to watch. Although small, the zebra finch needs a large cage for flight.</p><p>All finches are social and should be kept in pairs. A male and female pair will usually breed quite readily, so you may want to consider keeping only females. Some people recommend keeping them either in pairs or in groups larger than six. If you keep more than a pair, you will need a larger cage, such as a flight cage or aviary.</p><p>Even though they are social with each other, zebra finches do not bond strongly with people. They may become tame, but do not relish handling. With much training, you may get it to come to your hand.</p><p>When it comes to vocalization, the bird emits quiet chirps and peeps that are easy to tolerate. This species should be suitable for apartments or condominium living.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>All finches have a variety of whistles and calls. The zebra finch has a quiet, trilling, conversational song.The father bird usually teaches the young chicks to vocalize. He teaches a song, and they improvise with little trills and whistles to personalize it. Many of their improvisations sound like external sounds they have heard. Some finch owners sing to their birds or play music to inspire them.</p><h2>Zebra Finch Colors and Markings </h2><p>Zebra finches are attractive birds. They are dimorphic, which means you can tell the sexes apart by looking at them. Males have black and white bars on the throat and breast, orange cheek patches, and brown on the sides of the body.Females are gray colored in those spots. Both males and females have red-orange beaks, although themale's beakis much brighter in hue. In captive-bred zebra finches, a wide variety of color mutations are available.</p><h2>Caring for a Zebra Finch </h2><p>When keeping zebra finches, the height of the cage is not as vital as having room to fly horizontally, soa longbut short cage is acceptable. It is a good idea to get the largest cage you can. A good size for a pair of finches is 30 inches long, 18 inches high, and 18 inches wide. If you are going to get a larger group of birds, you'll need an aviary or flight cage. Wire spacing should be 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch.</p><p>Supply a variety of perches, but make sure the cage is not so cluttered that the finches cannot fly back and forth. For perches, you can use dowels in a couple of different sizes, or add some natural branches, perhaps angling them to provide variety, so their feet are not always holding onto the perches in precisely the same way.</p><p>You can provide swings and ladders, although ladders will likely be used as perches instead of for climbing. Consider giving them small bells or hanging toys, although finches are generally not very interested in toys.</p><p>Place the finch cage in a quiet, secure location in your home. Unlike parrots, finches do not crave social interaction with people so, they will be less stressed if kept away from an activity hub.</p><p>Finches tolerate a white range of temperaturesbut avoid placing them in direct sunlight or drafty areas near heat- or air-conditioning ducts. In warmer climates, you can acclimate finches to outdoor aviaries.</p><p>Provide a shallow dish of fresh water several times a week for bathing.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Zebra finches can be prone to a scaly face caused by mites, which requires treatment by a vet. Zebra finches are prone to air-sac mite infection, especially when overly stressed. If you want the bird to live, this serious condition needs immediate veterinary care. If your bird ever appears to have difficulty breathing, seek help from an avian veterinarian immediately.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, most finches forage for seeds from plants, weeds, pine cones, and berries. Some finches chew up fruits to get to the seeds while leaving the rest of the fruit behind.</p><p>To mimic their foraging instinct, put food dishes on the floor (not under perches). Or, you can attach their feeder to the side of the cage.</p><p>Feed your finches one to two teaspoons of good quality finch seed mix every day. Check to make sure that the brand you get is fresh by sprouting the seeds (put some in a plastic bag with a damp paper towel). If the seeds do not sprout, then the seeds are too old to feed. Seeds are at peak nutritional value when sprouted.</p><p>A variety of greens should be provided, including romaine lettuce, dandelion greens, kale, and spinach (in moderation), along with a variety of fresh vegetables and fruits. Give about a tablespoon of this salad or chopped fruit/vegetable mixture. Never give avocado; it is toxic to most birds.</p><p>Experiment to find what they like and keep offering a variety. It may take your finches a few tries to accept new food items.</p><p>Provide a teaspoon of pelleted food daily. Pellets are a formulatednutrition source, which is good to offer as part of a varied and balanced diet. Be persistent in getting your finches to accept the pellet food.</p><p>Other supplements you can offer a couple of times a week include eggs or a commercially prepared egg food supplement. This is great for all birds and is essential for breeding birds. Provide cuttlebone as a calcium supplement; birds also use it to hone their beaks. Grit is not supported anymore as a supplement for finches. But, if you offer it, only provide a few granules at a time and very rarely.</p><p>For a treat, millet sprays are a big favorite. Offer it occasionally; you do not want your bird to develop a preference for millet and exclude other foods.</p><p>Provide fresh drinking water daily. Clean out all food dishes need at the end of the day.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>These small birds get most of their activity from straight-line flights across the cage, as well as climbing on perches and branches. Make sure your cage or aviary is large enough for flying. They don't require much more in the way of exercise.</p><p>Quiet, low-volume chirper; good pet for apartment living</p><p>Does not require exercise time with you</p><p>Good first pet bird</p><p>Not affectionate or social with humans</p><p>Needs a larger cage for flight</p><p>Does not like handling</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Zebra Finch </h2><p>Zebra finches are usually sold at pet stores, by breeders, and can be found at rescues or through adoption agencies.

81,https://www.thesprucepets.com/pet-canaries-1236727,Birds > Pet Bird Species > Small Bird Breeds,<h1>Canary: Bird Species Profile</h1>,"<h1>Canary: Bird Species Profile</h1><h2>Temperament, Diet, and Care Tips</h2><p>A canary is an undemanding little charmer that is usually a beginner's cana bird. This small finch has the power to turn most people into lifelong canary enthusiasts. It is a pleasant companion bird with a cheerful disposition. It communicates its content with a melodious song that is soft and pleasant. The canary has been carefully bred to be available in a variety of colors, sizes, and singing varieties. Canaries are inexpensive birds that you can get at just about any pet store.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Names: Canary, domestic canary</p><p>Scientific Name: </p><p>Adult Size: 4 3/4to 8 inches, weighing less than 1 ounce</p><p>Life Expectancy: 5 to 15 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>The wild canary is a small finch that is native to the Macaronesian islands of the Azores, Madeira, and the Canary Islands. Bred in captivity since the 17th century, the bird arrived in Europe by way of Spanish sailors after the conquest of the Macaronesian islands. The canaries sold in pet stores are now genetically quite different from their wild canary ancestors.</p><p>Canaries readily breed with other species of finches. This hybridization yields unique canaries. For example, red canaries resulted from the breeding of domestic canaries with red siskins, a South American finch.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Canaries enjoy being around people but do not appreciate heavy handling in the way that budgies and parrots do. Canariesare intelligent birds. Many owners can train theircanaryto sit on their hand, move to a perch, or direct the bird to fly around the room. Young birds are easier to train, but you can tame and train mostcanarieswith enough patience and consistent practice.</p><p>The canary is a relatively solitary bird; it will not get lonely if housed alone in a cage. It can also coexist in an aviary environment with other small birds. They only no-no is housing two male canaries together in a single cage, as they will likely fight.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>The song canary is one of the most popular kinds of canary. Song canaries, specifically males, are bred to sing. The most popular types are the Waterslager, the German Roller, the Russian Singer, the Spanish Timbrado, and the American Singer.Female canaries vocalize mostly with chirps, while males can develop elaborate songs. Canaries do not sing at all during their molting period.</p><h2>Canary Colors and Markings </h2><p>The wild canary is greenish yellow over most of its body with yellow underparts. Due to the selective breeding of the domestic canary, canaries come in an array of bright colors, including orange, white, red, and yellow. Yellow is the most common color for the domestic canary.</p><h2>Caring for the Canary </h2><p>A single canary needs a cage that is at least 20 inches wide and 24 inches long. These birds like to fly about, so if possible, give them a cage that is longer than it is wide to provide the flying space they desire. A pet canary should never have itswings clipped; it needs to fly for exercise. Cage bars should be spaced relatively close together (no more than 1/2 inch wide) to prevent the bird from getting its head caught between the bars. Wire cages are easier to clean than wood cages.</p><p>Wood perches of varying diameters (3/8 to 3/4 inch) should be placed around the cage to provide places for your canary to rest and exercise its feet. Whittle notches into the smooth round perches with a saw blade or utility knife tomake the perch surface slightly irregular. These notches make the poles easier to grip. Perch variety helps keep your bird's feet limber. Refrain from usingsandpaper perch covers. They can cause harm to your canary's feet.</p><p>Canaries are hardy birds that can be kept at room temperature, but keep the cage away from drafts, air conditioners, and windows that receive direct sunlight (the canary can get overheated). If you notice a canary's mouth agape and its wings held away from their body, that is a sign it is hot.If you see that the bird is puffed up a lot, that can be a sign it is too cold.</p><p>Provide ashallow dish of water or a special bath bought at a pet store at least three or four times a week for the bird to soak in or flit around in the water.</p><p>Cover the cageat night. Canariesneed their rest and will do best if given a light/dark cycle that approximates natural conditions. It is not healthy to keep canaries up late at night with artificial light, which can stress them out.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Rare health issues that affect canaries are usually due to poor diet, a dirty cage, or drafts. Ill birds can lose weight and die very quickly, so get help from an avian veterinarian immediately if the bird develops baldness, scaly legs,diarrhea, constipation, or lethargy. Canaries are sensitive to air quality, so do not smoke around them or keep them in rooms where there are cooking vapors or fumes from solvents.</p><p>Canaries are susceptible to certain viruses, fungi, and bacteria. They can get several treatable bacterial yeast infections like avian gastric yeast infection, candidiasis, and chlamydia. Other bacterial infections that can affect canaries are bumblefoot, which causes foot swelling and lesions; mycoplasma, a treatable condition that causes eye and nasal discharge; and tuberculosis, a non-treatable, fatal respiratory disease.</p><p>The viruses that will kill canaries include the avian pox and the polyomavirus. Aspergillus is usually a fatal fungal infection, but in some cases, it may respond to antifungal treatment.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>In the wild, canaries forage for seeds supplemented with an occasional insect.</p><p>Feed domestic canaries a good quality seed mixture (coated with vitamins) that is explicitly designed for canaries. Remove the seed hulls of the eaten seeds that litter the top layer of bird feeder daily; your canary needs easy access to its food. You can offer a canary pellet food as well, but it is not as palatable as seeds. Leave a dish of pellets in the cage along with a dish of seeds as food options.</p><p>Offer your canary daily supplements of vegetable greens such as kale, broccoli, dandelions, spinach, celery, peas, and watercress and small amounts of apples, oranges, grapes, bananas, or melons. Provide bits of a hard-boiled egg as a protein supplement.</p><p>Your canary must have fresh water at all times.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>Canaries need to move around. Minimize the clutter in its cage to give it space to move about from perch to perch. Unlike parrots that require a lot of enrichment materials, a canary is fine with just a single toy, mirror, or branch in its cage. If your bird uses the birdbath, that splashing about counts as exercise. Offer a swing, bells, or hanging wooden or acrylic toys as a special treat.</p><p>Once the bird is accustomed to you, allow the bird out once a day to fly about the room. It only needs about an hour of flight time. Fully supervise its outside cage time. Keep all windows closed, turn off ceiling fans, and keep other pets out of the room.</p><p>Inexpensive, good beginner bird</p><p>Melodious songster</p><p>Can be trained to fly to you</p><p>Not naturally a hands-on bird</p><p>One of the least needy of pet birds</p><p>Small-sized, needs smaller cage</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Canary </h2><p>Most pet stores sell canaries, but if you are looking for a unique variety, you may need to seek out a breeder. It is worth contacting rescue organizations and adoption societies to see if canaries are available, although it's rare to find this easy-to-care-for bird up for adoption. The average price range for a canary can run $25 to $200, depending on the variety. To find canaries online, look at Adopt a Pet, Petfinder, and Bird Breeders.</p><p>If you're going the breeder route, make sure that the breeder is reputable by asking them how long they've been breeding and working with the species you're interested in and take a tour of the facility.</p>",1295

They are widely available and are birds for those that want a less demanding pet.</p><p>Knowing more about these little doves can help you provide the best care possible.</p><h3>Species Overview</h3><p>Common Name(s): Diamond dove</p><p>Adult Size: About 7.5 inches</p><p>Life Expectancy: Up to 10 years</p><h2>Origin and History </h2><p>These little doves are native to Australia where they can be found in dry areas near water. Diamond doves usually waddle on the ground looking for food in pairs and will eat both seeds and ants in the wild. They are one of the smallest kinds of doves in Australia and are in the Columbidae family of birds which includes pigeons.</p><h2>Temperament </h2><p>Diamond doves are not biters but they also aren't designed to be handled as they are fragile. They are social, though, and need companionship. It's just that they aren't a bird that is going to want to cuddle with you.</p><p>Another dove can keep them happy as they are not typically going to want to interact with you unless they were a hand-fed baby.</p><h2>Speech and Vocalizations </h2><p>Diamond doves do not talk or mimic sounds. This is an appealing quality for those that prefer a quiet bird companion and many find the soft cooing noise they produce soothing. These coos can vary, but diamond doves do not scream like larger birds.</p><h2>Diamond Dove Colors and Markings </h2><p>Male and female diamond doves look the same except for the colored ring around the eye. Male diamond doves have a larger red/orange ring around the eye when compared to females so this helps to easily pair birds up for breeding.</p><p>The body of a diamond dove is gray and the darker wings have white spots or ""diamonds"" on them which gives this bird its name. Due to selective breeding in captivity, white and silver diamond doves can also be found.</p><h2>Caring for the Diamond Dove </h2><p>Diamond doves require different care than parrots. These little birds need more horizontal rather than vertical space since they spend a lot of time on the ground and flying back and forth.</p><p>They do not climb like parrots do either, so do not expect them to spend time hanging on the cage bars. They will sit on branches and a nest must be provided to allow a diamond dove to rest.</p><p>Cage floors should be solid surfaces instead of bars to allow these birds to waddle on the ground. Garden-like aviaries are great places to allow diamond doves to fly, as long as they are safe and enclosed.</p><h2>Common Health Problems </h2><p>Diamond doves are prone to red mites and respiratory issues including canker and pneumonia. Preventing drafts and keeping a clean environment are important things to do to minimize the chances of a bird getting sick. Overall though, diamond doves are usually pretty healthy birds.</p><h2>Diet and Nutrition </h2><p>Unlike parrots, diamond doves do not use their beaks to break and crush food so they need grit added to seeds designed for doves and pigeons.</p><p>Fresh greens, soft fruits, and the occasional bit of hard-boiled egg should also be offered, but the bulk of a diamond dove's diet will be seed.</p><h2>Exercise </h2><p>All birds should be given the opportunity to safely fly, even if it is just for a few hours a week. Aside from flight time, diamond doves also need a flat surface to walk around on.</p><p>No climbing will be seen with these birds, but horizontally long cages, instead of tall cages, can allow some space to fly around if a safe flight zone is not available.</p><p>Quiet</p><p>Small</p><p>No talking or mimicking</p><p>Not a good bird for handling</p><h2>Where to Adopt or Buy a Diamond Dove </h2><p>Diamond doves are often found at both large and small pet stores as well as bird specific stores. Bird breeders and bird rescues are other sources to check for a diamond dove, but they are usually not difficult to find. Costs average around $75-$125 per bird.</p>",652
